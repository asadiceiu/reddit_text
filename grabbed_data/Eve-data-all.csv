0,vulnerability,Eve,World War Bee - TCAG-3 Show down -Battle Report,8,hmjc9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/hmjc9o/world_war_bee_tcag3_show_down_battle_report/,2020-07-07 09:40:42,"The whole battle is based on what I can see from the Killboard with respect to the value of loss. Legacy seems to have formed with their full force to reinforce TCAG-3 I-HUB as their primary objective. We need to remember that TCAG-3 is a hotspot now that both Imperium and Legacy are fighting it out there often. The Battle started pretty well for Legacy, to be frank it was an awesome start for Legacy. Legacy started hacking the I-HUB during the window of vulnerability and started to have upper hand by having about 600+ players from 10 different alliances in the system at one point. By the looks of it, the composition had Eagles, Jackdaws and multiple munnin fleets supported by Bombers and Smart bombers. The initial efforts to tackle the invasion from Imperium looks like a Interceptor fleet with Burst Jammers to jam the Entosis ships from stopping their progress on entosis. Cheeky and seems like they did break the entosis while the actual fleets were arriving. 20:28 - Imperium lost 1b in Ceptors and Legacy had 0 losses (Pretty bad start for Imperium even thought it is interceptors) When Imperium Sacrilege Fleets entered TCAG the I-HUB seems to have already making progress with Imperium. The TiDi was at peak stopping any fleet from making major progress but Imperium fleets were not able to make it into TCAG-3 for defense quicker. 20:37 - Imperium lost 1.8b and Legacy Started taking their first losses standing at 600mil A good bomb run can turn the battle around, we had it in this battle 20:38 - Imperium stood at 13b loss after a successful TEST Bomb Run and Legacy were standing at 850mil loss At this point Legacy did extreme damage to Imperium Fleet, Both Fleets started engaging while bomber fleet made a huge dent on Imperium Fleet. 20:45 - Imperium stood at 22.5b loss and Legacy were comfortable at 3.5b loss due to the loss of Smartbombing macharials. The trade was at 126 ships lost from Imperium and 29 from Legacy 20:50 - Imperium kept losing ships standing at 30.2b loss and Legacy was at 4.9b loss 20:55 - Imperium Lost about half their fleet with 36.8b loss and Legacy was getting scratched at 6.8b 21:00 - Imperium Kept getting hammered due to loss of DPS on Field with 41.3b loss and Legacy was at 9.6b mostly not losing any of their main line DPS ships This point the defense fleets usually bail out and reduce the loss but the Imperium stood their ground for some reason. 21:05 - Imperium lost more than half their fleet and support ships with 47.5b loss and Legacy stood at 11.4b loss still not losing any of their main line DPS ships 21:10 - Imperium started regaining control with their early loss even with less than half of what Legacy had on field. Imperium lost about 48b and Legacy started losing ships slowly standing at 13.5b Till this point for some reason Imperium decided not to drop their capitals even though they were losing heavily on the fight and Legacy had way more numbers on the field. A mistake? 21:15 - Imperium Decided to use their home advantage and dropped Capital ships like Carriers and Dreads, standing at a loss of 49.4b and Legacy was at a loss of 17.4b 21:20 - Imperium were slowly regaining from their bleeding standing at 49.9b and Legacy stood at 18.1b. TiDi made sure no one can do anything at this point, it was bad earlier as well but Capitals!!!. 21:25 - Imperium lost few more ships with a loss of 53b while Legacy started pulling out of the fight standing at 18.5b loss. This point Legacy Lost their Objective and the strategic goal but won the ISK war. Bailing seems to be the only right option ensuring no further loss is had. 21:30 - Imperium Kept losing their ships while legacy pulled out of the fight standing at 58.2b and Legacy stood at 20b loss. Legacy bailed from the fight and went G-M4GK to ensure taking the ISK trade victory which stood at 3:1 21:35 - Imperium stood at 59b loss and Legacy retreated to Paragon Soul with 23.3b loss at least that is what everyone though At this point the battle seems to have come to an end with Imperium Saving TCAG-3 while Legacy had a ISK victory over Imperium retreating to try again on the objective of Capturing the I-HUB later 21:40 - Imperium chased Legacy to get some kills standing at 59b loss and Legacy losing some more ships standing at 26.3b 21:45 - Imperium Maintained the 59b loss but for some reason Legacy started getting killed on the gate standing at 28.8b. Possibly Legacy decided to give a fight or someone did a mistake (both are mistakes at this point) 21:50 - The Battle seems to have come to an end with no losses on both sides. 22:00 - Loss report closed at 59.1b for Imperium and 29.5b loss for Legacy [URL End of the Battle, Imperium seems to have won the strategic battle by stopping the invading Legacy forces from reinforcing the I-Hub but had to sacrifice double the ISK to Legacy. At one point Legacy had 3:1 upper hand on ISK trade which looked an awesome outcome of the Battle even though the objective is lost. Eventually at the end, the ratio came down to 2:1 but still having Legacy winning the ISK battle even though losing the objective. Legacy fielded about 800 players from about 10 alliances losing 294 ships standing at 29.5b loss and Imperium Fielded about same 800 players from 6 alliances even though half of them either came very late or died very early losing overall 367 ships. Imperium having an Home advantage should have dropped Caps pretty early but decided not to, costing their side dearly. Legacy could have counter dropped but at that point it was not worth it as the objective was already lost and the loss trade was at 3:1. By the looks of it Legacy used their Bomber runs effectively to decimate Imperium Fleet but if my source is correct Imperium used their Interceptor fleet to delay and disrupt Legacy's Objective. Imperium also looked to have got invaded by other Alliances part of the Legacy or Blued by Legacy (Don't have the current list) in various system around Querious, Period Basis, Fountain but not sure if a major number of systems got reinforced. Goonswarm Federation currently have 4 I-Hubs reinforced in the Sov they own and TEST Alliance have about 25 I-Hubs reinforced according to timerboard while I am writing this post. I tried my best and the details might not be correct or exactly accurate but the best I can do."

I'm attempting to catalog the various skirmishes and events in a simple easy-to-read format. While there are many layers to any conflict, some not seen and others showing themselves in various chat channels and propaganda, I would like to give the most people possible a layman's understanding. I have done my best to give the best battle reports and context but if you would like to submit corrections or feedback, please DM me on Discord at January Valentine#9887. If you like, check out my new blog: [URL where I'll be cross-posting this and other stories I find interesting. * **Period Basis** At approximately 1600 the IHUB in system of [XZ-SKZ](URL came out of its reinforcement timer. This system is quite important as it is in jump range of almost the entirety of Period Basis excluding the westernmost constellation and the southernmost constellation of Delve, granting huge control of the entire region and establishing a beachhead into Delve. The Imperium assembled a Baltec (Megathron/Bhaalgorn battleship) fleet of over 200 ships including 87 Megathrons, 39 Bhaalgorns and 28 Guardians along with over a dozen HAW dreadnoughts and several FAXes. Under fleet commanders [Apple Pear](URL and [Alfius Togra](URL they set up on the [CJF-1P](URL gate in XZ-SKZ. CJF-1P is the regional gate in Stain that Legacy forces had to come through. The Legacy forces included a whooping 385 Munnins and 18 Cerberus from [Invidia Gloriae Comes](URL with 79 Scimitar logistical support, 55 Machariels from Siberian Squads with their fleet commander [Hanzo Viper](URL 11 Claymore command ships and tactical destroyer/frigate wing composed of 40 jackdaws, 32 crucifiers, and 14 Harpy assault frigates. This is the first time Fraternity, the once bitter enemy of Legacy Coalition, was on-grid offensively as they, along with members of Brave, Evictus and Warped Intentions composed most of the Munnin fleet. Legacys opening move was a bombing run that attempted to clear some of the sentry drones the Megathrons had dropped. The Confessor tactical destroyers sitting next to the megathrons cleared most of the most incoming bomb waves. Combined with the HAW revelations perched above the gate and the sniping sentry drones from the megathron fleet, the gate was surrounded with attackers' wrecks as they struggled to get out of the bubbles. Despite that, Hanzos Machariel and the IGC Cerberus fleet slipped past and started work on entosising the node. Legacy would pay for that node [losing](URL 21.6b isk over 234 ships compared to Imperium forces losing only 4.5b over 43 ships. Concurrently, the bulk of TEST Alliances forces were next door in [35-JWD](URL next door to another Imperium fleet in [0-NTIS](URL TEST was bringing over 3 fleets worth of ships with 538 being Munnins and Eagles and 25 command ships under fleet commanders [ShutUpAndShave](URL and [Manfred Sideous](URL Anticipating an extremely large fleet, The Imperium had placed over 100 carriers - archons and thanatos on the in-gate to the system. Once again, the Legacy fleet jumped through and moved past the gate camp of carrier fighters, paying approximately 10b in heavy assault cruisers to do so. Despite that, they would trade more evenly, [losing](URL 18.2b over 153 ships to Imperiums 18.9b over 127 ships. Surprisingly, despite the large concentrations of forces on the gates, then nodes were mostly free of Imperium forces, allowing Legacy to completely kill the node a little over [an hour later](URL Around 1730 Legacy dropped their own IHUB and completed the entosis making the first system change in the war. The overall fight for the constellation was about [even](URL with Legacy losing 38.6b over 359 ships compared to Imperium which lost 29.2b over 252 ships. * **Fountain** Northern Coalition flipped the system[ I-CUVX](URL in [Hydra constellation](URL of Fountain around the same time as the fight happening in Period Basis. A large Pandemic Horde munin fleet [pushes off](URL a small fleet from The Bastion over the IHUB and [wins](URL the objective losing 210m isk to Imperium losses of 2.9b. The IHUB timer in the system D4KU-5 went uncontested and regenerated back from vulnerability. * **Minor Skirmishes** * Imperium loses two Ansiblex Jump Bridges, the [first one](URL in [U-HYZN](URL in Querious and the [second](URL in [1-SMEB](URL in Delve. The structures were killed undefended. * Imperium bring two fleets, one fleet of 250 Munin and Sacrilege heavy assault cruisers with support along with five Revelation dreadnoughts under fleet commander [kocicek](URL kill a [Caldari Control Tower POS](URL belonging to Black Omega Security in TCAG-3 in Period Basis. * A large Imperium Jackdaw fleet engages with a TEST gate camp fleet on the TCAG-4 gate in G-M4GK. They kill the fighters of the TEST carriers [losing](URL only approximately 270m to TESTs losses of 1.1b. * Pandemic Legion [loses](URL a Ragnarok Titan moving through in the system of [Maseera](URL in Arida by the infamous titan and supercarrier hunting group [LowSechnaya Sholupen](URL * Goonswarm loses four [Amarr Control Tower POSs](URL \- 3 in Paragon Soul in [5AQ-5H](URL [JI-K5H](URL and [ZBY-01](URL and 1 in Esoteria in [HAJ-DQ](URL **Daily Campaign Metrics** For the start date of July 8th to July 9th, the attacking Legacy and Pandafam Coalitions lost approximately 89.5b isk over 1596 ships compared to the defending Imperium losses of 119.9b isk over 1160 ships lost. Corrections that need to be posted will be corrected as soon as I can, rest assured I'm keeping up with all your feedback. The posts and blog posts will be in a constant state of refinement until I get a system I'm happy with. Thank you for your continued kind words and support. :)"
2,vulnerability,Eve,How would everyone feel about covert staging structures?,1,hyglin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/hyglin/how_would_everyone_feel_about_covert_staging/,2020-07-27 08:51:32,So I don't know if this has been suggested before but what if we add a small anchorable structure just for covert staging. They would only be able to hold ships cruiser size and down (maybe an exception for black ops battle ships). They could also have a cloaking functionality to help it stay hidden but this would be kept from being op by either forcing it to uncloak whenever someone docks/undocks or a forced cloak recharge like the current vulnerability mechanic. I was also thinking that there would be a mechanic change that keeps it from being discoverable while cloaked but when uncloaked there is no vulnerability timer. This way as soon as you find it it can be reinforced to keep it from cloaking and only allow it one reinforcement timer. Additionally instead of any real offensive or defensive slots you are able to add a covert cyno and blops bridge. I'm sure someone will hate this idea but I think it would add a good dynamic for small gang covert ops work. Thoughts?
3,vulnerability,Eve,Gallente Stronghold of Nisuwa Falls as Caldari Offensive gains momentum,1,gykxnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/gykxnz/gallente_stronghold_of_nisuwa_falls_as_caldari/,2020-06-08 07:25:28,"AAR - After taking the system of Prism on Tuesday, Caldari forces were once again on the offensive. Mobilising further in to Gallente occupied systems in the Okakuola constellation with a concerted push to liberate the system of Nisuwa, a Gallente Stronghold since the 25th November 2011. Progress was slow at first with pilots from GMVA and other Gallente groups effectively defending the system, managing to return the contested level to stable to from the 10 or 15% Caldari had gained on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday saw the full mobilisation of Caldari Alliances into Nisuwa, including Ghostbirds, Plexodus, Marine Division, Last Republic and UCSC. These Caldari forces were quickly able to build the contested level up and mitigate Gallente recovery over the USTZ on Friday and Saturday. By Sunday morning, Nisuwa stood at 98% with Gallente industrial ships and Jump Freighters seen conducting a mass evacuation of the Nisuwa NPC Station, indicating a loss of morale from the Federation. However, the fight was far from over for the Caldari as they encountered resistance from The Initiative, lead by former Pen Is Out and Spaceship Bebop pilots who had previously flown with Gallente Militia, before and after downtime. Caldari forces inflicted heavy casualties on INIT forces whilst continuing to push the contested level to a vulnerable state, including the killing of a Moros class Dreadnought [URL . State forces managed to hold system vulnerability and buffer for 3 hours before Fleet Commander and Ghostbirds CEO Ganoes Utrigas ordered the final attack on the Infrastructure Hub. Under harassing attack by the INIT fleet, the Caldari forces were able to take the system. As the Caldari fleet aligned out of the area, scouts reported a large Brutix Navy Battle Cruiser fleet from INIT was on approach to the I-Hub. With the objective taken, Caldari forces dispersed. Good Fights to all and special thanks to every Caldari Militia line member, FC and organisation that made this possible. FOR THE STATE."
4,vulnerability,Eve,Could Triglavian mechanics be used to fix other things such as Faction Warfare????,29,h0572q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/h0572q/could_triglavian_mechanics_be_used_to_fix_other/,2020-06-10 16:23:20,"Hey there, I expect the usual trolling etc... Although I'd like to throw out some ideas for faction warfare after fighting within the new Trig mechanics. First of all the Trig content is amazing. While a little buggy due to being understandbly not tested properly (cant mass test something when you want to surprise us with!) I have to say, great job overall CCP! Now to Faction Warfare! This part of the game is in serious need of rework. I have been playing EVE for 10 years and always had some involvement in FW, either with alts or mains. The new mechanics introduced in Chapter 3 of the Triglavian Invasion open up the possibilities for FW and probably other areas, such as NPC null etc... **Complexes** (Novice, Small, Medium etc...) The complexes need some rework badly. Attacking a complex is too easy and can be done with little effort. Whether you are in a frigate or a larger ship you affect the vulnerability of a system the same way. (0.7%) per site. A player only needs to shoot s few ships, wait out a timer and the deed is done. This is too easy. Defelnsive plexing is just sitting on a button and waiting out a timer. My thoughts are to use the new site types and system occpancy system for FW systems. All sites should although require a task to be completed. Such as defending/attacking, a structure or a fleet. Ship size limits could also still be used as it seems they have been in Trig systems. Possibly mix it some sort of mechanic tied back to the Infrastructure Hub in each system. **Missions** Remove missions OR allow missions completed in systems to affect control of the system they are completed in. **Roaming Gangs** Add smart roaming gangs of NPCs that reward tags and/or LP. The higher the system index, the more active the gangs are. The gangs should also go into complexes, sites and open missions and assist their friendly NPCs and shoot at other targets. Missions may be a stretch to include as you dont want the situation of players opening missions and waiting for NPCs to complete them lol... **Faction Warfare Enlistment** With this new standings based system introduced with the Invasions, why the need for Enlistment? Standings with your Militia should be on show for everyone and if your standings are bad enough the other factions police will shoot you in space... Oh thats right they do already. ;) Anyway, thats my initial thoughts... Would love to get this discussion going."
5,vulnerability,Eve,"Dear CCP, Game balancing is all about knowing which hammer you need to pick, allow me to explain.",1,fxqf58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/fxqf58/dear_ccp_game_balancing_is_all_about_knowing/,2020-04-09 20:58:05,"To start with I fully agree that changes are needed in EVE and I fully believe that those who think that is not the case are not able to see the bigger picture or very much are able to see it and realize why keeping the status quo is fully in their benefit. However I do not agree with this latest round of changes (and I still have to see the full effect of the mineral one to make up my mind there) are the changes that will be for the betterment of EVE. It feels like that you (CCP) have decided to say fuck it and start hammering the steel with sledge hammers and power hammers while all you needed was to refine the edge, you already have the blade. &amp;#x200B; The raw number of (super)capitals has been an issue for a good while along with their effectiveness. However they issue here is not much directly with the ship as it is with the game. EVE will always value numbers, specially these days when fleets are often quite well matched ship for ship, the numbers game comes into play a lot. This is why I know a lot of MMO gamers avoid EVE as when the fight escalate you are really just adding X amount of EHP and X amount of DPS to your fleet. The escalating numbers of more capable ships on the field in the forms of capitals and then super capitals comes froth from a overly rich economy and a severe lack of combat, along with the logistical support. If the number of capitals need to be reduced one needs to introduce things into the game that will drive conflict, that make it economically sensible for the large power blocks we have in the game to either go to war with each other or to turn on each other. This will be far easier said then done as the current player counts mean that there is to much space for people to go around, so limiting minerals or perhaps having a roaming sort of resource could be starting ways to see if this will work. Beside that you have been using NPCs more and more and Triglavian stuff to me sounded perfect to have the null folks face off against a truly capable AI opponent that could do some real damage, but sadly this wasn't pushed into that direction and it is something that you should consider. As far as the capital logistics issue, resistances aint the problem and it most certainly is not for the subcaps. This blanket nerve fucks over smaller gangs, PVE players, Solo PVP players, industrials (ganking vulnerability) far more than it will affect the capital fleets of EVE. There are 2 solutions I can see here, 1 is simple and 1 is a bit more complicated, but something that should have been done ages ago imho. The simple solution would be to increase the rate at which logi support gets a diminishing return by a lot. This is a simple change that will overnight make logi in larger scale engagements a lot less powerful both on a capital and a subcapital level. While a blanket still pretty big hammer move it will get the effect you are after without affecting a lot of other players who do not need the nerve. Small gangs will still see their logi being use, but in larger ops they will become less effective and for capital fleets it will become a really noticeable change. Ideally logi power should cap out at 10 ships and anything above that will just be of zero effect. The complex solution would be to create capital grade modules for resistance and make it so capitals cannot fit other modules anymore. In general I believe capitals should have an entire module selection all of their own that does not mix with the supcapital modules. While this would be a lot of work it does allow you in the end as a dev to grab a tiny hammer and just give things a tap here and there to adjust things as needed both on capital and subcapital level. The playing fields between these 2 fleets is not an equal one and that does not have to be a bad thing, but it does mean that adjustments to design are needed and with this change they are made a lot easier. Number of capitals getting lower and their power needs to go up a bit, small wack there and it only affects the capitals no need to worry about the ripple effects throughout the game. &amp;#x200B; Now you also made mention of wanting reward those who close the range, now it should not bear the need to say, but if you nerf the EHP of ships and through it logi as well, you clearly do not understand the game if you believe that will get people to close the range. Nerfing EHP only serves to make sniping more powerful those ships do not care as much about EHP to begin with and their targets now have less of it. EVE is an game about economics end of the day and people will want to achieve their objective as efficiently as possible, reducing losses by whatever means possible is a key factor of this. So lower EHP means people will not go in for the brawl as that means even in a small/medium gang environment a lot of stuff can be killed before logi support can even land. &amp;#x200B; O and 1 final idea that could be worth experimenting with is the range of logi modules, if you reduce the range you reduce the effectiveness as ships will be out of range and logi needs to be in the thick of it making it an easier target as well. &amp;#x200B; Anyhow just my long 2 cents on the whole issue, to those of you who made it through, thanks I guess and I hope I made some sense."
6,vulnerability,Eve,"Did Pirat and HC merge, and why would they try to hide it? A story of how to get at Pirat.",37,fzlflx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/fzlflx/did_pirat_and_hc_merge_and_why_would_they_try_to/,2020-04-12 09:25:20,"**TLDR** **The war declare wing of Hogs Collective, Hog Hitmen, merged into Pirat, and was retired from that point on.** **Pirat and HC continue to work together, and are clearly allies. HC probably contains Pirat alts. They try to hide this with sham wars. Probably to keep the HC large structures several jumps from Jita from being destroyed by all the people Pirat pisses off.** **Naturally, they will deny it.** Pirat has a history of helping HC and defending their expensive large structures as well as destroying structures of their enemies. By HC I refer to the group known as Hogs Collective and their various alt alliances such as Hog Hitmen, Aporkalypse now and RedHogs. Note that RedHogs are in Pandemic Horde. It is known that Pandemic Horde are allied with Pirat. That is why Pandemic Horde declared war against Dead Terrorists and Inner Hell yesterday, to defend Pirat's war HQ. A little while ago, Pirat absorbed the majority of Hog Hitmen's pvpers. The story goes that apparently HC had a falling out and so Hog Hitmen all ditched corp to join up with Pirat. But there's plenty about it that doesn't add up. Like the fact that Pirat and HC are working together as much if not more than they were before. Hog Hitmen was the main high security space pvp alliance of Hogs Collective, war declaring huge numbers of corporations. If you check their war history and zkill history you will see that from 2019 onwards they tried to emulate Pirat. If you check the history of those who left Hog Hitmen, you'll see that most are now in Pirat. The majority of the Hog Hitmen are now in Pirat. Since both groups spend many billions of isk war deccing masses of corporations at a time, joining together would be a good idea to increase efficiency. It makes sense they would merge. Not because there was some falling out, just because it makes sense to consolidate all of the wars into one alliance. And this is something Pirat has done time and time again before, they consolidate the players from the various war corps into the Pirat alliance. A few weeks back, Hogs Collective decided it was going to take over Forge region space. Osmon and Wuos seeming to be their primary targets. They placed a Fortizar and Azbel in these systems and destroyed all other public structures and are still in the process of taking down non public structures. Pirat helps HC to destroy structures that are beyond HC capability. Hogs Collective is an aggressive alliance. They demand you join them, leave, or die. They extort players, and destroy all structures in an area to make players leave. They use their alt structure bashing alliance ""AYPABTU"" and sent everyone in the area the following EVEmail: From: TAFKAEFKAF Hafkenscheid --------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------- Your unlawful structure has been detected in Osmon Unfortunately this is contrary to the current system legislations and will have to be removed. As this is your first offence and we have not yet begun the removal process, we will allow it to immediately unanchor and be moved to a new system in 7 days once unanchoring completes. There will be a Safe Unanchoring fee of 100 mil plus the standard fine of 1/4 the structure base cost, payable to Indefatigable Minions to ensure that you can recover the structure without it's destruction. URL Current pricing for structures are listed in the handy link above, but please realize that prices do fluctuate quickly, you should do your own current price search for your type of structure and use the Jita Sell price *.25 then add that to the 100mil wardec fee. For example: If you had an Astrahus that was unlawfully placed, you would use the Jita Sell price of 800mil * .25 + 100mil or 341 mil isk. Feel free to contact us if you have questions but the easist way to handle this is to: 1. Immediately decommision your structure 2. Send a mail telling us when your unanchoring will be complete. 3. Send the total payment to the corp wallet (to prevent further action against your structure) with the appropriate fee. (in the example above that would be 341 mil.) We will accept that as final payment, no further action will be taken on your structure and we'll confirm the structure is removed on the date and time you provide us. ALTERNATIVELY, we are looking to acquire ONE structure in your system, we would be willing to pay the Jita buy price *.90 for the entire fit, (except the RIGS) it would be a great opportunity but only afforded to one individual and also based on the fit. This offer ends after 24 hours, at which point the War Dec and removal process will be initiated. Cancellation of additional war decs requires an additional 100mill to end hostilities, and the fees increase for each layer we remove. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------- Here's the strange thing. Pirat keeps a war active on AYPABTU, and has regularly come into Osmon local claiming they are there to defend structures from AYPABTU. Speaking in local, they claim to be for hire for anyone who wants Pirat to defend their structure against AYPABTU. Seems like a good scam - AYPABTU are their friends. Despite AYPABTU being entirely incapable of taking on Pirat, AYPABTU has managed to take down all structures in the area while losing only 3 very cheap ships to Pirat the entire time. Hogs Collective has a long history of working with Pirat. So it seems weird in the first place that Pirat is apparently at war with the Hogs Collective structure bashing corp, while failing to stop them from destroying destructures and inflicting hardly any damage on them. A major give away that Pirat and AYPABTU (HC) are really working together is what happened to a difficult to remove corp that owns structures in Osmon. Pirat claims to be coming to Osmon to stop AYPABTU from taking down structures. But then when AYPABTU is in the process of attacking the structures owned by this corp, rather than defend, Pirat attacks the structures. Why? With the AYPABTU war coming to an end (forgot to pay the bill?) Or the fact that the Astrahaus owned by this corp has proven difficult for AYPABTU to take down. Pirat declares war on the corp to make sure the structure is destroyed for AYPABTU. This is evidence that Pirat and AYPABTU (HC) are working together. The Corp in question is aar enterprises. Check their wars. From what I hear this is a common tactic used by HC and Pirat. When it's a difficult structure to take down, tough for AYPABTU, if they can get the structure to the final timer, Pirat declares war and makes sure it is finished off for them. I am sure there are other players who can vouch that they use this tactic. I believe the Pirat wars vs AYPABTU and HC structure owning corp Poco Loco are sham wars, made to obscure the fact that AYPABTU and HC are secretly allies and alts of Pirat. It contains at least some Pirat alts. Pirat could easily destroy the HC/AYPABTU Fortizar and Azbel. But apparently despite their claims in Osmon that they came to defend structures from attack by the HC alts AYPABTU - Pirat just lets AYPABTU get on with taking down structures. Even helping them, which is a big give away that they are working together. If you look at Pirat's killboard history it is clear that they regularly destroy high value structures. Yet even after declaring multiple wars in short order against the HC structure holding corp, they never once attacked them. Unusual for Pirat to declare war on an Azbel and Fortizar, one they could easily destroy, and yet not once attack. Why would they declare war against the HC structure holding corp, you might ask, if they are allies/alts? It's probably because It's a great way to throw enemies off. To hide the truth. These large HC structures are really Pirat owned/allied. Since Pirat has declared war on them a few times, people assume they couldn't possibly be Pirat allies and alts. Remember, most of the Hogs high security war deccers joined Pirat. They need to keep up this charade to obscure the truth, that you can get at them by attacking HC and their expensive large structures just several jumps from Jita. Pirat declares war against the Hogs structure holding corp Poco Loco, but never attacks them or their high value structures. Pirat does this, while taking down target low value structures that Hogs Collective structure bashers AYPABTU by itself was unable to clear away. They are blatantly working together but are trying to hide it. This is the thing that got my attention the most. Why are HC/AYPABTU and Pirat trying to hide that they are working together? Thinking about this, I realised they have good reason to hide it. Pirat would claim HC hired them. But I don't buy it. HC and Pirat have a long history of working together and now the majority of HC pvpers have joined Pirat. It took me a while to put the pieces together. Why does Pirat seem to war declare Hogs Collective and their alt alliances while not making effort to target them. And, yet, come to the aid of Hogs Collective every time HC can't handle something? What do they have to gain from hiding that HC joined into Pirat? If they are hiding it, it must be for a reason. Why did all of the Hog Hitmen pvpers from their high security war alliance leave Hog Hitmen and join Pirat? Was it really because HC had a big falling out? I don't think so. I think they're just trying to hide that they merged because it is imperative to keep this secret to protect the HC highsec structures and alts safe from retaliation by Pirat's many enemies. Most of the pvpers from Hogs Hitmen are now in Pirat. But HC is still contains their pve/mining alts and they intend to continue attempting to take over areas of high sec. They have pve/mining alts in Hogs Collective, operating in high security space from their Azbel and Fortizar. If people knew that a way to get at Pirat was target their alts in Hogs Collective and their structures, that would be a vulnerability and major inconvenience. It would seriously jeopardise their plans to dominate areas of highsec by destroying all other structures in the area and being the only structure owner in said area. Perhaps this is why they hide that HC merged into Pirat. Better to keep players in the dark, than expose a vulnerability. The HC Fortizar and Azbel are effectively Pirat owned and it would be hugely problematic if people were to learn they could retaliate against Pirat by attacking these larger, expensive structures, owned by their alts."

(Capital and subcap interplay),5,g5pc5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/g5pc5z/wheres_my_4d_chess_capital_and_subcap_interplay/,2020-04-22 08:36:18,"[Hello all, I am making short posts on my website addressing my views on some very serious aspects facing eve regarding balance.](URL I love this game immensely, and I want to do everything I possibly can to understand where the problems lie. Here's the post below, to save you a click. # Wheres my 4D chess: Jobs for all or jobs for one? The only way to win against larger numbers in eve is to be smarter. Smarter with your fittings and ship choices, smarter with your tactics and smarter with your on-field piloting. Delegating specialised roles among pilots allows people to focus and perform much more efficiently  this is no big secret and has been the lynchpin of any fleet trying to punch above its weight since the beginning. The introduction of Support and tackle fighters, Capital neuts, High Angle Weapons, Long Range Heavy Fighters, Capital Cap Boosters and 3200s has decimated meaningful subcap and cap interplay. [URL It would be so in the past that capital ships were still very effective killing machines  but only when they had adequate and well organised subcapital support for tackling, webbing and neuting. Tackling to stop your targets getting away, webbing to make them trackable, and neuting to shut off enemy tanking modules  and a key vulnerability to being neuted out in the case of 3200s. [URL With the introduction of all those new abilities, capitals become simply better than subcaps. The way it had been in the past added a new layer of complexity to eve, which, when executed intelligently, made capitals a fantastic force multiplier. The effective gutting of such interplay simply elevated capital ships to the only ships that matter in large scale engagements. They can apply damage by themselves, they can tackle and web by themselves and they can neut by themselves. I am definitely of the opinion that capital and supercapital ships should very well be able to kill subcapitals  I just beleive that they should require intelligent subcapital support to be as effective as they currently are. CCP gave capitals the ability to operate with comparable ease on a plane that is untouchable by subcaps  and in doing so outright removed one of the few areas that smarter pilots could gain an upper hand against larger numbers."

10,vulnerability,Eve,"List of proposed ""things to fight over""",1,f90ir0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/f90ir0/list_of_proposed_things_to_fight_over/,2020-02-25 10:36:06,"Manny made a post earlier about wanting things to fight over, so here's a list of things that came out of a brainstorm. ""Farms and Fields"" is a great concept. The issue is that the fruit of the land is too quickly transferred into unassailable and safe citadels before there is any chance to raid it. To use a medieval comparison, there is no intermediate ""granary"" stage where the resource is harvested but still vulnerable. The theme around most of these proposals is to add a period of vulnerability before resources harvested in space are safe. At the same time, it's important to note that it's possible for activities to be too vulnerable, and for groups to have their income choked off extremely efficiently by a coordinated effort. Whether that's a good thing and allows for resource wars, or a bad thing and forces more people under a bloc umbrella is a matter of debate. **Roaming objectives** Universal Change - You may no longer drop cargo into a citadel that you can not dock at. Goal - There's going to be more loot in space, but if you want to get that loot to safety, get it out by ship. No more depositing and asset safety out. **ESS rework** Details - ESS is now an Ihub upgrade, when installed the ESS spawns 50km above the Ihub. ESS reset and ramping is now on a per character basis, and it is no longer possible to share out other character's money. Using an entosis link on the ESS will cause it to jettison a can with tags after X cycles. Base ratting bounties reduced X%, with full ESS ramp payouts are higher than current and gives LP on top. Goal - Turns the ESS into the tactical objective it's supposed to be. Making ramping personal has two goals. First it seeks to reduce the drama around this module so alliances will allow its placement, second it prevents an alpha in a pod from sitting on the ESS and splitting whenever a neutral enters local. Instead of using a clunky timer and warp disruption, the ESS now requires an entosis link to hack, which adds some stakes for the attacker by imposing self tackle and ship restrictions. If the locals dock up and refuse to come out, you hack their ESS and take their money. If the locals are slow with warping to the ESS to cash out, you catch them on the ESS and kill them. If the locals come out, you get a fight, if the locals bring the super blob, you post on the forums for CCP to nerf umbrella until they actually do it. **Excavator loot rework** Details - Excavators will now leave wrecks when destroyed, said wrecks have a high chance of dropping ""excavator sentient core"" that can be used in an ""Excavator Reconstruction"" blueprint that allows an excavator to be rebuilt for a relatively low price. Goal - This turns excavators into loot pinatas even if you don't have a ship with a 1000m3 bay to carry the things. **In-Situ Processor** Description : Responding to a market demand for more automated moon material extraction. ORE has created the In-Situ Mineral Processor. Advanced nanobots are injected into the moon chunk, extracting, processing, and collecting valuable minerals as the chunk is pulled in by the moon drill. By the time the moon chunk arrives, the accessible minerals have been gathered into an easily transportable package. As the nanobots do not possess the high energy lasers of mining vessels, the amount of minerals they can recover is considerable reduced. Details - Moon drills can be loaded with ""mineral processing nanobots"", which cause the moon chunk to be unfrackable, but instead deposits 10-25% of the moongoo contained in the moon chunk into a container over time. Said container can be hacked with an entosis link to spit out it's contents to a can during the final phases of extraction. Goals - The return of passive moon mining. As this is much lower effort and does not involve placing mining ships on field, the yield is greatly reduced. Rather than having siphons for harassment, entosis links can hack the cargo and spit out it's contents to be looted by harrassers if the defender does not respond. Optional change is to make it so that these extractions can not be precisely timed unlike moon fracks are but rather come out during it's vulnerability period (thus window reduced by ADM), so you still have to live near them to benefit the most. Strategic Objectives Universal Change - Athanor, Tatara, Raitaru, Azbel, and Sotiyo no longer have asset safety and will loot spew on kill. When jobs are cancelled, the materials for the job are placed into an invisible hanger for the next 14 days. This invisible container is eligible for looting. Goals - Resouces can either be safe in a citadel, or unsafe but useable in a non-citadel structure. Nuclear Fracks Description : Nuclear Fracking is a destructive process where high yield munitions are used to break up the lithosphere of a moon to increase ease of extraction and enhance access to valuable minerals. As thermonuclear warheads are imprecise instruments, a large portion of the minerals will be left irradiated and unusable. It's not pretty, but it gets the job done fast. Details - Moon Drills can be loaded with Thermonuclear Fracking Charge. Nuclear Fracking will create an ""enriched"" 600% value 14 day frack (50% higher than a normal 56 day frack). Fracks generated by Nuclear Fracks are optimized for barges with many smaller rocks. After a moon has been nuclear fracked, it generates ""poor quality fracks"" for fracks started in the next 180 days, with low yield mineral variants and can not jackpot. While an Athanor is preparing a nuclear frack, it is more vulnerable (shorter timers, wider windows, whatever). Killing the Athanor before the end of the Nuclear Frack will cancel the frack. Goals - Nuclear Fracks exchange long term yield for short term gain. A defender that is overmatched can set their Athanors to nuclear frack as a ""fuck you"" to scorch the earth and deny resources. An attacker who is able to blitz down these Athanors can plant their own and reap 12 weeks worth of moongoo in 2. Nuclear Fracks allow a short return on investment of Athanors if you don't care about holding it in the long term. Random/Other ideas - Skiffs have a +20% warp scramble range bonus on Exhumer skill - Light fighters removed from Supercarriers, Supercarriers now have 4 tubes of heavy fighters - Light Fighter and SF Fighter DPS decreased by 33%, Carriers now have 4 tubes of light fighters/light support fighters"

Avoid them easily with this.",1,ea5sd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ea5sd8/there_is_currently_hypernet_scams_taking_place_en/,2019-12-14 02:59:47," There are currently classic lottery scam hypernet offers being spammed in locals by various people, it is directly and outrightly scamming people out of billions of isk in a stealthy way. Welcome to the new age of Jita scams. **The Scam and how it works.** The hypernet is a fun tool, however it's open to a classic lottery scam vulnerability. Here is how the scam works. Player (Scammer.) Sets up a hypernet offer for an item, that for purposes of explanation shall we say is worth (After hypernet costs) 500 million isk. They set the sell price at dramatically larger than the items value, say, 1 Billion isk in this example. They then buy a large proportion of the tickets. Generally as much as they can so that any tickets not bought by them covers both the item cost and hypernet cost and tax cost. They may use various alts to buy these tickets, starter corps, other friends, anybody who's ""In"" on it. In this example lets say 450 million isk of tickets. They then list these offers in Alliance chat and try to incentivize people into buying tickets to help people ignore the high cost (If you the item, we'll give you your isk back too!) Unknowing people, buy these tickets, up until the point the offer is filled. In our example this would be 550 million isk of tickets. The tickets bought equate in isk to covering the admin costs of listing, and the cost of the item itself. Then 1 of 2 things happen. **A)** Either people win the item in the raffle, which is **fine for the scammers**, because **they covered the cost by it being overpriced and can just relist** a new raffle. **OR B) THEY WIN THE ITEM BACK, AND ALL OF YOUR ISK BACK, THEN RELIST THE OFFER TO CONTINUE THE SCAM.** The ONLY way they can lose, is if the tickets don't sell and people are refunded and they lose the taxes/listing costs. **This leads to an outcome, where they can repeatedly use an item to draw billions of isk out of people, capped only by the highest item value.** **In hypernet offers like this, we can only ever lose large proportions of isk collectively to the scammers.** **This is a common lottery scam in the tourist industry and is well known amongst scam circles. It was used reguarly in I want isk raffles and Somber Blink.** **What I am NOT complaining about.** **To those who personally feel that my issue was with people overcharing on hypernet**. **THAT IS NOT THE CASE** People can charge what the fuck they want, we all know that. This **Specifically** is **JUST** the ***Scam*** method above I am talking about. **What can be done to spot, avoid and or fix this.** For ourselves we can't stop people posting offers like this. What we can do is kick the people who aim to use this to abuse goonswarm in this manner. These offers are very easy to spot when you understand them, you can see them from the following signs. * First advertisement you see, will pretty much **Guarenteed** have a large proportion of tickets * Generally the amount of tickets left not bought by normal members will equate to the item and hypercost price, as **excess increases the risk of the scammer not getting the item back**. * Most of the tickets at first advertisement, will not be bought by goonswarm members, as that would easily identify the people involved and is un-necessary risk. * You will frequently see the same item posted by the same person, even if raffles have been ""Won"" with that item **Mathematical stuff, and screenshots of the scam in action (Thank you Lion for helping here.)** [URL"

This doesn't really address high sec wars and HQs. War HQs should adhere to NS or WH rules. Sure it's 1+1+4.5 now, but that's still 6.5 out of 7 days, there's no point in attempting to kill a structure to end a war. You should be able to accomplish your objective (ending the war) in the first half of the 7 day duration. 2. The 30 days the change a vulnerability window essentially eliminates structure sales. If this is going to change to 30 days, there should be a mechanic where a corporation sets their default window. When a structure is transferred it should automatically change to the default window. In order to avoid abuse, the default window can only be changed once every 30 days."
16,vulnerability,Eve,Blackout Suggestion,0,dejwbb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dejwbb/blackout_suggestion/,2019-10-08 01:05:58,"Hi, I believe that I may offer a nice suggestion to bring Blackout back. I dont think it was a smart idea or implemented correctly. I am writing this on a phone so please disregard any grammar or spelling mistakes. Nullsec alliances thrive off Intel. Intel, being so valuable, shouldn't be free. CONCORD should either start charging alliances to run the Fluid Routers which provide FTL Communications in systems. Or have it be a system upgrade/structure like Cyno Beacons and Cyno Inhibitors that can be anchored anywhere. The fuel would be cold hard PLEX. I haven't thought of a fair rate of fuel usage. These structures would have a high hitpoint count and follow vulnerability windows like most structures. And only once destroyed not offer the FTL effect. With implementation, CONCORD should sell the blueprint for Fluid Routers in their LP store. Then CCP, under the guise of CONCORD give players a deadline for which the CONCORD fluid routes go offline. Once offline they will be visible to other players and destroyed for a small pile of PLEX or components needed to build their own (if they haven't already) and the potential to drop a CONCORD Fouid Router BPC which is a variation that cannot be detected by D-Scan and VERY hard to be probed. Thanks for taking the time to read, I know that there is a possibility this take has been voice here already and may leave me with a karma hit but I just thought I'd get it off my mind. o7 Fly Safe Abooove"
17,vulnerability,Eve,Drunken Citadel Ramblings,0,dgqcqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/dgqcqd/drunken_citadel_ramblings/,2019-10-12 15:24:58,"So to be fair I am going to preface this with the fact some napkin math was done and no one was sober when this idea came about. The crazy part was the amount of people who actually thought this was a good idea so here it goes. Astrahus, Fortizar, and Keepstars now have new restrictions: Keepstar: Limit of two per region Fortizar: Limit of one per constellation Astrahus: Limit one per system Industrial citadels do not adhere to these restrictions, however aside from the Sotiyo and Tatara no other industrial citadels provide a tether mechanic as this is now reserved for strategic assets. Tethering on 40 different structures in a single system needs to die. **Combat** Strategic structures can no longer be attacked unless the IHUB in the system is destroyed. Once an IHUB is destroyed no one may place a new one for 7 days from the time of destruction New item tokens which are redeemed from Upwell are used to take control of strategic assets. Basically when a structure gets destroyed the alliance who placed the token during the first reinforcement timer (Must be deposited before the structure hits 75% shields) gets to choose the location of the replacement structure. (How it calculates who gets to place the new structure wasn't exactly flushed out at this point) For example if a Keepstar is destroyed then the attacking alliance may choose any system within the region for the new Keepstar as long as either they control the IHUB or no IHUB is present in the system. If a system with no IHUB is chosen then the Keepstar will be in a vulnerable state upon deployment. The vulnerability timer during the anchoring process is removed. This process does mean there is a considerable investment to attack structures, however upon success you are guaranteed a foothold in the region. This will also reduce total structure spam due to the limit restrictions. Groups that need multiple structures for things like renters may utilize personal industrial citadels, however the strategic assets will most likely be in control of landlords. This will also self police capitol ratting since structures they can dock in are now much more restricted. Structure tokens are obtained by turning in the corresponding structure for the same token. This process cannot be reversed. If a constellation has no IHUB or a friendly IHUB and no other Fortizar is present any entity may anchor a Fortizar with the normal method in game today. The same goes for other restricted structures. This means an initial invasion must hit various IHUBs and will be subcap focused via entosis. Sure, caps can play a role here, but most of the time they don't. This also means more defense for strategic assets because if you enemy wins they now have a anchored Fortizar or whatever they hit in your backyard. Invasion points become vital. We didn't really think about this topic much after this before the golden structure maintenance idea happened. **Structure Maintenance** A percentage of all transactions which take place within a structure is now added to a ISK pool for that structure. This includes manufacturing, research, market, clones, and more. Ship insurance is excluded due to abuse possibilities. In the event of destruction this ISK pool is paid out to the corporation wallet with the most damage done during the final timer. This makes it lucrative for entities to come hit market hubs, industrial hubs, etc. PVP and get paid for it point blank. Using a data analyzer on a structure will reveal the current ISK pool for said structure. Unanchoring a structure causes no payout so it might be better to blow it up yourself depending on what it is. Keepstar market been around a while and you got invaded? Tough decision suddenly. The longer something lucrative is around the more of a target is becomes. There were a few other ideas tossed around, but nothing that really made me want to post about it. Let me know what you think. Would love some feedback which will give us something to talk about on the next drunken roam night! For now good hunting everyone o7"

Nevertheless, I'd like to keep the dream alive that one day CCP will give FW some love. Here are a few suggestions to improve FW using stuff CCP has already developed for other parts of the game that could be implemented using existing resources. Literally just copy / paste this stuff into FW (yes I know it isn't \*that\* simple). 1) Delete FW agent missions; replace with Agency Events FW missions are broken and almost everyone hates them. Delete the agents. Make recurring weekly Agency Events within FW that work just like the previous Agency evens where completing objectives awarded points towards unlocking rewards. Make each level of plex (novice, small, medium, large) reward 10, 15, 20, 30 points and reward extra LP / ship hulls / modules at 50, 100, 200 etc. Play with the numbers, figure it out. This would get people logging in regularly and give them concrete personal goals. Bonus: reward extra points for PVP kills. Counterpoint: If you are absolutely positively unwilling to delete missions for whatever reason, just do the agency event thing anyway. Seriously, even just that would be a huge improvement / incentive. 2) Turn FW iHubs into FW FOBs. iHubs are boring. They dont even blow up when you bash them to flip a system. Keep all the existing plexing and vulnerability mechanics, turn the iHubs into FW FOBs that work exactly the same way but looks and feels cooler. Give it a faction navy skin, have it blow up when you bash them, and boost the LP reward to not be worthless. Have it generate a kill mail. Simple, easy, but would add more fun and feel like a more worthy accomplishment. Bonus: Have it drop some kind of worthless FW vanity item from the opposing faction that we can stockpile for bragging rights / lulz. 3) Bring back gate sliding. This got broken when plex gates got fixed to disallow warp core stabs. Do what you did with ventures and let them in, but not capture the plex, and let us go back to sliding gates. What are your simple suggestions to improve FW with existing stuff they already have in the game?"

But all Sundays at 19:00 Eve it would become vulnerable you kill it you get all that isk, ore and LP. It should have 100 mil hp 90% resists and should decrease proportionally to the amount of loot it would drop at 1/6 of a DTU it should rest at 20%. For every 1/60 of a DTU it should have an additional vulnerability hour up to 72 hours. If there is more than one CONCORD Observatory in the region it will collect (amount)/n where n is the number of CONCORD Observatories in a region. This would make wars super important and profitable, and cause huge explosions of conflict while making it seriously hard to hurt smaller Alliances by killing their CONCORD Observatory and making juicy targets need to be defended.

21,vulnerability,Eve,Next major change: Remove asset safety from Null sec. Loot drops.,0,cdnl9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/cdnl9u/next_major_change_remove_asset_safety_from_null/,2019-07-16 07:15:49,"tldr; citadels should drop loot instead of asset safety in null sec giving null entities larger incentive to defend and attack structures. &amp;#x200B; Blackout has been a big success. This was because it brought back the danger of null sec. Lets keep this moving and implement another WH type mechanic. Loot drops during citadel destruction in null sec. A players loot is not longer safe in null when operating out of player dropped structures. Since citadels are currently OP with god mode tethers, reps, DD's, plus the rumors of a mooring option that makes you unbumpable. They should have a major vulnerability when operating out of one in that your loot is no longer safe. Asset safety in null is a cheese mode ""tax"" given to CCP that allows low punishment to a structures owner for not showing up to defend it and no reward for those who attack it. Really the only negative effect of losing citadels these days is the strategic effect and even then you just plop another down quickly and you're off again. This mechanic could operate similarly to how WH's and ships do. Some of the items are destroyed and others are dropped when killed. This would increase motivations for groups to combat citadel spam and give line members rewards for showing up to the absolute mind numb structure bashes that are undefended structures. This also would create motivation or incentive for defenders to actually show up to a structure timer as they are not just losing a structure that costs less than the fleet to defend it would cost. Some issues would be entire super fleets/subcap fleets getting head shot. This would be a cruddy mechanic. Perhaps only manual asset safety would work. It might need some tweaking. But I think there is a way to get around this. Lore wise its easy as you can make up how the logistics network is again under large amounts of pressure and it's just to dangerous to send npc freighting ships to safely remove these assets from null."

This would be a mechanics issue to resolve or think about to prevent work arounds). &amp;nbsp; Only one citadel per region can/must be selected as a region capital. (again, per alliance? another mechanics issue). &amp;nbsp; How does it work? &amp;nbsp; If the region capital is destroyed, all system capitals lose their shield timer and the armor timer becomes 24h vulnerability. A new region capital may can be selected after 7 days. If no new citadel is selected, a random structure will be assigned capital status in the home/capital system of the alliance. &amp;nbsp; If the system capital is destroyed, all citadels in the same system lose their shield timer and the armor timer becomes 24h vulnerability. A new system capital may can be selected after 7 days. If no new citadel is selected, a random structure will be assigned capital status in that system. &amp;nbsp; If both the regional and system capital are destroyed at the same time, all structures in that system lose both the shield and armor time and the structure goes directly to hull timer and normal vulnerability window. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This would allow for a lot of structures to be killed quicker as well as creating some very make or break mandatory show up to fight battles. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; So, aside from trying to design it to prevent people from side stepping it by putting citadels in a dozen different alliances, what other downsides would there be for this? &amp;nbsp; Ideas?"

Also, some of these are inherently very trollish and said tongue in cheek (humor). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1. Escalating citadel upkeep costs based on number in system. EVERY citadel in system impacted. Includes price of clones (minimum), fuel block consumption etc. &amp;nbsp; 2. Cap the number of buy and sell orders in a market based on the size of the station. 5k for an astra up to 100k for a keepstar. Somewhere in between for npc stations. &amp;nbsp; 3. Lock buy or sell orders from being modified more than once every 1-6 hours. &amp;nbsp; 4. Story line that allows mechanic to assault low and high sec and turn them into null sec. &amp;nbsp; 5. Remove all forms of in and out of game intel or reduce them to 24 hour refresh. &amp;nbsp; 6. Refresh Zkill / Dotlan on a weekly basis, almost like other games with weekly bracket releases. &amp;nbsp; 7. Introduce resource scarcity/resource regeneration mechanic capping the amount of players a region can support to around 1000-2000 at most. Including high security space. &amp;nbsp; 8. Introduce mechanic to hold a wormhole open for an invasion force. &amp;nbsp; 9. Change structure timers to at most 5 days from start to finish for any structure. Change armor timer to 8 hour vulnerability and hull to 4 hour vulnerability. &amp;nbsp; 10. Drop asset safety to 50 % and the rest drops as loot. Let RNG decide who gets what. &amp;nbsp; 11. Remove tether. Just give citadels normal structure mechanics. &amp;nbsp; 12. Change Concord reaction time to include a random +/- 0 % to 1000 % reaction speed. Maybe the gank will go really well, maybe the fuzz will shut you down. &amp;nbsp; 13. Your war HQ gets destroyed? All wars end immediately and your corporation and the alliance you are a part of is on mandatory cease fire for 30 days. You better show up to fight. &amp;nbsp; 14. Change cynos to have a chance for a random exit vector. 1 % to land somewhere random in system. 1-10 % chance to land within 100-1000km of target. Skills to reduce drift down to 10-100km of target. Get rekt jump freighters. &amp;nbsp; 15. Change covery cynos to have double the percentage of going wrong and spooky space dunking you. &amp;nbsp; 16. Add cynos to wormholes, jumping through any neighboring system linked via a current open wormhole. Mass limitations apply. &amp;nbsp; 17. Add permanent damage to the hull when you burn a module out to 100 %. Module hp was 40 and you burned it out? -40hp on your hull permanently. &amp;nbsp; 18. Corpse collector mechanic! If you have the corpse of the person you are shooting, gain +10 % damage! Have to consume the corpse as a drug. &amp;nbsp; 19. Minimum buy/sell order price change is 1 % of your original posted price. No more 0.01isk. &amp;nbsp; 20. Maximum cloak time / fuel usage mechanic introduced. Removal permanent safety feature."
24,vulnerability,Eve,Idea to Reduce Structure Spam,0,c693ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c693ur/idea_to_reduce_structure_spam/,2019-06-28 04:29:30,"A lot of players have brought up the topic of structure spam with the new Upwell structures as being a huge problem in New Eden. Several ideas have been put forward for how to discourage structure spam but I don't believe I've seen the one I'm suggesting put forward. What if multiple structures of a particular type incur penalties for having them in the same system? &amp;#x200B; For instance: Structures receive bonuses based on the type of structure. What if those bonuses were reduced for every additional structure of that type in the same system? There could also be additional penalties such as increased vulnerability windows. The penalties could also scale with structure size so that smaller structures wouldn't incur as high of a penalty as larger structures. Obviously the details would need to be ironed out so that it is balanced, but I think it could be a way to discourage dropping 30 structures in a single system."
25,vulnerability,Eve,A Mechanical Analysis of the Drifter Invasion Event,443,c6z1ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c6z1ft/a_mechanical_analysis_of_the_drifter_invasion/,2019-06-29 23:37:24,"Initial reports are always full of conjecture and hyperbole. My reaction was no different. I saw a drifter fleet reinforce a Horde jumpgate, and show up a few hours later to kill it. I assumed CCP had set eve ablaze, but now that this week of the event is understood, lets look at what it actually is, broken down from a mechanics perspective. Obviously I dont have perfect data for the whole of nullsec, but Ive compiled 5-6 regions worth of reports and I think theyre good enough as a baseline for rudimentary analysis. Mechanics: * Drifters pick up to three random systems in a region, and each day over a period of 4-12 hours spawn fleets of drifters. ADM, Geography, Jumps, nor any other commonly measured activity metric appears to affect the spawn system chosen, but it does seem to somewhat center time around local activity or vuln windows. * Drifter fleets will pick a warpable object at random in the system and warp to it, If its a gate it will engage anyone there, if nothing is on the grid it picks a new target. Targets do not have to be the sov holder of a system, biggest, smallest, or any particular power state to be selected. They also dont have to be player owned. * If they land on a player owned structure, drifter fleets will engage the structures until reinforcement, and then will pick another target at random. They will continue to reinforce structures in the same system by bouncing to objects at random until theyre dealt with. * Drifter fleet notifications come through the same way player ones do, along with the NPC entity name that did the initial shooting. * Drifters ignore structure damage caps * Drifter fleets do not show up intentionally for their own timers, but it is possible that they can spawn in the same system the next day, following the initial rules. If they happen across a citadel during its very limited timer vulnerability window (although very unlikely), they will shoot it. More on this later. * Drifter fleets appear to have their own limited loot tables, with all the valuable stuff from their normal spawn table removed. * Drifter fleets appear to follow their normal spawn counterparts in regards to stats, which is ~1300dps of omni damage, frigate tracking, 150km range. They also appear to move at the same speed as their normal spawn counterparts. * They do not appear to have the same DD mechanics as their normal spawn counterparts So how have people responded to them? Pumping out carrier DPS at frigate tracking, frigate speed, and battleship range, The drifters outclass any subcaps in eve. T2/T3 cruiser fleets can hold against them in sufficiently large numbers, but the drifters shift primaries efficiently enough to make trades common and unfavorable, especially when they target support or logi ships. The two major strategies for combating them among the largest nullsec entities are supercarrier/structure bombs, or fleets of disposable, long range destroyers (corms for example). Drifter fleets attacked with the above mechanics only take a few minutes to destroy once you are on grid. As it turns out theyre not actually a threat to anyones structures. CCP pussed out on that one. They dont target low power cit spam, they dont show up to timers on purpose, the only things they will realistically kill will be jump gates that they can pop before anyone with structure manager logs in and re-onlines them. (Hey CCP how about a revamp on that one yeah?) The chances that they respawn in the correct system at the correct time for a structures fifteen minute vulnerability, and select the correct warp point, is unbelievably low As far as I can tell, in legacy, it has happened a grand total of zero times. Sorry guys, nothing is burning this week. Maybe next week theyll release something of substance and youll get more than content creator investment hours traded for a dog and pony show. But what about content? This is forcing everyone to feet up and undock right? Isnt that a good thing? Traditional PVE mechanics fuel PVP by forcing players to be undocked and in space for extended periods of time. Dont get me wrong, I have about a thousand things to say about the current state of VNI and Rorq PVE, but thats not what this post is about. The one thing I will say, is that any mechanic that encourages a player to be tethered to a grid where spontaneous content can happen is a good thing, but that doesnt happen here either. Even if a hostile entity gets our attack notifications, weve already dropped a super, dispatched a citadel gunner, or formed a fleet and killed the drifters long before a hostile can get more than a bridge and 5 jumps from staging. And thats assuming theyre paying attention to the intel at least as well as their neighbors are. Nobody is on grid long enough to generate a fight, and even if they were, theyre on fully gunned citadel grids, within weapons range. Not a good place to take a fight if you dont want to feed. The traditional risk averse nullsec PVP FC wont take that fight, even if they could get there in time, and I dont blame them. Welping with a chance at a kill can be a lot of fun, welping to a fort trying to kill a supercarrier has a very low chance of resulting in anyones content but theirs. Thats a problem with citadel design, not this event. Eve needs a good snowglobe shaking; this isnt it. The end result, is an already solved, rewardless, mandatory pve event (which poses no actual threat) that distracts people from things that can actually generate content. Good job CCP, better luck next wednesday."

27,vulnerability,Eve,Necessities &amp; Possibilities Pt 1: What Needs to Change,242,c92jc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c92jc4/necessities_possibilities_pt_1_what_needs_to/,2019-07-04 23:22:11," Hi there. My name is Michael Wilmore. Ive been in Higher Than Everest \[P3AK\] for 2 years, and before that Horde Vanguard. \[TRYHD\]. I like to smellgong and touch nodes, and write big long essays about what I think. This is one of those. In this paragraph orgy, I want to do a couple of things: * outline in brief the high-level changes I think CCP need to make in the next 6-12 months * go into detail about what those changes would enable and the various synergies between them * talk briefly about the Drifter event, and why its the wrong path even if CCPs heart is in the right place Thats as much as youre going to get by way of a tl;dr. &amp;#x200B; **Part 1: Fix Structure and Sov grind IMMEDIATELY** Upwell 2.0 and the first (!) iteration on aegis sov were both almost a year and a half ago. Whilst the iteration on entosis nodes and remote reps were broadly well-received, they were still relatively particular changes and didnt address the timer system that has existed since 2015 (!). On the other hand, Upwell 2.0 was [widely panned before arrival](URL and viewed a step backwards, and to date nothing has been done to address those concerns. In the meantime though, weve had yet more feature creep in the form of buffed jammers and fatigueless jump gates. The result has been a null (and wider) landscape thats simultaneously more static, grindy, and blobby than ever before. I honestly think that before doing any other balance or development work, CCP needs to address sov and structure mechanics, especially the latter as it affects all of New Eden. To that end Ive created a simple one-pager document of the changes I think need to be made in the immediate future: [Defibrillator: A Three Part Plan for Eve Online](URL &amp;#x200B; Ill go into more detail on this in the next section, but in short they are a set of suggestions that involve minor changes to existing attributes/code or the return of some small amount of previously existing attributes/code. In other words, [its just numbers](URL \- none of this should be hard to do in terms of workload. It just requires CCP to commit to a more risky vision of New Eden. I put it in a simple, one-pager format because I wanted to make it easy to digest. But the format doesnt really get across the many implications of these changes. Thats what I want to go into next. **Part 2: Big Things Have Small Beginnings (warning: many words)** Here I want to go into detail about why I think the changes in the above document would be good, and what kind of synergistic results might follow: 1) Upwell 3.0 &amp;#x200B; * *i. Reinforcement timers reduced; 2 for high power, and single (kill) timer for low-power, across all upwell structures in lowsec and nullsec. Hisec should retain an armor timer 24h after the initial reinforcement, and otherwise function identically.* Pretty obvious: the actual structure grind, irrespective of any other changes, would be reduced by a 33-50% outside of hisec. I can understand why CCP might want empire space to be more forgiving and require 3 timers, but there is no reason to do so in nullsec or lowsec, which are supposed to be high-risk, high-reward environments. Low-power structures in particular need to be 1-shot jobs, just like unstronted POSs. If youre in nullsec or lowsec or a wormhole, and your stuff isnt fueled, it should be maximally vulnerable. Maybe in hisec you might want it to be 2 timers rather than one (and down from 3), but in risky space structure negligence should have dramatic costs. &amp;#x200B; * ii. *Defender chooses the timezone of the exit, but the day is determined by the attacker. The specific timer is determined by the time of attack; if within the timezone window then the timers will be at that exact time. If the initial reinforcement takes place outside that window, the final timer will be at the limit of the exit window closest to the time the initial attack took place.* The most important point here is that by putting the day of the timer in the attackers control, you permit cross-timezone pvp interaction. The attackers can hit the astra in their own TZ during the week, creating a weekend timer in the defenders TZ. They can then get up early or stay up late to meet their foe at a time of their enemys choosing. Theres nothing wrong with 4am timers if thats when the structure owners actually play the game, but driven pvp entities should at least have the option of going hardcore at the weekend and alarm-clocking. There are other benefits too - for one thing, progress in your war isnt limited to a single day a week. There is nothing worse than defeating an enemy completely, and then being unable to make rapid progress because all their structures exit at the same time, on the same day, once a week. Increasing the influence attackers have over timers will allow for wars to proceed at a much more interesting pace than currently (e.g. see an near-uncontested Imperium struggling to get through tribute in a month, or PL and TAPIs back to back grinds through Provi). Finally, a word on controlling the exit time: random roll timers are stupid. Its extremely frustrating to hit a structure of one end of its vulnerability window only to have it exit at the other. Why have this luck-based timer roll nonsense? Let the time of the attack influence the position of the timer within the vulnerability window. A 4-hour variance in the timer is MASSIVE, its silly to have it depend on chance. &amp;#x200B; * *iii. The distance between the initial reinforcement and the final timer will depend on the structure size. 1 day for FLEX structures, 2 days for medium structures (same as POSs), 3 days for large structures, and 5 days for XL structures.* Ive never really understood why Upwell structures have no size distinctions with respect to their timers. Keepstars and Fortizars are obviously of greater functional, financial and strategic interest than an Astrahus. Even in nullsec or lowsec, I can see why you might want a few days to rally allies in defence of your 250b supercapital staging structure. But Astrahus and Fortizar timers should really be local, short-term content, not something you batphone the whole world for 6 days ahead of the hull timer. A 2 day ref-to-kill cycle for an astra is no different to what we had with outposts or POSs, and  days for forts and keeps respectively still represents a significant buff on what existed previously. The current 9-day (!) cycles are just ridiculous. &amp;#x200B; * *iv. Damage cap increased so that all timers take a maximum of 15 minutes at cap (same as the repair timer, equivalent to 3 siege cycles).* Remember back when we just had POSs, and dreads were the weapon of choice, and youd spend 6 siege cycles on every timer? Yeah, me neither, because 6 siege cycles meant you hadnt brought enough dreads. It would simply be too long to hang around risking your stuff. But now, thats the mandatory amount of time you have to spend on grid. I can understand where CCP were coming from with damage caps, and I can see how removing them and going back to reps etc would be difficult and more problematic than people admit. But I dont see why everything has to take so much longer on average. This spring me and a handful of other guys reinforced a low-power Sotiyo in about 15 minutes with some supers. Nobody was complaining about damage cap because it was just fundamentally a reasonable amount of time. At damage cap, a low-power engineering complex currently takes just 8 minutes to reinforce. Does anyone really hate damage cap on those timers? The biggest issue with damage caps isnt that they exist, but that they are generally set far too low. It shouldnt take more than 15 minutes to finish a timer at cap. &amp;#x200B; * *v. Standup armor plates removed from the game.* Ahahaha, speak of the fucking devil. Whoever thought these were a good idea, that an option to INCREASE the amount of time it takes to kill citadels at damage cap was needed, obviously does not play that part of the game. We need fewer timers, not longer ones - delete these shitty things. &amp;#x200B; * *vi. Upwell structures will only be able to use their weapons once in armor or a deep % of shield on the initial reinforcement, and during the final timer.* Yeah yeah yeah, POS guns were on all the time, muh feature parity! POSs didnt have all the functionality of the completely defenceless outposts that people used to actually live in. Citadels do need to be able to defend themselves, but not all the time - they are already far safer than outposts by virtue of tether. We know this is possible because they had weapons limitations outside of their vulnerability windows in Upwell 1.0, so its definitely possible to code. A lot more roaming and spontaneous content would be possible if you could exist on the same grid as a citadel without getting annihilated by it. One concern would be the defence of FLEX structures. Perhaps it would be possible to link the availability of citadel defences to the status of other Upwell structures within 500km or so; then again a lot of people think the current state of jammers on citadels is borderline broken. Perhaps a compromise is needed where only ewar is available day-round. At any rate I think itd be a lot more fun if spaceships could fight each other on Upwell grids, rather than all kinds of content being *de facto* reduced to whether or not you can tank a citadel. &amp;#x200B; * *vii. Entosis of station/citadel services to return as a mechanic.* During WWB, I was in Pandemic Horde. After we captured O1Y-ED station and began staging there, Goons (and Boat in particular) would CONSTANTLY harass our undock and station services. They would come in a fleet, entosis the clone bay, and if it got turned off all the beans would end up back in hisec if they got podded. In reality the stakes were pretty limited, but it was a massive inconvenience, and as a result a massive incentive to undock and fight them. There were big dunks and big feeds, but it was a near-guaranteed way to provoke a response from us. Later when I had joined P3AK in The-Culture, we had great fun provoking fights from the locals through this mechanic. We would poke the services, they would undock, and there would be a fight. Sometimes theyd just gank our entosis, sometimes wed gank theirs when they tried to re-online the cloning. It was a great mechanic that provided good back-and-forth skirmishing. Contrast with [what happened once Horde onlined our fort in O1Y](URL This video is pretty funny in a way, but it only happened because Boat didnt understand the range and power of the Fortizar. Now that everyone does, this kind of content is basically dead. I think thats a tremendous shame, and would love to see Upwell structure services linked to the entosis module again. One thing to note is that this is only possible or worth doing if Upwell structures cannot use their defences all the time. Otherwise the structure would simply force the entosis ship off. By removing the weapons, and creating a point of interaction, you allow spontaneous, low-stakes fights to occur. It would give people an actual reason to roam to someone elses staging beyond hoping that theyll undock. And because low-power structures are kill shots and full-power structures only have 2 timers, you dont have to link it to an active service module. Fuel in the bay? Its full power. No fuel? Its low power. Service modules are a point of interaction instead of an abstract cost. And how about moon goo? How much easier do you think it would be to get a response if entosising the drill service on an athanor could pause the chunk? Likewise for builds in engineering complexes. I actually think this was a huge missed opportunity with Upwell structures, and a form of content they could have provided that was never possible with POSs. &amp;#x200B; * *viii. Introduction of a less profitable passive rig for refineries.* I think that modest passive income should be possible via Refineries, so that small-scale pvp playstyles can be supported. I realise that there is some concern about this devaluing the isk/hour of active moon-mining, but I think it should be pretty easy to come up with a ratio that wont glut the market into oblivion. You could also limit what ores the passive and active rigs can extract, so that some ores are produced exclusively by one or the other. In any event, there needs to be some kind of compromise here, because the current price of moon goo is mostly a symptom of not a lot of people wanting to actively mine moons. &amp;#x200B; * *ix. Jump fatigue added back to jump gates.* Another example of outrageous feature creep. Was anyone actually asking for this? Removing fatigue means removing geography, and as a result almost every significant fight is a blobfest. When P3AK was in skill urself (rip), we used to jaunt from MTO on the border with Venal to Detorid on the border with Immensea, in the space of about 15-20 minutes. Barra would just laugh about how broken it was; it was apparent to every one of us that we shouldnt be able to regularly and reliably traverse a quarter of the map in 15 minutes. The combination of fatigueless jump gates and their ACLs means that the position of your staging matters less and less the more people you blue or NIP. It also means that harrassment and guerilla stagings by small groups are basically a dead playstyle. Theres no point deploying a small group to the far side of your enemys forward staging when its just 3 fatigueless jumpgates away. Instead of risky, behind-the-lines logistics being rewarded with opportunities, its just hard for you and never for the person living there. Oh, and can we please have tackle prevent jumping like it used to? Theyre not regular star gates - they have access lists. Jumping through one blind should have consequences, rather than being able to crash gate knowing the baddies cant follow you through. Stop with the feature creep. &amp;#x200B; * *x. Putting it all Together: An Example* *Its Tuesday evening, and* [*you and the boys*](URL *are bored. So you get in a few smallgang ships with an alt in a toaster, and head over to the staging system of the nearby blobs local pet alliance. These clowns are a good bit bigger than you, but its off-tz for them and they dont have a very big pvpness either. They do have a fort though, so you put the toaster on it and start winding up on the clone services. They undock ewar ships to annoy you, but the griffins die easily enough before the local Standing Fleet Hero feeds his Falcon. This seems to get him mad, because a few minutes later he undocks a section of Caracals to force you off. The toaster dies, but you kite your way to 4 or 5 kills and a 500m pod, ecks dee made you form isk positive. The kind of half-assed response gets you thinking though. You ping for a fleet the following evening at the same time.* *This time you bring a small Leshak fleet with remote reps and plenty of Guardians. Youre not quite at the new damage cap but it still only takes you 20 minutes; halfway through shield the fort guns come online, but you can tank it no problem and they dont have the numbers at this time of day to force you off. As you hit it a good 6 hours before their vuln window it comes out at 2am on Saturday for you, early Sunday evening for them. Not ideal, but you have nothing to do on Sunday so time to old-school it!* *The nearby blob are currently staged on the other side of their space, and they have a biggish timer the same evening so they cant afford to stack fatigue. The locals still outnumber you though, but there are some matching-tz npc nullsec dudes youre on good terms with who dont like them either. Its their staging fort so you know youll get a fight, even if they cant rustle up any big batphones. Their cap fleet has evaccd to a different fort, but theyre unlikely to use caps due to the ranges into NPC space.* *On the night you bring a girthy Ishtar fleet and your allies are in some weird sniper BC boosh comp. The locals have a Ferox fleet and a tackle-wing from a batphone who didnt want to come all that way in anything bigger. The fight is really fun, the feroxes feed a lot despite being bigger, but the tackle wing is very persistent in hounding the boosh fleet, and in the end the fort repairs despite the attackers pretty much winning the field. Nobody really cares though, it was a nice 300 man fight on a Saturday night, and everyone got some low-scale, high-stakes content.* &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; I dont want this example to sound overly patronising, my intention is just to show how these tweaks taken together would change the pace, scale, and scope of citadel warfare dramatically. Travel times/accessibility are inextricably linked with the scale of fights, as is the time between reinforcement and final timer. The longer the build-up, the easier it is to get there, the more people will come. The argument often goes that with a declining player base, the game needs to be easier to travel. What this ignores is that player numbers are affected as much by available playstyles as anything else. When you turn all structure-warfare into giant blobtastic fights, people who arent interested in that stop playing. Very few people actually enjoy these 2000-4000 character tidi fests, yet 9-day timers and fatigueless jump gates encourage exactly that. Meanwhile, if you want to have small-scale fights there is very little way to provoke it at the moment. Even the potential for identifying possible targets is barely there, because roaming and poking in off timezones is basically impossible. You can just be ignored until the armor timer. The fact that even having discovered their vulnerability window, you are rolling the dice on the actual timer (with a 4 hour potential spread) is even more discouraging. All of which means these timers just never get made in the first place because at the end of the day, who can be bothered? I am firmly of the opinion that ALL of these changes need to take place if Upwell structures are to become an interesting or engaging content driver. Right now they are just a great big obstacle you have to grind through. &amp;#x200B; 2) Aegis 3.0 &amp;#x200B; * *i. Advantages conferred by ADMs to be reduced: an ihub at ADM 6 should take 30 minutes to reinforce uninterrupted. The minimum time should remain the same. The minimum vulnerability window should also be extended to allow for cross-tz fights.* The fact that 4 years on it still takes an hour to reinforce an ADM 6 ihub uncontested blows my mind. Does anyone actually think this is a reasonable *minimum* amount of time to just *create* a timer??? This is perhaps the epitome of grind as defence - your enemy gets 45 minutes to form and arrive *in their own space*, which you have already travelled to. 30 minutes is plenty of time for what is ultimately just creating a timer. The current vulnerability windows are also too short - why do citadels have a 4 hour vulnerability window, but ADM 6 ihubs only have a 3 hour window? This number feels picked at random, but I think the minimum window should be at least 4 hours long, and probably 6. Cross-TZ interaction is a GOOD thing, the edges of your timezone should be dangerous and interesting. &amp;#x200B; * ii. *Attacker determines the exact timer within the vuln window as with upwell structures.* Ive already been through this with regard to Upwell structures: random timers suck. What is the point of low ADMs producing wide vulnerability windows if the timer is completely random? An ADM 1 ihub has an 18 hour spread. The timer should come out from when you started reffing. This is easily one of the most infuriating and pointless mechanics in Aegis sov. &amp;#x200B; * *iii. TCU functionality rolled into the ihub and the structure removed from the game.* Speaking of pointless mechanics, can we get rid of TCUs please? They do almost nothing at the moment, and there is no reason for them to exist. Its just the duplication of sov grind for no reason. &amp;#x200B; * *iv. Continued nerfs to the respawn time and number of anoms provided by ihub upgrades.* I think its kind of wild that CCP was so willing to go full bananas with the Drifter event, but has been so conservative with ihub upgrades and anom numbers/respawn time. If you want people to spread out, the carrot works better than the stick. High-end sov still supports way too many people. Keep or buff the bonused ticks and loot drops if you want, but reduce the actual number of anoms as well as the respawn time. Fully upgraded sov should not have like, 5 sanctums and a gorillion havens and hubs. Nerf ihubs by half and you will pretty much solve the oppressiveness of supercap umbrellas overnight. &amp;#x200B; 4) Umbrella Mechanics &amp;#x200B; Having said that, there are some little tweaks to the projection meta that would help in combination with the above: * *i. Buff resists and range of cyno inhibs - should be survivable and affect the entire grid.* I really dont think this deployable is anywhere near as powerful as it should be. Getting one of these things down should be a triumph or disaster depending on your point of view. Making them tougher and more powerful would dramatically change how tackling caps can play out. &amp;#x200B; * *ii. Give Black ops battleships a small SMB similar to the Nestor. Maybe a covops cloak.* At this stage its pretty safe to say that the capital genie is out of the bottle, and its not going back in. One of the biggest losers of capital proliferation has been the Black Ops battleship. Once a fearsome means of force projection, theyre now capital fodder and largely eclipsed by the far more versatile and survivable covert T3Cs. Ive heard a lot of suggestions for blops, some of which seem a little wacky, some of which seem broken. But I think some small, obvious changes could make them a lot more relevant. Giving them a Ship Maintenance Bay would allow them to really augment the projection and power of T3Cs. Switching between travel fits and combat fits when and where appropriate would allow for much more forceful fleet use of covert bridges, without adding anything game-breaking or oppressive. On the other end of the scale, in the current landscape it seems ridiculous that the high-sp, high-cost blops cannot use a covert ops cloak. That simple, obvious change would make black ops way more viable for roaming, wormhole combat, and just generally worth using, without making them overpowered in a fleet context. &amp;#x200B; * *iii. Do NOT nerf the loki; if anything buff the other 3 T3Cs.* When you read the CSM minutes, they often seem to raise the issue of the Loki being much better than the other T3Cs. This usually elicits a response from CCP Fozzie to the effect that they need to nerf its fitting. Perhaps I am wrong, but that seems to completely miss the point: the problem isnt that the Loki is too strong, its that the other T3Cs are now kind of garbage outside of some very niche situations. Its not as though all anybody is flying are Lokis, like Ishtar or Svipul online. The meta is decidedly HACs, with battleships the main counter (other than, you know, other HACs). People do use Loki fleets sometimes, but the reason they dont use the other T3Cs is because they are rubbish. The Tengu is like a Loki but with a worse turret type and a less relevant ewar bonus. The Legion is good for blops ganks but is otherwise very ordinary, and the Proteus is really good at being slow and having crap fitting room. With the exception of the Tengu (which has other niches by way of compensation), they all make decent solo cloaky hunters, or with the exception of the Proteus (uhhhh, Guristas 10/10s I guess???), smallgang ships. But the fact that there are some viable fleet fits for the Loki is simply not a problem. What sucks is that there arent for any of the others. &amp;#x200B; * *iv. More, stronger tackle in anoms - e.g. infinite point hic towers etc.* Maybe Im missing something, but isnt this the single most obvious way to nerf botting? Rather than gimping local, making people play captcha online, or bread-and-circuses from CCP San Pellegrino, couldnt CCP just make anoms have stronger tackle? So bots cant just warp out? It doesnt have to be hard to kill or tackle them all the time, just often and long enough that they can get caught without multi-account gymnastics and the patience of Job. Might this have blow-back effects and downsides for hunters and roamers? Sure, but they can plan around that. You cant plan around never being able to catch anything because theyre in warp before you load system. These are the short-term changes CCP need to make to pull this game out of its death spiral. They will make offensive war more enjoyable, more accessible, and more rewarding, and they can all be done without reworking any of the games core structure or sovereignty systems. The only obstacle is CCP; to save Eve Online, they need to commit to a more dangerous, emergent future for nullsec, lowsec, and wormholes. &amp;#x200B; **Part 3: A Game Adrift(ers lol)** I want to write a few words on the Drifter event; so much has been said already, and its clear that among the player base the sentiment boils down to either mandatory pve is shit or finally some chaos in nullsec. The reason both sentiments have such broad support is because they are both right. Mandatory PVE *is* shit, but so is the current structure spam and feature creep that defines the stagnancy of nullsec and lowsec. What CCP needs to do is make killing structures more enjoyable, feasible, and rewarding for *players*, not compensate for people opting out of boring grind by creating more boring grind. Eve is supposed to be about us writing our own stories, fighting our own wars, dying by each others hands. The universe should be the backdrop for our choices, the sand in the box. What we dont need is CCP blasting sand at us until it buries the playerbase. &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; This post is already pretty long, so Im going to end it here - sorry for any spelling or formatting errors, I did my best but I' going outside now so fuck it. &amp;#x200B; In my second post, Im going to outline some ideas I have for events and dynamic gameplay that CCP could implement using existing code, but which would provoke emergent, player-drive content and liven up nullsec, lowsec, and wormholes simultaneously. Look forward to it (or not) in the next couple of days; like and subscribe, favstar in the bio."
28,vulnerability,Eve,Why doesn't truesec affect vulnerability windows?,4,c92yxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/c92yxv/why_doesnt_truesec_affect_vulnerability_windows/,2019-07-05 00:05:01,"I've always been of the opinion that truesec should be more meaningful. Imagine if vulnerability windows were tied to truesec. So in -1.0 they would stay just about where they are, but at 1.0 the windows would be double or triple the size *ceteris paribus*. Or you could go in the opposite direction, but I think that would be kind of lame. But maybe you want timezone tanking in the deepest of null and in high sec, in which case -1.0 and 1.0 both have the same size, converging at 0.0 at double the window size. Obviously the exact numbers are not important at this point and are subject to balance from CCP at some point. &amp;#x200B; This would make regions like the Great Wildlands more true to their name, full of low truesec and therefore deploying and maintaining structures there would be a bit more arduous. Constellations of high truesec become good bases of operations and conveniently these pockets are usually located around regional gates on in pockets, providing two very different kinds of strategic stronghold options."

Just a small thread starting off with a few ideas (maybe good, maybe bad) and hoping more people share their ideas. 1. Region lock moon goo. Each region gets 1 r64/32/16 at a much higher spread than other regions. Say 20 % / 30 % / 45 %. The other types are all at a much lower volume like 5/10/15 %. This would mean that you cannot build all of your t2 items entirely from 1 or 2 regions sufficiently. 2. New structure: Solar Refinery - Acts like a permanent ESS, 1 per system. Placed on the sun. Converts 1 % of ALL m3 mined in that system in a month into the r64 (the refined item, not the bulky rock) of that region. Can be emptied once per month during a set timer, splitting it evenly among all people that mined it like an ESS ready for pick up. Can be emptied (stolen) during it's weekly vulnerability window and take half of what is accumulated. -&gt; Piracy/money/light weight worth a lot. 3. Heavy duty piracy: Like an entosis link called Raiding Party, but used on a structure during vulnerability. Usable on a DST/blockade runner/freighter (LOW SLOT). Requires 15 minutes to work. Result: A randomized loot pool to steal from the structure. (10 % randomly in VALUE randomly pulled from each players assets dumped into a large pool and then 25 % of that displayed. No fit ships.)"
30,vulnerability,Eve,A Sov Mechanic Suggestion...,13,bmyi1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bmyi1i/a_sov_mechanic_suggestion/,2019-05-10 23:47:14,"Current sov mechanics have a vulnerability timer of IHUB based on ADM (Small time window on high ADM, larger time window on low ADM). &amp;#x200B; As soon as the IHUB is re-enforced, the infrastructure supported by the IHUB is shut down while in its re-enforced state (Ie: Jump gates, cyno jammers, etc). Bonuses linked directly to the IHUB such as ratting and mining would remain unaffected, only the structures attached to the IHUB would be temporarily disabled. To be put back online again, the defenders need to win the re-enforcement timer (leaving a window of opportunity for the attackers, and requiring active defense from the defenders instead of using a wall of cyno jammers as a main mean of defense). &amp;#x200B; For example: If you entosis multiple systems in a constellation, this allows the attacker to have an opportunity for mobility within the systems they have re-enforced and prevents the defenders from using jump gates (nerfing them a little since most people are complain they're op in their current state). &amp;#x200B; As an aside, there are certain IHUB upgrades that are required to build Titans/Supers so maybe those could be shut down as well and the builds could be put on pause until the re-enforcement timer is won by the defenders? Leading to fights being fought over the ability to produce Titans/Supers. This is just a side idea but thought it was an interesting one to include. &amp;#x200B; As a result, every first timer is important. This would potentially encourage small skirmishes to be fought (kind of like lowsec faction warfare) over the first timer (when the system is being entosised for the first time) and active defense on subsequent timers. This would allow alliances to install beachheads in a war if the defenders get complacent about the timers and generally be more effective at generating content in times of war. &amp;#x200B; This might be a garbage idea, but hey thought it was worth throwing out there and discussing."
31,vulnerability,Eve,An Actual Improvement to Sov Mechanics instead of just making it easier for the ~blob~,0,bqivjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/bqivjj/an_actual_improvement_to_sov_mechanics_instead_of/,2019-05-20 02:30:07,"So this is somewhat contingent on dealing with the absurd ease with which jump bridges allow massive coalitions to project subcap force, but anyway, here it goes. **This sent of changes is designed to synergize together. Individually, they do relatively little. Together, they make it easier for people to capture unused space, but maintain the difficulty of attacking space that is heavily occupied** 1. Increase the vulnerability window of the Territorial Control Unit, with a max of 24 hour vulnerability to a minimum of 4 hours, instead of the current 18 hours - 3 hours. This makes the TCU more accessible on the edges of timezones outside the one the timer is placed in if they are lower ADM (particularly less than 3). If the space is unused and has a low ADM, an attacking group can expect to eventually get a favorable timer. 2. Institute a penalty on structures when the TCU is controlled by a different group, increasing fuel block usage by 300%. If a structure is sitting in opposing space, it becomes an expensive roach motel if it is fueled for any longer period of time. This does not pose a monetary issue to, say, a group with an offensive staging fortizar or a few structures in enemy space to start projecting force, but does make it very expensive to start spamming structures everywhere or ignoring enemies harassing your TCUs far from home. (but SerQwaez, everyone already just leaves all their structures in low power anyway! Who cares if they go low power faster/more often?) 3. If a structure is in low power, the second timer should be determined by the time of the reinforcement, not the time set by the defender, although the day will continue to be contingent on the defender's choice. If a structure is unfueled or runs out due to increased fuel costs, it can no longer be timezone tanked. However, because the defender is able to select the day they can continue to have some options for improved defense (IE: Setting the timer to a weekend day where they may be able to extend their reach into potential attacking timezones) These changes in concert give an attacking group a clear path to victory in space that is relatively unused by the owners. Start by attacking the TCUs to get timers in your timezone where you can muster numbers for a fight / entosis grind. Without the TCUs, structures enter low power or find themselves in low power anyway, and can be removed from the space much easier. Without structures, the enemy can't safely krab or mine, and the IHUB timer window starts to widen until it too is strikeable from a different timezone. This change does basically nothing to change the defensibility of a system with ADM 5-6, where the timers will continue to be very firmly within a single timezone, all the structures are fueled, and people are around to defend. Don't expect that to change on CCP's level anytime soon. However, we can at the very least start to put pressure on the vast regions of space that are currently barely or completely unused, and allow groups that find themselves ""in the wrong timezone"" from being locked out of space in nullsec artificially."
32,vulnerability,Eve,Structure Repair Idea,1,buzxdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/buzxdr/structure_repair_idea/,2019-05-31 09:10:18,"So a lot of talk about Vulnerability timers has been going around, mostly about timezone tanking. What if after a successful reinforcement, during the armor and hull timer, the citadel bled HP. A slow ticking, something that a single FAX could counter and make decent progress toward repping. What if that 15 minute rep timer was possible with a single fax, basically a rep cap, much like the DPS cap. This would stop timezone tanked structures from just repping their armor automatically and would promote people to be vulnerable to save their structures."
33,vulnerability,Eve,Factional Warfare Short Term and Long Term Proposal,6,b8cdi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/b8cdi7/factional_warfare_short_term_and_long_term/,2019-04-02 12:09:48,"[URL For those who are interested, there has been an ongoing discussion for Factional Warfare changes in this Discord channel URL Seeing that there is a lack of agreement on many ideas, I am going to reiterate some of mine, list those most often mentioned with commentary on their downsides, along with a FW proposal list for quick fixes we can see very soon, their impact and longevity, and important issues that require more time but cannot be ignored. **Neutral presence inside the warzone** Many pilots have proposed heavy penalties to player structures anchored within Factional Warfare space. Non-FW entities are highly reluctant to agree to being inconvenienced by penalties such as increased fuel costs for Upwell structures or cyno inhibition. We remind many that FW space fills a greater part of the most often used lanes between Nullsec and Highsec, with another healthy reminder that there is a vast portion of lowsec that is under-utilized and scarcely inhabited. We remind others that stations continue to exist and that it is Upwell structures themselves that are interfering with the docking restriction which they completely bypass, further deteriorating the importance of geography, markets, and home field advantage. Suggested changes: \*increased fuel costs to neutrals and reduced fuel cost for faction structures corresponding to system ownership. \*No docking on any structures for hostile FW pilots; docking restrictions apply to stations AND Upwell structures Cons to the first is that neutrals will eat a higher cost for structures placed on moons that should, in all respects, be fair game. Cons to the second are that one side will not be able to effectively defend existing structures after a system flip. An asset that could be much more valuable than the system itself. **Front lines and Defensive Plexing** Lowering contested values could probably be done in a better way than the passive non-interaction time sink of dplexing, which doesnt require anything besides hanging in space within 30km of the beacon. You dont even have to have modules on your ship. We keep on attacking things which are used (stabs), and not questioning how senseless the core idea is behind some of these things. My proposal for dplexing is this: For each adjacent system, contestation will be reduced 1% every 24 hours, in addition to the contested value of each incomplete complex opened or unopened (currently 0.7%, with each being cleared from the scanner window); for every hostile adjacent system, contested values of each FW objective increased by 100%. It could be anything, but what it adds is strategy and that is always good. You just have to keep impact on behalf of player activity higher than any kind of bonus that is passive in nature. Require npc clearing for either offensive or defensive plexing. **Complex Timers, impact of variation, and as non-FW hostile ground** Reduce the timers by 25% for all size plex. 7.30 minutes for novice; 11.25 Small; 15 Medium; Large 15m. Scale value of each complex by size to deter the impact small and novice complexes have on a whole: Novice .4%; Small .7%; Medium .9%; Large 1.2%. Making a Large worth up to four novices. Cap or buffer should remain 2.0%. Flag neutral non-FW pilots on acceleration gate as suspect upon gate activation. Since we are likely to not ever get gate sliding back, we might as well piggy back on the warp core stab check and add the non-FW neutral check to it. Lastly, the implementation of Dual-Timers as a better solution to the popular rollbacks. What is essentially two different timers, one for defensive and the other for offensive ticks. Solving the age old problem of bloated timers that encourage abandonment and conceding of some timers. Instead of an unsatisfying tug of war that could have no end in sight, you have a time-frame for every plex that is at best twice the length of time without factoring in the frozen state during pvp activity, giving everyone involved a sense of progression with closure. **Missions and the current tier system** At the moment of writing this, FW missions receive a bonus by tier level towards the amount of LP they reward on completion. They normally would give anywhere from between 25,000 to 30,000 LP a mission. There are around 10 or so level 4 agents which you could visit and request a mission from each one. The mission will expire in 12 hours without suffering any loss to standing. You will lose standing if you reject or quit the mission only, which can sometimes be worth it if you get one you dont like and want a re-roll. This unholy union with the current tier system has elevated missions to a disgusting proportion that can reach payouts for each mission up to 97,500 LP in tier 5, which awards a bonus of +225% over the original amount. These bonuses apply to every LP payment, from completing complexes, destruction of iHubs, to pvp kills. So. We have multiple options in bringing missions into balance. One is to see a rework to the tier system which bring them down to no higher payouts than 30k maximum, regardless of which side is winning or not. The other is to require the agents to request an item from the pilot and in exchange they will grant the FW pilot one mission. CSM Steve Ronuken suggested a token of some type. I ran away with this idea and encourage the agents to require the dog tags from the npcs that are cleared in the very same complexes within the warzone. Each complex rat drops, consistently, a different rank of tag. Tags gains from a should give access to lvl 1 agents; tags from npcs in smalls could grant access to lvl 2 agents; tags from Mediums for lvl 3s and tags from Large rats will grant lvl 4s. Each rat drops a single tag, with the exception of the Large npc, which drops 2 different distinct tags. The result bring that the Large complexes would become more valuable and the outcome will be more fights in a plex which can produce the most interesting and dynamic content. This last change will have the desired affect of reducing the amount of spamming that these missions see in their ability to be chained in succession in a long mission running circuit after visiting all available lvl 4 agents, with tags being a limiting factor. If we have the agents request 5 of the tags that are gained, you allow about one level 4 mission per Large that is completed, which sees anywhere from 5 to 7 spawns. Youre welcome to visit us in the forum to discuss the ideas of, \* complete deletion of mission content (CONS negative impacts on breaking some loyalty store items that rely on the tags that are inside these missions and unanticipated fallout of an unrecoverable tier deterioration for all sides) \*4v4 faction war (CONS to RP allegiances and periodically rare occasions of cross-faction aid support) \*front lines \*no advanced ships in noobie FW complexes (CONS for many pirate and special edition ships that have mostly only been seen being used inside the warzone) \*making the iHub an upgradeable structure \*No upwell structures inside the warzone, replaced with new faction structures that are corp owned and limited to 1 per system that takes the place of the Infrastructure Hub and inherits vulnerability states by system contested value \*fixing pvp LP payouts at the current +225% In conclusion The ideas presented here that I feel can be achieved as quick fixes in the immediate future are: \[Tags for Missions\], which should have the greatest impact on FW tier manipulation and LP devaluation, \[fixing pvp LP payouts at +225%\] and \[docking restrictions applied to all structures\]. The rest, unfortunately, I feel will only come with further and deeper work when FW finally has a spotlight for dev time. "
34,vulnerability,Eve,We need a bot hitlist that tracks suspect bot owners through to a ban.,1,a5330s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/a5330s/we_need_a_bot_hitlist_that_tracks_suspect_bot/,2018-12-11 14:31:05,"Sitting at lunch today with another Eve player who is also a programmer we both started to theorycraft how a bit is likely made and ways to counter them.. as were over reading the same tired ccp should remarks on here. Theres a number of factors at play here firstly for CCP to automatically determine a player is a boy is near impossible with the current game client in its form. Why? COPY &amp; PASTE. Given we use copy and paste with dscan/ anoms &amp; localscan as a way of relaying important intel to each other during battles it also is a weapon for botters. You could in theory use them to determine where a VNI is to warp to and whether someone coming into local is worth running cautionary rules against .. armed with a software that carrys out xy mouse clicks and macros you could easily with this alone do about 70% of the boting mechanics. ESI SetLocation We wondered ok so how do you make the bot go to a set location prior to activating the above? Well with ESI you can set players desto via remote code .. so sort your overview with desto as first row and youve got your auto pilot done. Overview. Now one thing that was a bit of chin scratched would be how do they know where to orbit? As screen scrapping an entire 3D screen of pixels is overkill and messy.. but turns out if you edit the overview settings you can turn things on off .. specifically for havens the pirate gates are useful anchor points? So I think thats a likely weakness as well. GM messages etc. Now I think the GMs when they find the botters move them and convo them in local .. Ive seen CCP Falcon I think do this once in local .. from memory they show up as specific colour ? Anyway its moot because due to the fact chats in all forms are logged client side you just scan those and wait for a specific name criteria or words etc to appear The above is based on 2x beers and if we did how would we theorycrafting.. no clue if its realistic but with just those basic ingredients you could automate a lot of gaming behaviour with no detectable way other than perfection.. Thats the key here all the guards in place dont do shit.. what will catch folks out is not enough imperfections.. everything from mouse click cords, rate of clicks, session times etc all aggregate to a ratio that will stand out beyond normal.. or do they? I dont VNI rat but years ago when I did Id just warp to anom, park it and go do other stuff as its easy afk isk and if you die it was replaced by the time the km arrived. So is that a nerf centric feature on the horizon? So while there is a lot of energy around catching people boting with automated catch and release theories .. understand that in reality the mouse and keyboard are always the vulnerability for gaming .. clients have container protections that prevent assembly injection (ie beak into the memory and do bad stuff) but in truth you cant stop Ye olde mouse and keyboard.. You could block certain PID for windows but you could bypass software checks by using TeamViewer and the above .. as all the game sees is mouse and keyboard events being fired. Problem I think is the game makes it far too easy for this behaviour to occur. Even the font for eve is extremely weak for security.. given its constancy with kerning / height etc you could apply simple OCR readers and get high accuracy.. fuck it.. come to think of it.. looking at the font all you need to do is create a rectangle area, convert that to a image byte array and iterate over it to find pixel changes (think of a rectangle 128x128 grid and wait for each square to change color .. map that to pattens and you have inferred outcomes) So .. why post this? I think the key here is to demonstrate firstly CCP dont have the man power to counter the above by themselves and I suspect these fuckers who are laughing all the way to the isk bank are fully aware of it. What I think does work is we the humans need to dig deeper into our lets not let the game fail moral high ground and start actively shared broadcasting bot players and ensure coalitions, alliances and corps purge them firstly. Secondly we need to keep a hit list of botters found and status of ban or unbanned. If CCP cant cover the bot plague then its crowd source time. Actively keeping a zkillboard style list visible ensures sunlight disinfects .. sure some innocent folks get caught in the mix but thats easily remedied with ccp involved verification. We actively use this concept in RUST communities.. theres a list of ppl banned that community servers all pool together and enforce ergo reducing cheaters account sustainability.. furthermore certain servers have access to Facepunchs devs who help validate cheaters so they themselves can study the hacks but also support the community in the quest to purge. The community often self corrects the issue and enables the game devs to keep focused on other feature plans. Point is more can be done and unfortunately the level of after market solutions to enable a bot is extremely low tech that it honestly would take much to pull off.. Id like to see a more constructive approach to tackling the issue rather than just punishing features or players who do the right thing with theories on how to anti bot bug bash. Id also like to encourage coalition leaders to also be proactive with the list of bot owners .. in that if your area of sov is filled with too much activity then it falls upon these high end players to show leadership. Thats my 2c on the subject anyway"

This is Hugh Caswakk. Good evening. Pandemic Horde has retreated from their campaign in Branch, refocusing their efforts against Legacy and Imperium aggression in Geminate. Snuffed Out suffered a sharp defeat in Pure Blind at the hands of a range of local forces. The Caldari Militia is under heavy assault in their last systems  it appears likely that they will be forced from the warzone entirely in the coming days. \--- **PANDEMIC HORDE RETREAT FROM BRANCH, SUFFER REVERSE IN BWF** On Tuesday, [Pandemic Horde](URL announced an end of combat operations in Branch. Gobbins, Hordes leader, cited the pressure put on [Geminate](URL by the Imperium and Legacy as a core reason for the withdrawal. Moreover, DeadCo (who own Branch) have put up effective resistance backed by substantial Imperium military support. Therefore, in the face of threats at home and deadlock abroad, Horde made the decision to pull back. Moreover, they re-blued [NCdot](URL and [Pandemic Legion](URL facilitating a more cohesive defence. You can read Gobbins full announcement [here](URL This return to the homeland was not a quiet one. Joint northern operations began at once against the Imperium and Legacy attackers. In the early hours of this morning, this came to a head in [BWF-ZZ](URL The Legacy staging fortizar in nearby [Oijanen](URL had been reinforced into armour, with its vulnerability beginning late on Wednesday night. Legacy formed Megathron battleships and carriers, with the Imperium contributing Ishtars and Jackdaws. Pandemic Horde formed Tempest battleships and carriers, with Nightmare support from NCdot. The stage was set for a significant clash. It is understood that the combined PanFam (Horde/NCdot) fleet jumped into Oijanen but made no move against the Legacy fortizar. The structure repaired  as that happened, the Legacy fleet began attacking a Horde fortizar in system; presumably as a way to pass the time. After the structure had repaired, the PanFam force attempted to extract via the [BWF-ZZ](URL gate. However, Imperium and Legacy fleets caught them in BWF. The action initially went PanFams way, with fighters from Horde carriers playing a key role. However, Legacy brought their own carriers in and achieved fighter superiority. From there, the fight went pear-shaped for PanFam. The [toll](URL stands at 13.48bn ISK lost by the Imperium and Legacy vs 55.36bn ISK lost by PanFam. \--- **SNUFFED OUT LOSE A FLEET TO GALLENTE-LED COALITION** On Sunday evening, [Snuffed Out](URL took substantial losses in a one-sided clash with a disparate coalition in D2-HOS. The main participants against Snuffed Out were the Gallente Militia, Pandemic Legion and [Black Legion](URL Support was provided by a number of smaller alliances such as [Iron Armada](URL and [Free Range ](URL It is understood that Snuffed anchored three astrahauses in Gallente Militia space. This battle was fought as they were coming out of anchoring. It was important for Gallente Militia to destroy the structures to prevent Snuffed gaining a foothold in their space. They therefore mustered their allies and went into action, fielding 410 ships. Snuff brought only 110 ships but counted on piloting skill and a 23-strong flotilla of dreadnoughts with FAX support to win the day. Given the forces facing them only had 9 dreadnoughts without FAXes on the field, this was not an implausible bet. However, despite their apparent capital superiority, Snuffed subcapital numbers took their toll, forcing them from the field. [The toll stands](URL at 79.77bn ISK lost by Snuffed Out vs 13.26bn ISK lost by the defending coalition. [Ashterothi](URL leader of [Federation Uprising](URL (lead alliance of the Gallente Militia) said in an internal announcement that the action had proven Federation Uprising as a force not to be dismissed, but warned that the war will continue. You can read his announcement in full [here](URL \--- **DECEMBER WITHOUT HOPE FOR CALDARI MILITIA?** It has not been a very good year for the Caldari Militia. Two key alliances, [Templis CALSF](URL and The Bloc, exited the coalition after a series of defeats from the larger and wealthier Gallente Militia. While the main alliances in GalMil such as Federation Uprising have refocused their efforts, smaller Gallente powers remain on the attack against the Caldari. The Caldari Militia have now been reduced to a rump holding of 5 systems, which are under attack. The systems of [Asakai](URL and [Ishomilken](URL are the current focus of Gallente ire, contested to 53 and 59% respectively at the time of writing, with Gallente skirmishers keeping up pressure around the clock. Sources within the Caldari Militia do not indicate credible hope for victory in the conflict. Without the substantial and protracted intervention of a larger power, it seems that December 2018 may bring an end to Caldari power in the faction warfare zone for the foreseeable future. \--- For now, thats how it is in New Eden.

40,vulnerability,Eve,"Now that ECM is being reclassified as a long-range fleet taunt, isn't it time Caldari got a second ewar platform, just like every other race has?",309,9hray2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9hray2/now_that_ecm_is_being_reclassified_as_a_longrange/,2018-09-22 01:57:45,"I created [a forum thread](URL for this exact topic, but since many /r/eve posters are anti-fans of the forum, we can discuss the topic here, too. **Where Each Races Ewar Bonuses Stand Today** * Amarr: Energy Neutralizers and Tracking/Missile Guidance Disruptors * Gallente: Sensor Dampeners and Warp Disruptors/Scramblers * Minmatar: Stasis Webifiers and Target Painters * Caldari: ECM and uh ECM Burst? (lol?) **Looking at Ewar Bonuses in Light of the ECM Changes** This week, CCP announced that targeted ECM would be nerfed from a global lockout to a limited lockout, a taunt-style effect that makes it so a jammed target can only target the ship that is jamming it. For most applications, this may not change a lot. After all, a Falcon that is hitting logi from 80km away isnt at grave risk from dying to that logi ship any time soon. However, as pointed out by the community, this leaves a lot of holes in the lineup of Caldari ewar-bonused ships. Specifically ships like the Griffin Navy Issue and Widow, which are commonly used at shorter ranges and even in solo/duo/nano groups, now find their ewar bonuses all but useless. Its clear that balancing ECM both for long-range fleet taunting use and short range solo/small gang use may not be feasible, unlike most other ewar bonuses. **This raises the question: Should CCP introduce a new, second type of electronic warfare balanced for smaller-scale play, allowing them to design Caldari ewar ships into a greater variety of roles/directions than just long range fleet taunting ship?** *Yes.* In addition to solving problems such as the GNI and Widow, this would also create new design space both for existing and new Caldari ships, plus future faction ships that use Caldari skills. **Ideas for New Types of Electronic Warfare** The following are some concepts that may or may not be suitable additions to the Caldari ewar lineup. After all, you are reading a WINGSPAN thread. They are included here for exploratory discussion, but feel free to share your own concepts! **THERMAL PROJECTORS:** An ewar module that, when activated, applies heat to the targets high, mid, and low racks. This would apply heat to the racks, not the modules directly. In essence, it would increase the heat damage multiplier of the targeted ship, causing overheated modules to damage and burn out faster. This could be instrumental in limiting target performance and even causing stressed pilots to destroy their weapons, props, or tanks. Could be scripted to focus on high/mid/low instead of even heating. **INERTIA PULSE:** We have modules that slow targets maximum speed down, but what about a module that drastically cuts their agility? This ewar platform would not affect a targets speed at all, but would make turning painfully slow. In order to prevent it from being completely brutal when paired with webs, it could be fired like a pulse with a short duration and a long cooldown. **TARGETED VULNERABILITY:** In many RPGs, there are debuffs that temporarily lower a targets resistance to one type of damage. This module would do exactly that, create a short opening during which a targets resistance is decreased by a small amount. This would be a niche ewar system, but even with a 2% reduction, it could make the difference for a target with say 96% Kinetic resist. For a few seconds, it would go down to 94%, increasing kinetic damage getting through by 50%! Essentially this would punish higher res ships. It might also be a way to mitigate some of the kinetic lock of Caldari ships. For balance reasons, this effect would not stack, other than in duration. **SHIELD EGRESS SIPHON:** There currently exists no mechanic in EVE to counter passive shield regen, other than brute force. This module would cut the targets passive shield regen by X%, and increase the users passive shield regen by Y%. If desired, you could design ships bonused for this type of ewar by giving them stats that encourage a passive shield regen tank. **FOCUSED ENGINE LIMITER:** Right now, we have warp disruptors that are long range and prevent warping (and nothing else) and warp scramblers that are short range and also shut down MWDs, MJDs, etc. What about a tackle module that was long range and shut down MWD and MJD, but didnt prevent warping? In essence, this would be more of a mobility denial tool than a warp denial tool. **TARGET OBFUSCATION MATRIX:** This one is simple: ships that are effected by this module no longer see their own targets current shield, armor, and hull HP. Optionally, it could perhaps scramble overview information about the target: no pilot name, no distance, speed, transversal, etc. Your victim would still be able to fight the target no problem, but would have to use visual cues, fleet comms with, and personal gut instinct to guess how quickly their targets were or werent dying. This would pair very well with new ECM: Taunt a target and obfuscate it. Now they can only fight you, plus they have no idea if theyre even successfully killing you. **PLEX SIPHON:** Hit them where it really hurts, their wallet! Every cycle of this module, you drain 1 PLEX from the targets PLEX vault into your own. The perfect tool for pirates and misanthropes. Just kidding, I only put this here to see if youre still reading! Anyway, those are some half-baked (okay, quarter-baked) ideas for a second Caldari ewar system, but Id love to hear yours. What do you think?"
41,vulnerability,Eve,An Attempt To Fix Sov Warfare.,0,9hxloj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/9hxloj/an_attempt_to_fix_sov_warfare/,2018-09-22 16:21:17," In short the wall of text is my attempt to make sovereignty mechanics enjoyable to play by; - make citadels a key mechanic in sovereignty. Affecting how a region is maintained and the tactics of war - incorporate every aspect of the game and not only make it useful or beneficial. But in many cases necessary. - make it almost necessary to break up the blob fight and spread out your forces across a region. For along time sovereignty mechanics have been a seemingly unfixable part of the game. Well I propose not fixing it. But rebuilding it. From the ground up. And I think now there are enough established components to do it. (May require some new things as well.) Let's start with what should be the heart and core of sovereignty. - Citadels. - There's really no avoiding it. We need sovereignty citadels. Citadels that have modules and specific strengths that affect how your assets act in sov you hold. They should affect just about everything from production quality to d-scan, probe strength/efficiency, syno distances and the list of what should be manipulatable just goes on... But Sov citadels should be restricted to how many you can place in a region by how close together they are. And each will expand how many connected systems are under your control. For the sake of simplicity I'll use these values as reference. Sov Astrahus- Small amount of systems Sov Fortizar - Medium amount Sov Keepstar - Large amount They're are a few options as to how to limit the number of citadels. The one that makes the most sense to me is number of systems connected to the system the sov-cits are anchored in. (Just for the sake of creating a concept I'm going to use more arbitrary figures.) For example: You can't place a citadel in an area it's new sovereignty overlaps 2 systems you already own. Any overlap beyond 2 systems into non-allied space will not be added. Any space shared with non-allies is considered contested space. No additional citadels or structures can be anchored by any one. (Contested space can never exceed two systems.) Other options to limit the amount of sov-citadels that seem unfair would be alliance/corp population. Just an all out cap. Or no limit at all..... So in my brain I imagine the Sov Keepstar being the item that marks your territories capital. So it not only needs a good location, easy to defend but for good and beneficial reasons to defend it. But also beneficial reasons to destroy them. And only one allowed per alliance. Sov Keepstars once anchored will have the ability to fit module that link the Sov Keepstar to a single Sov Fortizar and apply buffs dictated by the fitted module. (I don't see why you couldn't target a different Sov-fortizar whenever you felt like) These modules will send these across space. I imagine a beam that acts much like the lines that show your route on the sky box. Sov Fortizars could primarily act as off grid boosters for whatever the group fits it for. Mining, pve, pvp or whatever. These buffs will be totally dependant on the mods they fit. But only reach out out a certain number of systems based on the mod. As far as sov goes. I think these sov-citadels should be the key to making the Sov-Keepstar vulnerable. Instead of timmers for the Sov-Keepstar there should be stages/levels. For simplicity let's say there can be a total of 4 Sov-Fortizars the can have the module that makes the Sov-Keepstar invulnerable for a specific level. So you'd have a level 1 mod, level 2 mod, level 3 mod and a level 4 mod. Or you could have 1 mod and every Sov-fortizar destroyed would lower a level. Now a probably unpopular alternative way to make the Sov Keepstar vulnerable is to have to take out all 4 Fortizars nearly simultaneously. First thing you have to do is force these 4 Fortizars on the same vulnerability timers. So all 4 go vulnerable at the same time. You split your forces into 4 fleets. One for each fortizar. Once a single fortizar goes into reinforced mode, a timer for 5 min will start and if all 4 fortizars are also reinforced within the 5 min. Than you have successfully taken down all 4 and can now go take on the Sov-Keepstar. If one or more miss the timmer. The fortizars are reinforced but get to skip the next vulnerability timmer. I only suggest a mechanic like this because sov holders should have to split their forces and not blob a single location. Causing tidi and boring fights. And the final structure will be the Sov-Astrahus. These will simply be for claiming territory. The smallest of amount of territory....but still. They could grant some smaller regional bonuses but. .. So by now you're thinking, great a suggestion for more structure grinding. Nope Thought of that also. This where point two comes in -Incorporate every part of the game- Right now living in sov is PVE, PVP, Mining, Production/industry and the meta stuffs. But there are parts of each type of gameplay that could be added to actually Sov-warfare. But first what should Sov warfare be? Just taking territory? Well kind of. I personally think Sov space should be the place every one of anny play style goes to contribute to a larger cause. In order to do that you have to make every part of the game necessary. I personally think that Sov PVP and mining/industry is pretty well established and doesn't need any tweeking to be effective in what I'm proposing. But there are some parts of eve that could be adjusted to give people advantages. The first is hacking/sabotage. Right now hacking is only used in one area of eve. Exploration. But we could make it a tool in Sov. First get the idea of the current hacking mini game out of your head. It would have to be something new. In order to get a good idea imagine this scenario. Your in enemy space, cloaked over their Sov Fortizar. Your using the new cloaking device that manipulates the Cidales shields to keep you cloaked even while sitting at 0. You activate your hacking mod and after successfully hacking in (phase one) gain access to see how the citadel is fit and a single module of your choice. In order to gain control of the module you have to successfully hack passed phase 2. You remain undetected until your first error. At which point any hanger in the citadel basically goes into red alert. Informing everyone the citadel is either taking damage or actively being hacked. And the hacker suffers a penalty to how effective their final hack(if successful) would be. If some one has permission to access the citadels fit, that person could see which possible modules are being hacked. The defender would have to right click the suspected module and activate a counter hack. Once they find the module the hacker is actually hacking the defender is put into the hackers mini game and now the mini game becomes a 1v1 mini game. If the defender wins the hacker is locked out and decloaked. If the hacker wins they do an amount of damage to the module, lowering its stats and modifiers. Now translate this to the sov system I propose and add something new. You hack into a Sov-fortizar. You make it past phase one and can see their module that if offlined would make their Sov-keepstar vulnerable for one level. Imagine you being able to place a virus on that module that will offline the module for x amount of time. Give your mates a window to attack. What about PvE. Let's face it first we need to up the difficulty of null rats. After you do that. You should be able to employ rats to defend non key but beneficial deployables that are helping you. Imagine a network of sensor arrays that alert you enemies are in your territory. For an amount of isk you could employ a limited number of rats that will defend said structure. Or you could hire gate rats.... Let's not forget about explorers. I think it's time to start thinking about allowing for a certain type of scanning that travels to systems your not in. ""We already have alts for that"" Yes but thanks to local chat the most Intel you'll get is local population. No what we may need is a more difficult way to scan but will allow you to get relatively old information on what's in system. Maybe information from an hour ago...or something Maybe make the scanners so large only new large ships designed for it can use it. And the power output be so massive you can't cloak. Of course you'd have distance limitations"

We had anticipated it right from the start and had been extremely nervous and scared for when that one special moment would inevitably come. It was unfortunate it came in the middle of a deployment far away from home. His mother and I would have preferred to have this conversation in as safe a place as we could make it. As it happened I was working in a station in nul security space where the corporation had an office. I had frowned at being asked to take the risk of making a journey through systems where there was no Concord protection at all. My conversation with my good friend Raymond must have sounded quite alarmed because throughout the journey there had been reports of pirates harrassing regular corporate operations in all the systems we passed through. Even then I was given to understand that no matter the level of protection our small fleet was given, in null security space all bets were off as far as safe passage was concerned. The idea of putting my son in that much risk was so terrifying I tried to get out of the engagement by demanding an obscene amount of money as a consultancy fee. The alliance that had chartered me answered my request by just depositing the money into my account without so much as a request for a justification of the cost. He had been playing with the Curse model I usually punched up for him. When he was in a contemplative mood he enjoyed letting his mind wander by looking at pretty pictures of space ships. He was particular to Curses, probably because his mom favoured them. Every inch of the ship he knew by heart and I noticed that he was starting to take an interest that exceeded the purely aesthetic. I could see him considering aspects of the ship, wondering why certain parts were the way they were and how they all fit together. He would sometimes ask me questions. What is this one for?; Why is that here instead of there? Wouldnt it be easier if it did that like so? A great designer was budding inside that mind, but I didnt want to push him. It would all come in due time, or not at all. There is always the risk that nothing will emerge despite a parents best intentions. This time he was looking at the model but not really focusing. He had this frown on his face that I recognised all too well. I had seen it in the mirror more times than I cared to remember. I sensed the frown forming on my own face now because his expression of it was more subtle and indicated real internal conflict. Whats going on, buddy? He shrugged. It looks like somethings troubling you. It will help you to talk about it. He sullenly looked at the ship model. Not good. We had encouraged him to voice his needs and concerns clearly and openly. We had taught him the value of communication. A lack of communication closes off many avenues for new opportunities. Where have you been today? I thought you were going to dedicate some time on your ship building skills. I pressed on. Theres a few other kids here my age, we hung out on one of the lower tiers. I didnt know there would be other children here, I said. I thought this place would be far too dangerous to raise a family. Some kids catch rides with capsuleer ships to get away, he said. Get away from what? I took a seat and tried to prepare for the moment. From their lives, dad. Theyre trying to get away from all the crap in their lives. Are you trying to get away from your life? I asked. No, I didn't mean it like that. I felt sorry for them without parents to love them. I nodded my understanding. What was it like interacting with people your own age? I asked. ""Well,"" he said. ""I didn't expect to see kids my age. It was nice to talk to someone who is not an adult."" He snapped his fingers. ""This is what I was thinking about when you walked in, when I was talking to the other kids, they each had a name. And when they asked for mine I couldn't tell them. I never thought about it that way. I don't know my name. What's my name? It totally freaked me out. Why don't I know my name? Is this something specific to our culture?"" ""*And there it is*,"" I thought to myself. ""*Today's the day*."" I thought about the conversation my wife and I had had about this very moment and how I should go about managing it. We had decided on allowing him to take the initiative and then give him a real surprise. ""No,"" I said. ""Children are typically named at birth."" ""So,"" his eyes lighting up with anticipation. ""What's my name then?"" ""Your mom and I decided not to give you a name."" He was dumbstruck when that registered. ""But... why? Don't you love me? Didn't you want me? Is... is that why mom has never visited us?"" I saw his face falling in utter despondency, it was the closest I'd seen him to crying with existential pain. I took him in my arms for a reassuring hug and wrapped his head with my knuckles. ""Hey, look at me, don't put any ideas into your head. Everything is ok. There's nothing to worry about. I promise you it will all work out."" I said. ""Have you felt unloved, have you ever thought you were not welcome?"" ""No, you and mom have been awesome to me. But I don't understand. Why did you not give me a name? Am I being punished? Is there something you want me to do? Do I have to pick my own name?"" ""Listen buddy,"" I said, ""I understand this is not easy. It's not easy for me either. Not giving you a name was extremely hard."" Is that why I could not play with other children when I was younger? Your mom and I decided it would be safer for you not to interact with many other people until we had had a chance to teach you a few things other children typically dont get taught. Certainly not at your age. He pointed towards the gear in my lab. Is it this? Is that what all this is about? I chuckled. No. Its definitely not about that. But is this not what I see you do all the time? Youve been in a lab like this for as long as I can remember."" That is certainly true. But this is not some kind of elaborate ruse. This really is your dads job. I design propulsion systems, among other things, for space ships. I am with added drama a *spaceship nerd*. The phrase amused me. I have been doing this long before I met your mother. In fact, this work has been the reason your mom came to find me. ""Mom came to find you? But why? Shes so much cooler than you are. I threw my hands in the air Well, thank you very much, beloved son! Who has been taking care of you all these years? Whos had to deal with all the inconvenient accidents and bloopers? Would that not be me, your dad? Well, yeah, but its mom whos taught me all the interesting things about stuff. All the things she does in space with her friends, that looks just awesome! This was the line his mom had been waiting for. Would you say it would be something youd want to do yourself? I asked. ""You mean: flying in space?"" ""Yes."" ""Don't we already do that? When we go to your new postings, I don't really like this place though."" ""Not like that,"" I said. ""Like a capsuleer."" ""But how do I do that?"" ""That, my dear boy,"" I said, nodding in the direction of his study room, ""is not a question for me."" He was out of the door without saying another word. He waited for me to join him in the study room. Hi mom, triggered one of a range of possible responses by the algorithm. This sequence was her sitting on a chair in a lab, intently studying the interactions of some chemicals in pipes and bottles. Oh, hey honey. There you are. I thought you were late for your lesson. Has your dad been keeping you busy? she asked. Sort of, we were talking about why I dont have a name. At once the scene the AI displayed changed. The speed of the chemical reactions increased dramatically until the room was filled with nothing but smoke. The room exploded in a soundless blast of white light. When the glare faded away the scene had changed completely. Now his mother was shown, dressed in the full regalia of her race and standing. Even I had never seen her dressed like that myself. I was stunned at the splendour she displayed. The left hand side of the screen was festooned with all manner of symbols some of which I recognised as Amarr design, but in configurations I had never seen before. She wore her robes as if she was part of the Amarrian royal family herself. In fact, I wasnt sure at all that she was not a member of the extended Amarr royal family. That part she had, in her own words, never cared to expand on. The AIs uncanny ability to track people allowed my wifes avatar to look me in the eyes as though she was physically present in the room. You need to make preparations to leave here as soon as possible, she said. Turning to our son she told him There are no oversights with regards to the way you were raised. Do you understand that? He nodded silently. It is also important that you are aware we have not elected to ignore your needs as an individual or denied you affection as part of a punitive regimen for perceived transgressions against a doctrine or philosophy. Do you understand? His face turned quizzical. What about when I flooded the apartment? No. Disciplining is not a punishment in the sense Im talking bout. We have been over this. Flooding the apartment does not help you grow into a well-adjusted adult, unless the disciplining is considered the material aspect of helping you grow into a well-adjusted adult. That was not the point of disciplining you for acting like a child. Destruction without direction is stupid and deserves no encouragement. Which is different from the time you disabled the stations power supply. That was a brilliant plan, perfectly executed. And we rewarded you for that. Why? You didnt let me flip the final switch. That was not necessary, I said. Your execution of that plan had been flawless. You did not need to complete the sequence. Nothing would have been gained by alerting people to that vulnerability. We also did not need the inevitable chaos that would follow the stations power supply failing completely."" All that, his mother continued to show you we had a plan to raise you the way we did. And that plan included not giving me a name? Very much, yes. Will anyone please tell me why? He turned to me in desperation. I pointed towards his mother. That part I happily concede to your mother. It was her design. He turned towards her. Mom? I have always wanted to tell you. That part of the plan requires for us to have a meeting. He opened his arms. Um, hello? Im right here? I meant, she said for you to come and meet me. In person. For a moment he was stunned, trying to understand what his mother was saying. Meet you? For real? I get to meet you for real? His mothers face gained an aspect of intense happiness. He started whooping and hollering as he was besides himself with joy. We gave him some time to burn away the endorphin rush. At last he regained some measure of composure. I cant wait to finally meet my mom! You have no idea how much I want to see you too, sweetie. Ill make arrangements to charter an InterBus transport she was interrupted by our son. I dont want to sit in an InterBus, I want to fly wherever you are in a Curse! She shook her head. Only capsuleers get to fly those kinds of ships, sweetie, she said. Then I want to be a capsuleer! Her eyes found mine in that uncanny way. She looked as if she was going to burst with pride. Do you really want to be a capsuleer? We float in soup most of the time. You dont get to stretch your legs a lot. Not to walk anyway. I dont care, Im going to meet my mom! Hes had every part of the training except for the trial, I said. If he can handle immersion and the right skills, he could fly every ship in New Eden. I believe so too, my wife said. She addressed him. Sweetie, this is one of the very few times where it is more important than anything else that you listen and accept what Im about to say. Do you understand? He nodded vigorously. This is not for your dad, for me or anyone else. This is for you and you alone. Your dad and I know you are smart enough to handle all the theory. You are years ahead of students of your age group. This is not about the theory. This is about taking the actual test to become a capsuleer. All other parts of the training are about learning how to work the systems and the technologies involved. And they are important, you need to understand how they work. However, none of it is as important as actually being in the pod. You will spend long periods of time in pods. You cant just tolerate the environment, you have to actually seek the experience. You have to want to be there. I know I will."" Listen to me, she said. Im speaking from long years of personal experience. I have a deep understanding of what this is like. You will spend a lot of time in that liquid. You have to do more than be able to tolerate it. You have to want to do that more than anything. To some it comes naturally, they take to it as part of their personality. Some people keep trying and they never get there. There is no shame in admitting the experience is not for you. It is important that you admit that for yourself early, so that you can move on with your life. Your father tried, a long time ago, and found it was not for him. Yet he is an accomplished scientist whose services are sought after all over New Eden. If you make the mistake of not accepting that limitation you will be looking forward to an absolutely miserable experience of life and that is not what we had in mind for you. You will have every opportunity to let us know what you decide, I said. Whatever your decision is, your mother and I will accept and respect it as your personal choice. This will determine the course of your life. Dont be afraid to admit youre intimidated by that choice, its perfectly natural. So, what do they make you do? My family also considered it very important that I know what I would be signing up for when it was my turn to take the test, my wife said. She displayed a schematic of a trial environment. It was a giant tank of the fluid capsuleers spend their time in when sitting in their pods. At regular intervals straps were mounted on the floor of the tank with breathing masks. The test was as simple as it was brutal. Aspiring pilots had to spend as much time in the tank as possible, to see how they reacted to being submerged for protracted periods of time. Telemetry measured physiological and psychological responses to stimuli. A harness provided the sensation of the contacts that would be inserted into the spinal cord after tests were completed successfully. People who could not adjust to the environment were removed to prevent psychological damage. It also ended their chances of becoming a pod pilot. These are typical test banks. Almost all factions use a setup thats similar to this. Most pilots receive their training in tanks like these. The scene switched to a different environment. This was a far more austere setting. This is what they gave us. We were put into the tanks and got fed a near-live feed of a ship as it went through its paces. We were able to command it, or it felt so real that when I commanded my first ship I could sense no difference. How long were you in the tank for? I was the last one out after about 3 weeks. I didnt leave because I couldnt stand it any longer, the tank developed a problem and to address it they had to evacuate the occupants, which was only myself by that point. What does it feel like for you? It is like being one with the universe, my wife said. She produced an image of a solar system. It displayed all important structures in exquisite detail. You know everything about the system, within scanner range obviously, your ships sensors capture the information. The difference between reading it off of a screen and the ships data feed is that you live the information. It is every bit as much a part of you as feeling your muscles twitch, the experience of sound, smell, vision. It is part of your homeostatic make up. The information is an intimate part of your psychological profile, you become one with the information, the information becomes you. It can be scary at first. It is one of the main reasons people cant take initiation. Many people are fine being humans, they dont much care for being a spaceship. ""I'm fine. Really, I'll be fine. When can I take the trials? What do I do to get there?"" His eager anticipation was most infectious. He saw himself already as the experienced space hand flying in his favourite ship on the way to his mother whom he would finally get to meet. ""If you took the Interbus you could leave as early as tomorrow morning, with the first ship that heads my way,"" his mother said. ""I'm not taking the Interbus, I'm going to meet you as a capsuleer."" ""This is not a negotiation. You are not getting your way by insisting you should get your way. Tomorrow you will take the InterBus, we will meet in Amarr. Believe me, you will have all the time in the world to fly as much in space as you want to. Do you understand?"" ""I understand."" ""Now, go to your room, pack your bags. Dont dawdle. I can't wait to meet you, it's been far too long since I last saw my boy."" That part was certainly true. I did not look forward to having to close this part of my life and say goodbye to my little guy, now a budding young man with a purpose in his eye. The following morning I could not find him anywhere in the apartment and the tracking system could not place him anywhere in the station. I went to the study and summoned the image of my wife. ""He's gone,"" I said. ""I've used all the scanners I could command but they did not come up with anything. He was seen with some people, somewhere around the space dock. A few ships have left this morning, none of consequence, none in directions heading to the Throne Worlds."" ""He has chosen his own path,"" my wife said. She projected an image of herself, comfortably sitting on a chaise longue, cocktail in hand in front of an open fire ""This is his first true act of rebellion as a man. He has decided to shape the world as he wants to see it, not as it was planned for him."" ""How does that feel?"" I asked. She beamed. ""Other than that it was planned decades ago, I couldn't be happier. My little man is going to make a name for himself, quaint turn of phrase there, and the old folks won't stand in the way of his ambition."" She did that thing of looking me in the eye again. ""The AI is not quite strong enough to be certain about your feelings. Let me tell you that you did a marvellous job. You should feel proud of yourself because you have raised a strong young man. This is not a failure on your or my part. This he had to do. This is what it needs. I would have been disappointed if he had taken that InterBus ride, it would have told me he was not ready for it, maybe he'd never be ready for it. He is to become a capsuleer. A pod pilot needs to take the lead in his own life or he's not going to be much use to himself. He has spread his wings, let's see how far he can fly."" ""I'm sorry,"" I said. ""I can't help but feel trepidation about the risk he's taking."" ""I fully understand, taking that risk is the leap of faith. With that risk comes the potential of great reward. He might fail. He might not make it through the trial, he might be killed before he is cloned. I would not be more heartbroken about that than you would be, I would at least take comfort in the knowledge that he lost his life choosing his own path. Many people never get there."" ""And where do I go from here?"" I asked. ""Why, dear husband of mine, we shall meet again, of course. I cannot wait to wine and dine you in the great houses of the Empire. A whole new career awaits you. A natural continuation of your work so far, a humble token of appreciation for all the risks you took and for believing in my absurd little plan. And for being a wonderful man. Were going to, ah take care of that comprehensively. She ended the conversation with the kind of pictures of her that went along with the first humans who ever set foot on another heavenly body in a bewildering show of light and lust, thereby ending the solemn atmosphere as I burst out laughing. She never ceases to amaze me. I had never been so delighted to break a contract with an employer as that day, paying the ludicrous penalty with a big smile on my face. *Finally*. Finally I got to go home. /end of episode 4"

It never got any attention. I will post it here, in installments, if that appeals to you. Why do I do this? So that the story might live, and for no other purpose. Do not spare me your scathing opinion. [Episode 1](URL [Episode 2](URL [Episode 3](URL [Episode 4](URL Episode 5. &amp;#x200B; ""Boss, stop fidgeting,"" Martok said. Martok, Helicity Boson's body man, was almost driven to distraction. ""What the hell is the matter with you today?"" Martok was one of the only people in New Eden who would have the courage to talk to her like that and not have to fear waking up in a medical clone. ""You act as if you're a girl on her first date,"" he said. Helicity raised her arms in frustration. ""I'm nervous, I haven't slept well. I haven't been myself all morning,"" she said. ""You're not kidding. We passed two Hulks and an Orca and you didn't even try to lock them. A guy with 200 billion ISK on his head got to waltz out of a deadspace pocket without getting himself popped. Concord popped your Curse, *again*, and you didn't even bother looking for your luggage in the wreck. And about that, your FC scooped it up and it's sitting in your hangar. You lost a set of officer mods and the two BPOs are gone as well. And to top it off, you came up in the elevator, standing next to a Brutor and yet, somehow the Royal Amarr Navy has not jumped to the slave worlds to seek retribution. So yeah, you do seem a little out of sorts today. Is it the weather?"" Helicity fidgeted again, trying to adjust her clothes. ""It's the robes. I don't know... Do I look too formal?"" Martok was baffled by the question. In al their long association he had never heard his boss express the slightest doubt or reservation about her attire, or at least not to his awareness.. He struggled to come up with an answer. You you look just fine. You always do. Boss... are you ok? Now you're making me nervous."" ""Or maybe it's the makeup,"" Helicity said. ""Would you say I was using too much lipstick?"" ""Boss, keep this up, I'm calling the doctor."" She waved a hand and giggled. ""No, silly. I'm just a bit giddy. I got myself a pair of Corsair heels, do you think they match the robes?"" She stood up and made a pirouette, looking at Martok to see if he approved. ""Ok, alright, that does it."" Martok nodded furiously. ""We're done."" He tapped his communicator. ""Doc? Martok. Helicity is having a stroke."" Helicity's eyes became large. ""Why did you do that? Why did you have to do that?"" ""Boss,"" Martok said, raising a hand. You're behaving irrationally. Something's wrong. You're not yourself."" ""Call him off,"" Helicity said. ""I can't do that."" ""*CALL - HIM - OFF!*"" ""You know I can't do that. I called him, he's coming. Nothing is going to stop him from seeing you. He'd never take a chance..."" Before he could go further a tremendous ruckus was heard on the lower floor. A group of men came down the corridor. One towering figure was dragging two station crew along as if they were garbage bags. He dropped them off in the middle of the corridor. One of his team mates threw up a sonic barrier. Then he approached the men who were scrambling to get back on their feet. ""Today is a good day for you!"" he said. ""This is your lucky day. You have no idea how glad you are going to be that we came by today."" He pulled out two credit sticks and handed one to each man. ""Take this money and walk away,"" pointing in the direction they had come from. The men hesitantly looked at the rest of the group that hadn't broken pace and was heading towards the upper level. ""Don't go that way,"" the guard said. ""It'll end soon, it will end badly for you and you don't want that because today is a good day. Don't make it end on a sad note."" Two other guards had walked to the base of the stairs. They had thrown up an opaque shield. They stood at the ready with a hand on their side arm. The first guard pointed at his team. ""They are not going to warn you, they will shoot straight away and they are very good. You'll be dead before you hit this fancy carpet here. Imagine bleeding all over this lovely rug. You don't want that. Tell me again why you don't want that."" One of the crew hesitantly offered ""Because... today... is a good day?"" ""Hot damn, you're good!"" the guard said. ""I bet you were the top of your class. You should some get some kind of medal, like what the capsuleers get, you're so smart."" ""Now,"" he concluded, pointing towards the exit, ""time for you to leave. There is nothing there for you. Nobody is being harmed, nobody's breaking anything and your station is safe. Get cracking, go now! As they were walking away, the guard looked at his tall partner. ""I think I handled that very well, wouldn't you say?"" The tall man paused for a second. ""You sure do talk a lot though."" In the mean time the last guard had gone up the stairs, leading the doctor who was engrossed in the telemetry from Helicity's implants. As they approached her, Martok rose to meet them. ""Doctor, I'm sorry, I spoke too soon. Everything's fine, you don't need to doffghlgl."" The last words were muffled as the guard put a hand over Martok's face and pushed him out of the way of the path of the doctor and then firmly guided him down the stairs. The doctor hadn't even registered Martok's intervention. He produced a scanner and beckoned Helicity forward while looking for any telltale signs of pain, discomfort or motor impairment the readouts might have missed. Helicity gave an exasperated sigh but the doctor did not relent. ""Stand still!"" He would not back down until his diagnostic was complete and he was satisfied she was fine. Not even Helicity herself could stop him, a fact she was keenly aware of. She submitted for as long as was necessary for the examination to complete. ""You appear to be fine. All readings are nominal to profile. There's a bit of an elevated heart rate and increased oxytocin levels. You're nervous and excited about something. Maybe you're horny?"" Helicity rolled her eyes. ""I - am - fine, for Bob's sake! I've got an important meeting coming up and I'm nervous about it. Have you never been nervous about anything?"" ""Do you need counseling,"" the doctor asked. ""I need to be left alone. Being left alone for a few minutes would work really well for me right now."" ""Is this meeting with someone we know of in our organization?"" the doctor asked. ""Do you need medication to help you deal with stress?"" ""No,"" Helicity said. ""This is personal business, I don't know whether there will be an operational implication. There might be one, there might not be one. I don't know how it will go. This is a family matter and frankly I'm very unsure about what will happen today. It should be fine, there's no reason to assume something's wrong. It's just..."" ""A family matter and one that gives you, *you*, stress..."" the doctor said. He verified some information. ""It has been long enough... is this about your son maybe,"" the doctor asked softly. Helicity froze. Her outward demeanor did not change, but on the inside she turned cold as ice. She had never mentioned having children to anyone and she was certain her husband would never have mentioned her by name or as the mother of his child. The security implications were too dangerous to ignore. They had a clear understanding of what could or could not be mentioned. She came to a conclusion. She would have to find out as much as possible about what exactly the doctor knew before she had to have him killed. It was not something she wanted to do, he had been an excellent doctor, but this was too much of a breach of security to be handled timidly. ""What are you talking about?"" she asked. The doctor shook his head and waved his tablet in front of her. ""I'm still reading your telemetry. Your cortisol levels just went through the roof. Let's not play games, you and I,"" he said. *Playing dumb isn't going to be enough*. ""Why would you bring that up? What makes you even mention that? You know what position you put me into."" ""I am your doctor,"" he said. ""My job is to care for you. That covers all aspects, if an emotional disturbance has the potential to affect how you behave it could jeopardize your entire operation. That is why I am here."" ""How... how long have you known about my son?"" she asked. ""Quite a few years ago you were in the field for a protracted period of time. Far longer than your typical stay in space,"" the doctor said. ""A holiday you called it. You have also been using this clone for a very long time. You don't typically do that. This clone is old. By your standards. You don't like being old. If you go through the effort of ageing a clone you had a reason for that."" He showed her the statistics of all her clones in various stations in New Eden. ""All your other clones are decidedly younger than this form and you have been extremely careful not to engage in combat when you are using it. I never questioned that. You do the things you do for your own reasons. But now it makes sense: you needed an older form to look more like a regularly ageing adult."" ""Go on,"" she said. ""How long have you been planning this for?"" ""70 odd years. It occurred to me that the opportunity might present itself and I did not want to be in a position to have to invent the logistics chain as events were overtaking my initiative."" ""Outstanding planning, as per usual,"" the doctor acknowledged. ""When you returned from your stay in deadspace you jumped into a different clone to start your delightful Hulkageddon initiative."" He raised the hand that held the tablet. ""Of course I performed a complete medical on the clone you left in the station, in Amarr no less. The queen of low-security space leaves her most valuable clone in the safest possible place she can think of. You are a capsuleer, I am a doctor. You know your job, I know mine. This is what I do. It was obvious that you had given birth to a son."" ""I don't know anything else about the event,"" he went on, ""and you may rest assured that I am not in the least bit interested in finding out what the exact circumstances were. I know my job, I also know my place,"" he said. Helicity was amazed at the casual mention of her deepest secrets. ""How, and why, did you keep that information out of the hands of the other doctors?"" The doctor smiled. ""I, ah, applied some liberal editing to the trace logs. I know I would never abuse the trust you placed in me, I could not be certain, not really, that my counterparts would likewise put their duty of care before a big pay-out. It is one of those things that you have to get wrong one time only for unrecoverable calamity to occur."" He produced one of Helicity's jump clone logs. Entries were listed in greens, yellows and reds to indicate the status of various aspects of the clone's condition. A tap on a button produced an intricate log file Helicity could not make heads nor tail about. ""The only true difficulty is to have all the logs update at the same time so that there are no discrepancies in the time stamps."" ""That has to be hugely illegal,"" Helicity said. The bone-chilling implications notwithstanding she admired people who had the mastery of their subject down pat to the level that they could bend the rules far beyond the line of legality. ""It's a hanging offence,"" the doctor agreed, ""I don't mean that sarcastically. People die for doing exactly that."" ""How did you know how to alter the trace log?"" ""It's really not all that hard,"" the doctor said. ""You just have to know where to look."" Helicity raised a hand to hold the thought. ""I'm not buying that."" ""Why is that?"" ""When I started... this project, I had my scouts go looking for a competent doctor. Someone who had no obvious ties to any faction and no latent issues with outstanding loyalties and liabilities,"" Helicity said. ""You were very gracious with your offer. Accepting it gave me liberties I would not otherwise have enjoyed."" ""I was not thorough enough in my due diligence, was I?"" Despite the blatant security issues Helicity could not suppress a smile. ""Why exactly were you on a remote outpost somewhere in low-sec, when someone of your abilities could easily make a stellar career in Empire space?"" ""It allowed me to apply my trade in the service of people who would not have had access to, forgive me the boast, good medical care otherwise."" ""That's a great crock of shit to sell someone on an intake interview. I'm going to have to talk to my recruiters."" ""I assure you, every word I said when I was hired into your service has been nothing but the truth,"" the doctor insisted. ""Oh, I'm sure you haven't told a single lie. I bet everything you said has been nothing but the truth."" ""It really was,"" the doctor said. ""But not all of the truth, was it? Hmmm? You maybe left out a few bits that you thought would raise too many questions?"" ""I have answered all questions I was asked without reservation."" ""We already established that. What's the punishment for altering medical clone logs,"" Helicity asked. ""Because of the extreme sensitivity of the issue and the nature of the people we work for, when found guilty of tampering with the 1:1 quality ratio of medical clone logs, the punishment is a default death sentence for all parties involved."" ""That's where you got that,"" Helicity said. ""You had altered a medical clone log."" ""Yes."" ""You were found out. ""Yes."" ""You were going to be put to death."" ""Yes."" ""Whoever you changed the log for had plenty of clout, a very great deal of money and they liked you a lot."" ""Yes, yes and, thank Bob, yes,"" the doctor said. ""They put you up in that deadspace pocket my guys found you in."" ""Yes."" ""Was there a compelling reason for you to accept my offer?"" ""Yes."" ""Was it money? Did you buy too many prostitutes? Got in a bit of a tiff with the fuzz? You had some gambling debts you could not get rid of?"" ""No, it was nothing of the kind."" ""You got bored, is that it? Too many drunks with funny infections? Too many whiny kids with a nosebleed?"" ""Actually, yes."" ""You're joking. You were set up for life. You could do anything you wanted as long as you didn't get into any trouble. Why would you give that up?"" ""I will be eternally grateful for the opportunity I was offered. I have had time to heal and to make a plan for what I wanted to do next. The only thing I wanted for was an opportunity to... to matter again, I guess."" ""Have you tried contacting your former employer?"" ""No. That would not be wise. I made a promise. That page is turned, I could only invite a lot of unwanted attention to my former employer and myself."" ""Were you aware of my reputation when you accepted the job?"" ""No. But that happened quickly though. You seem to leave quite a bit of an impression in your area of operations."" The doctor had seen plenty of newscasts decrying the unbridled ambitions of pirate capsuleers and their hunger for bounty at the cost and to the detriment of their fellow pod pilots. ""Yes,"" Helicity said. ""People do go on about that. I'm just providing a service to the greater New Eden demesne."" Helicity's propensity to go after miners in expensive ships had gained a notoriety all of its own. Although no mining ship in Empire space, or anywhere else, is safe, she has a particular desire to make that point clear to pilots mining in Hulks. She contemplated her situation for a moment. ""The information you had could have made you a fortune, even as capsuleers understand that concept. I'm pretty sure the idea of hitting me through my children would be an acceptable strategy for some of my opponents,"" she said. ""It would have been a breach of trust,"" the doctor said. ""In all my years working for you I have never seen you pass an unfair judgement to the people working for you. Harsh, yes. Brutal, sometimes. But always to those who deserved the object lesson. No doubt you have saved many people's lives, certainly their fortunes, by enforcing your policies. I found myself taken by your style, if not always by your politics. And of course, you have been nothing short of extremely generous towards me. There have been many, very many, opportunities to make a fortune off of that privileged position, yes, but never any temptations."" Helicity took some time to adjust her robes as she processed the information. The doctor had been keeping her secret all that time. She was taken aback by the realization that, had she been in a similar position, she might not have been as loyal to her employer. She had used strategic information on some of her partners that was far less sensitive than this to make a profit. The doctor must have had an inkling about how much money he could have made from selling this information, but he was not privy to the channels Helicity used to trade this kind of information back and forth. It would have been enough for a regular capsuleer to drain their assets and acquire that kind of knowledge. Information that would expose the vulnerability of a name, a character of notoriety in New Eden's social strata, an alliance would think nothing of spending the price of several titans if it meant it could strike a crippling blow to an opponent. For this kind of information she herself would have spent every single ISK she could beg, steal and borrow. She stopped fidgeting at last and placed her hands on her robe. ""You have been open and candid with your answers and you have served me far beyond any employer's reasonable expectation. For that I am truly grateful. In the future, if any obstacle should cross your path that you need help with to overcome, you will call on me first."" The words had come softly but it was very clear from her tone that they were final. The doctor didn't know how to handle himself. This was beyond anything he had experienced before. A capsuleer had reached out a hand in friendship. He was bowled over by the gesture. He quickly rose and made a clumsy attempt at a bow, almost bumping his head on the side of the table. At once the universe regained its usual proportion and Helicity found herself annoyed at how people behaved. ""What is that? No, really what is *that*? What was that supposed to be? For Bob's sake, man. Get a grip already. I didn't ask you to marry me, did I?"" She rolled her eyes. ""Are you done here? Is your examination complete? Are you going to tell me your telemetry tells you my heart rate just shot up because I don't enjoy the company of buffoons?"" The doctor hadn't lasted all this time because he didn't know how to land on his feet. ""Apologies. I momentarily stumbled under the weight of your generosity. That kind of gesture doesn't happen to me every day. I doesn't happen any day. My body couldn't keep up with my mind there for a second. My examination is complete, you're in superb condition,"" he said. ""Tell me something I don't know,"" Helicity said. ""Nice recovery by the way. Now get out, I've got stuff to take care of. Send Martok in."" The doctor, now back to his normal self, nodded curtly and withdrew with the guards in tow. &amp;#x200B; /end of episode 5"

Anything helps, from writing sections to linking us information.* [Click here to read this on our website](URL **THE HEADLINES AT 1900 ON SUNDAY THE 15th OF JULY** NER News at 7 oclock. This is Hugh Caswakk. Good evening. Imperium forces stand down from assault on CO2 keepstar armour timer due to cyno-jammer oversight. Legacy keepstar in 4-GB14 destroyed by North Eastern Association forces. Provibloc anchors keepstar in 9UY4-H. Ranger Regiment sustains heavy losses in Hard Knocks/Lazerhawks/TISHU ambush.  **CYNO-JAMMER SECURES CO2 KEEPSTAR ARMOUR TIMER IN DW-T2I** On Friday the 13th, a small Imperium force reinforced the shield of the [CO2](URL keepstar in [DW-T2I](URL Fade. This led to an armour timer for 1930 EVE on Saturday the 14th. Both the Northern Bloc and the Imperium formed large supercapital fleets for the engagement. However, an oversight in Imperium command allowed CO2 to online a cyno-jammer in the system. A cyno-jammer prevents the lighting of cynosural beacons, in turn preventing the Imperium from jumping into the system and bypassing the stargate. Imperium offensive logisticians (mostly from Goonswarm Offensive Logistics, GSOL) had anchored POS towers at all but two of the moons in DW. The POS at the unclaimed moons were both reinforced prior to the timer. This was intended to make it impossible for a cyno-jammer to be deployed. Unfortunately for the Imperium, it is possible to online a cyno-jammer on a reinforced POS tower, a fact seemingly forgotten or overlooked by Imperium command. CO2 promptly online a jammer, preventing the Imperium from jumping forces into the system. The gate from [O-CNPR](URL into DW-T2I was heavily defended by Northern Bloc forces. Imperium high command judged that attempting to storm the gate would lead to prohibitively high losses. Therefore, around 1830 EVE, the Imperium stood down. There was a much smaller engagement early this morning, when Northern Bloc forces attempted to reinforce an Imperium fortizar in Korasen, Black Rise. [This was a defeat](URL for the Northern Bloc, losing 15.38bn vs the Imperiums 4.02bn. In a formal statement provided to NER, [RiotRick](URL (SLYCE Alliance Executor, GOTG, Northern Bloc) said that: *Seemingly evacd and dead North, the Goons did a u-turn and retreated from engaging the Co2 KeepStar. This was their time to do revenge against their former ally. Posted on reddit, pinged in their coalition, they had us surrounded, we are evacuating, etc etc.* *And faced with a fight, when the line on the sand was drawn, Asher Elias backed down.* *Remember today their intelligence and bravery, because we did not see it. Fighting in EVE isnt about who is the #1 carebear in MER, its about crossing that line and fighting.* Imperium diplomat [Exonfang](URL (The Initiative, Imperium, Imperial Legacy) responded in a statement, saying that : *GOTG and their allies and pets still have not shown any real ability to defeat the unparalleled might of the Imperium  they have had the effectiveness of a wet noodle in every major battle since we anchored the Keepstar in 6RCQ.* *Sure, we lost to some archaic pos mechanics in DW-, let them revel in their victory while we wind up our next swing of the hammer. Well be sure to remind them of our intelligence and bravery in the coming days and weeks.* One thing remains quite clear  the northern theatre of this war is set to continue for some time.  **NORTH EASTERN ASSOCIATION FORCES DESTROY LEGACY KEEPSTAR IN 4-GB14** At 23:54, the Legacy keepstar in [4-GB14](URL Immensea, was [destroyed](URL by the North Eastern Association (NEA). The defenders mustered around 300 ships, mainly in a Goku fleet of stealth bombers, which forego cloaking devices for additional firepower. The NEA sent around 2000 ships, led by 33 titans from the Holy League. The structure entered final vulnerability at around 2239 EVE. Despite Legacy harassment efforts, the attackers had more than sufficient firepower to ward off the bombers while maintaining DPS on the keepstar. This represents a reverse for Legacy, and the broader Imperial Legacy bloc. However, it is important to consider that no major defensive effort was ever made. Moreover, NER understands that Legacy acquired the keepstar for only 100bn ISK. This all suggests that the defeat, while unfortunate for the southerners, is not a catastrophe. NER will keep you updated as the Immensea front develops.  **PROVIBLOC ANCHORS KEEPSTAR IN 9UY** At around 0030 EVE today, [Curatores Veritatis Alliance](URL leading Provibloc, anchored a keepstar named Eye of Providence, in the central system of [9UY4-H](URL This represents a forward step for Provibloc, which faced near eviction a few months ago at the hand of [Pandemic Legion](URL There were concerns among CVA that assorted low-sec forces, led by [Honorable Third Party](URL would contest the anchoring. However, the presence of a CVA cyno-jammer rendered this impractical. HTP FC /u/Meiqur said on reddit that: *Realstory, we missed for the same reason that goons didnt get the co2 ks into structure. Cyno jammers are oppressive and we didnt have the straight up numbers to break the gate forces + their fleet even with ship superiority. Wed have ended up having a protracted fight on a gate which we could have certainly won eventually but it would have not been able to break through to the KS grid reliably.* *All told today we were just a little outnumbered vs the proviblob in raw numbers (our total forces were around 250 and a modest contingent were running their own ops loosely in conjunction with us, but most didnt arrive until the actual timer) but still managed to outship them 15:1 in super caps and triage.* *FWIW its the first time Ive seen our comms ever get close to the 200 real human mark.* However, the keepstar is an attractive target. It is likely only a matter of time until Provibloc is called upon to defend it again.  **FIVE RANGER REGIMENT TITANS, CAPITALS, DOWN TO WORMHOLER AMBUSH** Between 0345 and 0419 EVE this morning, a combined [Hard Knocks](URL fleet (with [TISHU](URL support) baited out and [ambushed](URL a [Ranger Regiment](URL supercapital force in [QYZM-W](URL Branch. Following victory in the drone regions, Hard Knocks went looking for new content. They decided to target Branch residents Ranger Regiment. As detailed in an [AAR](URL on reddit, the wormholer force attacked a Ranger Regiment Rorqual with four supercarriers. This prompted Ranger Regiment to drop in 6 titans, supported by 8 FAXes and an assortment of subcaps. The wormholers responded with 23 supercarriers and 61 dreadnoughts, along with their own subcap fleet. Over the course of a few minutes, five Ranger Regiment titans were destroyed. The toll stands at 5.14bn lost by the wormholers, vs 389.52bn lost by Ranger Regiment.  For now, thats how it is in New Eden. Goodnight.  *Forward from tomorrow until 20th, I'll be totally AFK - sorry about that.* "

First question is I'm wondering if it's possible to remote rep a citadel in vulnerability mode in order to mitigate incoming dps to prevent attacking fleet from activating the stop timer. Or does it simply not work that way? I just figured since dps can be applied, perhaps it can be repaired as well ? Seccond question, is it possible to anchor a citadel if it's vulnerability timer might get interupted by downtime? For example, if I anchor an astrahus and time it to 10 minutes before downtime, it's initial and final 15 minute vulnerability modes should be interupted by the shutdown."

This is Hugh Caswakk. Good evening. A TEST Ragnarok titan [was destroyed](URL in the system of Y\-MPWL by Honourable Third Party in a pre\-planned ambush. Mistakes Were Made coalition in Tenerifis has officially disbanded. At least one member alliance plans to consolidate into one corp and join TEST. Caldari and Gallente militia forces have clashed in Asakai. Tactical Supremacy has engaged Curatores Veritatis Alliance, destroying numerous structures. \-\-\- **TEST RAGNAROK AMBUSHED BY HONOURABLE THIRD PARTY** Honourable Third Party have harassed Legacy and Provibloc forces through their reconquest of Providence. One of their main bases was their staging Fortizar in Y\-MPWL. In the early hours of this morning, its hull became vulnerable. HTP knew that Legacy would destroy the structure  the numbers were too imbalanced  but wanted to give the attackers a bloody nose in the process. Therefore, they devised a trap. The Fortizar became vulnerable, and TEST bridged a Rokh battleship fleet to attack it. Then, HTP moved in a dreadnought equipped specifically to tank the damage type of the TEST battleships. The TEST FC, with 20 FAXes on stand\-by, decided to drop a titan in to doomsday the dreadnought. He had deployed this strategy a week before to great success against HTP and felt confident that this would be a routine operation. The titan jumped in and, after some initial mishaps, destroyed the bait dreadnought. However, as it fired its doomsday in the process, it was immobilised for 5 minutes. This gave HTP a window of opportunity  they undocked interdictors in Y\-MP and trapped the titan. With the titan firmly in their grasp, they then jumped in \~40 dreadnoughts to kill it. The TEST FC responded by ordering his FAXes to undock and jump in to repair the titan. However, even as the order came through, HTP bridged in heavy interdictors onto the TEST staging Fortizar. With the undock full of warp disruption bubbles, TEST could not immediately go to support their embattled titan. However, this was an ambush, not a conventional battle. Despite losing the titan, TEST organised themselves within a few minutes and dropped the supercapital hammer. HTP evacuated what they could, and the rest of their forces went down fighting. The HTP Fortizar was later destroyed, but all sides agree that it was an excellent fight and worth the ISK. *With thanks to /*u/Seddows *and /*u/Meiqur *\(TEST and HTP FCs respectively\) for posting detailed AARs.* \-\-\- **MISTAKES WERE MADE DISBANDS** For the past few months, Mistakes Were Made and the Centipede Caliphate have been fighting a quiet war in Tenerifis. With the larger coalitions distracted by the 10 Month War, these small forces clashed repeatedly. That war is now over. At 1337 EVE, leader Ikta Shoridon [notified the coalition of the situation.](URL The Bastard Cartel \(TBC\) alliance, the coalition lead, has made the decision to consolidate into one corp and join TEST. Ikta has made the new consolidated corporation available for all Mistakes Were Made pilots to join. It appears that at least one leadership figure reached out to TEST to explore options for Legacy support of MWM. They were informed by Dran Arcana, chief TEST diplomat, that \`if you decide to stick it out in tenerifis, our agreement was with Ikta not with ""whoever is carrying the dead torch of his old coalition.""\` This person was further informed that the \`likely scenario \[is that\] you fall apart or get evicted by us or someone else. [You can read fuller logs here. ](URL At 1617 EVE, [Ikta made another announcement](URL that TBC would not be evacuating Tenerifis. This suggests an interesting expansion of TEST influence in the region. \-\-\- **CALMIL AND GALMIL CLASH IN ASAKAI** Between 0216 and 0248, Caldari and Gallente militia [clashed in Asakai](URL The battle began with GalMil engaging a CalMil Athanor in the system with a kitchen\-sink T1 battleship fleet at around 0200. Caldari Militia responded swiftly with a Rattlesnake fleet backed up with Basilisks. However, by 0219, CalMil had lost most of its Basilisks. Without logistical support, the Rattlesnakes were at serious risk. The decision was made by CalMil to bring in a Minokawa FAX to repair the subcapitals. GalMil responded to this by bringing in 2 Apostle FAXes, evening the playing field. With the situation worsening, CalMil threw down the gauntlet and jumped in 6 dreadnoughts and a carrier. GalMil took the challenge, moving their own force of 6 dreadnoughts and a carrier into action. The result was a sharp dreadnought scuffle between the two powers. GalMil won the day and reinforced the Athanor, losing 14.18bn ISK in the process. CalMil lost 22.48bn ISK. \-\-\- **TACTICAL SUPREMACY DESTROYS NUMEROUS CVA STRUCTURES** Tactical Supremacy \(TIKLE\) have been waging their own private war with CVA for the past few months. In this effort, their scouts identified that CVA had timezone tanked their structures in the system of PI5\-39 in AUTZ. This was to defend against the US and EU TZ heavy Pandemic Legion. Unfortunately for CVA, TIKLE is an AUTZ alliance, and set about reinforcing the structures. Today, at around 1000 EVE, many of the structures entered their final vulnerability. TIKLE formed up a 58\-man Malestrom fleet with capital and supercapital support to attack. CVA, realising the danger, put together a 47\-man Machariel fleet with two Apostle FAXes in support. CVA decided to gate into the system. On the in\-gate, TIKLE dropped on them with their full force. A brief fight destroyed the CVA FAXes and sent their Machariels into retreat to CVA Fortizar. TIKLE pursued with their subcapitals and began engaging the Fortizar. When CVAs Machariels fought back, TIKLE countered with long range fighter bombers from their supercapitals. CVA decided to withdraw from the fight, [leaving TIKLE to clear up the structures. ](URL total toll is 1.98bn lost by TIKLE vs 54.35bn by CVA.

48,vulnerability,Eve,What i think is wrong in EVE and why Brisc Rubal is my last hope,24,8ogxyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8ogxyi/what_i_think_is_wrong_in_eve_and_why_brisc_rubal/,2018-06-04 22:40:43,"I won't go into too much detail but here is my list of things that i think need fixing asap. #1. Citadels: Ever since citadels got in the game it's even harder for content creators to get reliable content. - **The defensive power of citadels** should only be there if the citadel itself get's attacked (if it loses 10% of its shields for example). In that case fleets or even solo players could actually engage on a citadel and don't have to fear being PDSed or killed by that citadel they don't want to attack anyway. It would enable station games to start the escalation chain and give ppl a little hope to catch something, bait something, bump something or lose something. - **Keepstar DD** shouldn't work on subcaps. CCP is concerned about headshots and gives us a new ship for it but whenever you get into Keepstar range you will just get DD headshotted along with 7 of your friends - **Tether:** Do subcaps really need tether? They can dock on any citadel anyway. The old station rule should apply - if you undock you are a target! - **Asset Safety:** I get the concern about ppl who leave the game for a while and then come back with all their assets gone ofc. But why not go with an insurance type of approach. If you pay 10% of your assets worth they are safe for a couple months (or whatever the golden numbers might be). If you don't insure and the citadel dies your stuff drops (like in w-space). Suddenly there is a minimum of excitement whenever you kill a citadel since there is always that one guy who fucks up and forgets right? Even if it just drops crap... it might be funny crap :D But atleast there would be a chance of something! #2. Faxes: I think everyone agrees at this point. Be it dreadbomb counters or wormholes or small/med/large scale subcap support faxes are extremely overpowered. - **Their active tank** is crazy and there is no clear counter to them since capital capacitor mods are a thing now too. A proper fitted fax can tank 100 Battleships or 6+ proper Dreads. The active tank ability needs to be looked at for sure! My biggest fear however is that ccp just go with only a slight decrease in repp power and give it another 2years to see how it worked out -.- - **The pricetag** of a fleet FAX is around 2.2B ISK (if you die with insurance you lose around 1.4B) and thats low enough so nobody cares about losing or killing one especially with SRPs. It's almost like FAX kills don't count in eve. If the amount of repp modules that apply on caps would be limited to a magic number (lets say a total of 15 repps) it would actually make sense to fit them properly atleast and therefor increase the pricetag and the loss. I'm still all for removing them completly and adjusting supercaps and carriers but that wont happen :( #3. Aegis sov: Everyone hates doing it (some may claim otherwise but you can't fool us cmon...) - **The amount of nodes** is still way too high. This was already approached but i think those changes didn't go quite far enough. The current system burns out FCs and thats the guys who make the good stuff happen so everyone should be interested in having as many FCs as possible around i would think. At the moment it starts with 4 nodes but it keeps spawning stuff (several nodes per system also) which results in everyone using ceptors to just be quick enough (yeah anything else just wont get there in time anyway) to clear those nodes. We could have 3 static nodes that respawn depending on the ADMs and it would actually give FCs the chance to get a bit of an overview of the situation and have a more tactical approach. Also... caps shouldn't be able to entose in general. - **Nullified Ceptors** are just OP. They should either have no guns but nullification (so they can do their actual job of pure tackle) or they shouldn't have nullification in the first place and can keep their guns. There are 2 ceptors for each race... we could have both i guess - **Entosis trolling** is a common thing and often its just doing the warmup cycle and then leaving. It will send a message and force ppl to come check it out even though you never started the actual entosis. The message should only be send if the entosis is still active after warmup. - **timezone tanking** im not sure if there is much that can be done to this but having an algorithm figure out what timezone your alliance is and set the sov vulnerability timers would make sense i guess. #4. Nullsec security: its supposed to be NULL SECURITY but the reality is different - **local chat** just provides too much instant intel and therefor security. It should just be a counter of how many are in local and show whoever talks (like w-space). It would give hunters and content creators a chance of actually catching something to trigger that fight. It would also profit smaller groups (yeah there are other groups than imperium and panfam that might want to do their own thing) and bots would have a real problem with this too im sure :) - **the amount of anomalies** in a fully upgraded system is insane. How is anyone supposed to catch ppl in a system with 50 viable anomalies? I feel like this wouldn't be a big problem without the perfect local intel. Its crazy that even a big alliance doesn't really need more than one good constellation to live and carebear. With less anomalies it would force bigger groups to spread out more and take more space for themselfs which creates conflicts and conflicts are content. It would also make it way harder to provide full supercap coverage then(we have all seen the latest videos coming from delve) #5. some smaller things that would make our daily eve lifes a bit better - **dictors should be aggressed when bubbling** - **command links shouldn't cause aggression** - **carrier NSA is OP** maybe they shouldnt recieve repps if its active - **fighter mwd cooldown is too low** #VOTE BRISC 4 CSM **If you look at Briscs website you will see a lot of similarities. I guess this comes from years of me getting triggered about stuff and starting rants about it in fleet. While most ppl roll their eyes and just hope i'll be done with it soon Brisc always listened with patience. That doesn't mean we wouldn't have arguments about things but since he issn't emotionally involved and has the ability to change his mind (a very much underrated ability) i feel like he is the right man for the job. So i hope a hand full of you guys consider putting Brisc Rubal on top of your voting list today instead of that generic alliance leader or ""slate"" bullshit that goes on every year (yes im looking at you mittani).** tl;dr vote Brisc for CSM cause hes the only guy i know with the patience to listen to all my bullshit and he got the ability to find the right mix cause he does not have a horse in the race."

They were: &gt; * the citadel can only be reffed in a single timezone, unlike POSes &gt; * the citadel cannot be defanged and bubble caged &gt; * the citadel has a aoe neuting weapon which forces attackers on one single viable doctrine (machs, which you now nerfed... wtf!?!?) &gt; * killing the citadel after all this work feels completely hollow as all assets teleport to safety &gt; * spammed citadels can be unanchored before the next vuln cycle with no possible counterplay &gt; * an infinite number of citadels can be spammed in any system We hate on CCP, but looking at this list, it is obvious that they do listen to feedback, considering the number of changes that have been made. Most of the changes were detailed [in this dev blog from January, referencing changes released Feb 13th](URL with other ""quality of life"" improvements discussed in an [earlier August 2017 dev blog](URL To whit: &gt; * the citadel can only be reffed in a single timezone, unlike POSes The introduction of the LOW POWER system, and the first timer being at a time of the attacker's choosing, has greatly reduced the pain of this point. Citadels that are in active use are still difficult to destroy (as they should be), but spamming troll citadels now means also fueling them all, and conceding the first attack time to the attacker. &gt; * the citadel cannot be defanged and bubble caged This is still true, and is a major advantage, however, the jump-tether timer does mean that interesting plays are still possible while capitals are moving, and there is somewhat less safety. &gt; * the citadel has a aoe neuting weapon which forces attackers on one single viable doctrine (machs, which you now nerfed... wtf!?!?) The removal of void bombs has been one of the best changes CCP has done in the last year, *bar none*. The first attempt to make them less of a problem (linked in the dev blog from August), which nerfed their fire rate, AOE, neut ammount, etc did not do as much as desired to switch up the structure attacking meta, and CCP watched and listened, and removed them. CCP, in their own words: &gt; ""The addition of the new Standup Energy Neutralization Burst Projector will replace the functions of the Standup Void Guided Bomb, which has been causing balance issues. The Neutralization Burst Projector requires more skill and forethought to use and has significantly more counterplan available, making it a better choice overall for the EVE combat environment."" I couldn't agree more. Machs are not the only fleet comp available now - so many other doctrines are in use, and it's really created an era of evolving meta in which involving yourself is extremely satisfying. &gt; * killing the citadel after all this work feels completely hollow as all assets teleport to safety This is still a reality, but with the removal of conquerable stations in null-sec space, I think we can pretty much all agree that, without this mechanic, Eve Online - an already extremely harsh game - would become almost unbearable. &gt; * spammed citadels can be unanchored before the next vuln cycle with no possible counterplay The new anchoring mechanics, combined with the new vulnerability timer system, make this also much less of an issue, though spamming citadels can (and does) still happen. &gt; * an infinite number of citadels can be spammed in any system Also still true, but I don't know that this is a bad thing. It can be a very annoying thing (simple farmers in 9KOE, for instance), but it, in and of its self, is just a reality. Gobbins then goes out to point out a few more things - specifically that the anchoring and vulnerability mechanics decrease the tempo of an invasion to such a degree that it robs content from both parties; and that the increase in null-sec PVE is a massive cause of other problems. I think that it's fairly easy to see from recent examples in the north, in the south-east, and in the east that there's nothing wrong with the tempo of an invasion at the moment. And (much to the chagrin of those of you who were making dank 280m isk ticks), PVE has been significantly nerfed, though still very sufficient for building a war chest. In short: We do rage about things on this subreddit. However, while it's not my intention to white-knight for CCP, an objective look at what's happened in the last year shows that they *are* listening. There are missteps, but there's also forward progress. So, to everyone who cynically clicked on the ""RemindMe"" bot link in that thread, expecting that the game was RUINED FOREVER: I hope you're pleasantly surprised to be wrong. I know I am."

53,vulnerability,Eve,"Reminder: Krablords like GOTG are enabled by ""final stand"" timers",88,8bj5pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/8bj5pq/reminder_krablords_like_gotg_are_enabled_by_final/,2018-04-12 04:01:40,"Hi team I'm Jordan, In my last (several) threads, of which this one is 99% a copy paste of my last one, I've mostly tilted about stuff I dislike about citadels, particularly the final timer of all citadels. In that thread I received a lot of responses orienting on timezone so I decided to repost this thread to help illustrate the issue considering it seems that the practice has been adopted by GOTG as well. To provide a bit of context for where my opinion comes from and to hopefully avoid spurious shit like ""muh timezone"": I am an American player playing in a group of Europeans fighting against a (now) mostly European collective subservient to Russian rentlords. Previously, (prior to the upwell firmware update and certainly prior to citadel) attackers had a decent degree of influence over the day of a timer. This allowed me - while not perfectly able to play off-timezone during every day of the week - to participate on days that I could. Lets call it 4-5 days a week. Because of the upwell citadel firmware update we (both my group and much of the leadership of other groups I speak to) have observed every citadel in a given region being timed to the same day and time. Now, in previous discussions people would generally focus on time and assumed I was speaking about timezone tanking. That is, generally, not the issue whatsoever. Letting defenders pick the day when the final citadel timers come out was a huge mistake, not even barely mitigated by the addition of the 4 hour window instead of 15 minutes. CCP had a good idea to begin with by making citadels easier to kill, but they ended up completely flopping on the final stretch by letting people timezone tank even worse than before. Now timezone tanking itself may be a necessary evil, but in many cases you could mitigate this evil by making weekend timers. Hitting poses on thursday/friday to get some weekend content was amazing, now were left with creating a bunch of uncontested timers that come out on a single day during a 4 hour window. CCP made citadels easier to kill, but they added a mechanic that makes it impossible to keep up with citadel spam. Imagine clearing out multiple regions worth of citadels all timed for Wednesdays at the same time window. It is simply absurd. I think (and I may be very wrong) that a lot of eve players have become disconnected from the very nature of what eve was. Nothing should be safe, losing your stuff was just a fact of life. Im not advocating that you should be able to roll someone out of their space in a weekend, but current mechanics are stifling actual pvp. No one objected to their supercapital construction poses being vulnerable (even though pos mechanics sucked for the user), and supercapital assembly arrays as well as moon mining poses lead to a lot of amazing fights. Now you have long timers that lets the defender call in every defensive favour they can - and conveniently enough all defensive timers can fall on the same day and same time. Additionally, defenders shouldn't be able to chose what day their stuff comes out, because now literally every citadel resorts to almost the same vulnerability window that Astrahouses had (3 hours, but now a 4 hour window for final timers) resulting in only being able to kill fortizars and sotiyos for 4 hours a week I think eve would benefit from giving defenders a lot less freedom in defensive timers. Citadels are fantastic from a user standpoint, ACLs, reactions, construction, etc is really streamlined and nice. But holy shit it sucks for an attacker. Bring back shorter timers, bring back occasional losses of stagings (weve got asset safety anyway), bring back both week and weekend fights. tl;dr: Dissuading inter-timezone conflict via final stands in a persistent, multinational, single-shard, game makes the game more stagnant and a lot more boring. [It does nothing but allow krabs like gotg to declare that they will time everything to a middle of the week day and defend once or twice per seven days.](URL Unless you can win within the 4hrs of a week determined by the defender - you cannot do anything to inflict lasting damage to a defender.

I.e. I shoot a structure in highsec. It is full powered and has not been shot before. It has a vulnerability period set to 12:00 Wednesday eve time. I complete the reinforce by 11:30 Thursday. This means the armour timer should be in a minimum 24 hours, and the timer has a variance of +/- 2 hours. A number of different scenario's are possible depending on the order of checks (minimum hours and variance) A) Variance occurs and happens to be minus two hours. If the logic is 24 hour check hours first and then variance is applied, the timer would be the next vulnerability time more than 24 hours later (12:00 Friday) and then 2 hours is subtracted (10:00 Friday) with the total time between timers being 22.5 hours. B) Variance occurs and again happens to be minus two hours. If the logic is variance is checked first then the timer of 10:00 Friday doesn't meet the minimum 24 hour period, so it's pushed back a further day until Saturday 12:00. In this case if variance had happened to be plus 2 hours, the timer would be 14:00 Friday. Have we got CCP stating anywhere that A or B is the case? Cheers. "

I and others volunteered for this duty and surprisingly had little trouble finding several pieces of flotsam and jetsam floating in various wormholes. &gt;However, no system had quite as monumental a pile of dreck as J120256, with two low-powered Ratiarus and three low-powered Astrahus (Astrahi? Astrahuses? Astrahusi? Whatever, I digress.). Such refuse floating in space cries out for removal! &gt;Luckily, the Delivery Agents of the WiNGSPAN Sanitation Engineering Divsion, ably led on this day by Ackbad Pappotte, rapidly deployed a L.U.S.T. fleet and proceeded to make copious deliveries of sorely needed munitions, fully sanitizing the overview and d-scan in J120256! After doing so over a two-hour period, to our dismay we found that the result was even MORE garbage in system, requiring approximately 8 rolled holes and 6 hours of numerous sanitation engineers literally taking out the trash. &gt;We do thank you for your foresight and consideration in making available so many haulers.

What about unanchoring-fees similar to asset-safety at around 10% of the cost from the structure. Of course only payable if succesfully unanchored, maybe during the process of scooping it to cargo bay. Lore wise could be damage during the reduction and a few not removable parts. This could come handy with an easyier unanchoring process as a trade. You should be able to get your structures to a new home, but not for free.

59,vulnerability,Eve,Test Alliance leadership Statement Re: upcoming Citadel changes,897,7rland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7rland/test_alliance_leadership_statement_re_upcoming/,2018-01-20 07:34:24,"Recent history has shown us that ignoring changes made by CCP is no longer an acceptable option. I have for thirteen years let CCP do their own thing, make the decisions, and been fine to suffer the consequences as necessary. After a time we all develop the feeling that we know best and certainly I often feel this way. I know that I am wrong at times (meme away), but my breadth of experience does lead me to some very obvious conclusions that myself and many other leaderhship figures of alliances throughout the game all seems to instantly grasp. The upcoming citadel changes have a number of positive elements. The changes on timers, activity states, fighters and warp scramblers are all overall positives. None of these changes are 100% perfect but I believe each change is a net improvement and will make the game better. The changes to lock range and new T2 modules for the most part are hard to evaluate and could go either way. Judging the positive or negatives of these changes is arguable and could go either way. Increasing the DPS potential of a fort seems like a negative when it does not need it but I havent seen the exact fitting changes and what exactly it will have to sacrifice in some areas to gain in others. The Lock range change seems mostly irrelevant since the missile speed is already so low than at ranges of 300km youre looking at a back loaded 20% dps at best. However I am more than willing to accept that it might be positive or negative. These changes are not what I am here to talk about thought. They are points of interest or improvement. What must be discussed critically and with most vigor to avoid or prevent implementation is the addition of the Gravitation Transistor Field Oscillator (GTFO) module to all L and XL citadels and the addition of a 5 minute fitting window to anchoring citadels. The GTFO module is currently a perfect example of a game breaking module that is getting little action due to the lack of meaningful decisve battles that have occurred in the past months, but when it has been used in heavy TiDI (a feature of almost all decisive battles) it has been absolutely devastating and miserable to play against. As it currently stands the citadel GTFO module is a 300km device with a 90 second cooldown compared to the titan 100km with a 5min (adjusting) cooldown. It will be deployable on 4Bil Azbels, and up, versus 60Bil minimum for a titan. The problem of citadels since their inception has been the monumental defenders advantage that they provide and it has absolutely diminished possibilities for conflict. When a good FC looks at a fight he factors in the worst possible case scenarios into his evaluation, he looks at how likely he will be to get doomsdayd, or misposition or get pinned by dictors etc. If the odds do not look favorable then FCs simply do not chose to engage. With the GTFO module that worst case scenario now allows for half or all of your fleet getting removed from the field and being forced to warp back, interdicted by bubbles every 90 seconds. This does not facilitate conflict and is a module ten times more overpowered than the void bomb launcher ever was. This does not even factor in the most fundamental problem of the GTFO which is how it works in relation to tidi. In a large fight with tidi, which because of the massive defensive advantage that fortizars and keepstars provide those structure timers are often sure to be, the GTFO represents the possibility of removing 100-500+ people from the battle continually in some of the most mechanically toxic gameplay imaginable. Imagine coming to a large battle, ready for the epic timer of the month only to be blown many AU away at the start of the fight in 10% tidi. Then after 30 minutes warping back to be just booshed away again and then again. All the while the timer of the structure is repairing in real time. This is not feasible, functional or fun. This is not good gameplay. Tactically it a nuclear weapon placed upon a tank that is already fighting against dismounted infantry. This is wrong and if it goes into game I fear for the next six months of conflict before CCP is forced to remove it. The Second monumental mistake contained within this patch is the 5 minutes to fit onlining citadels. Oh lord this is a mistake. When a citadel is onlining is the only time it is vulnerable without its massive defensive advantages. By allowing a fortizar to be fitted before onlined you create a situation where offensively placed fortizars are given the advantages of the defender. This is stifling to conflict because the primary time when two forces that are evenly match can engage in conflict is when neither side has a large tactical advantage over the other. People rarely take fights that are mismatched and this instantly creates a mismatch. Trying to fight on an onlining citadel already provides the deploying side with the advantage of location choice, timing and tether advantage. By giving them the further advantage of a fitted citadel you exacerbate this problem and create further awkward stalemates where alliances cannot even prevent the anchoring of hostile structures in their space without a massive over-effort compared to their enemy. Which then allows the enemy to not fit the fort and save the expense for the next one. This further pushes the reality of nobody fighting because attacking an armed citadel is so counterproductive to capitals and the defenders advantage is now available to both sides. Thus an attacker drops a citadel at a time of their choosing, is allowed to fit it before vulnerability and has both tether and capital force advantage for a citadel dropped anywhere in eve. This will be a massive regression in the combatting of citadel spam. I cannot state how much this will make citadel spam even more toxic and annoying than it already is. The reason there are so many fights over anchoring citadels is BECAUSE the attacker of the citadel is rewarded for showing up at the time of the defenders choosing creating a situation where conflict is promoted to each side by giving them an advantage they would otherwise not have. I hope you can hear my words. I post them now because I dont want to spend six more months or more under new mechanics that are even worse than the ones we have now. As the patch looks now if the two negatives go through they will be a bigger net negative than the positive elements of the patch and it will represent an overall regression in the mechanics of eve-online. Please do not let this go through as is. You will regret it and many of us may not be here to say we told you so. "
60,vulnerability,Eve,A plea to CCP: Please do not allow citadels to be pre-fitted in Citadel 2.0,309,7s3d5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7s3d5j/a_plea_to_ccp_please_do_not_allow_citadels_to_be/,2018-01-22 15:36:58,"**tl;dr citadel 2.0 creates a further toxic environment in which the attacker receives the advantages of the defender and it adds to the already heavily defense favored meta, please reconsider ccp** **Dear CCP,** I am writing to you as a long time player of your game and someone who considers themselves pretty knowledgeable on citadel mechanics. That being said, I may make mistakes in my explanation of things and I apologize in advance. **The Problem (In Wormhole Space)** As a long-time resident of wormhole space, I am not 100% experienced in eviction mechanics, neither on the receiving end or the giving end, but I have experienced both at least once and I think that qualifies me to at least speak about it. One of the biggest worries of small corps like mine with 20 to 30 people is not being able to effectively defend your home, even if you do have the home field advantage, capital advantage (if you're in a low-class hole and nobody sells caps to the aggressing force) and the urgency to defend, Citadel 2.0 exacerbates this feeling substantially. If someone decided they did not like me, after February 13th they could drop a Fortizar in my home, stacked with Tech 2 modules and new substantially more powerful fighters, seed an eviction fleet, and the defender's advantage is flipped entirely, and the ability to dictate both **a)** the engagement itself, and **b)** the terms on which the engagement takes place (time, location). Both of these are usually relegated to the offending party initially anyways, because they were drop a staging citadel anyways, but it is not relevant to the combat ability of the offender itself as it's not fitted and purely becomes an objective. **Case one.** Why is this a problem? It lies in the fact that there is nothing the defender can do to stop the fitting of this structure in the grand scale of things. If you're expecting an eviction, and the offending party doesn't pre-seed a hauler containing the citadel and fits, you might catch them in a dictor camp and that sort of solves the problem, but if somebody does it sneakily (e.g. moving a hauler in at downtime), the odds of you seeing them drop it and fit it is highly unlikely. As the defender, you are forced to risk everything fighting this structure that is instantly fully capable as yours that you had to defend in its vulnerable state without any fittings, as soon as it becomes vulnerable. **Case two.** The same people who don't like you and want to evict you decide to spent the 15 to 16 billion they would have spent on a Fortizar instead on 8 fitted Astrahuses. They drop all 8 at the same time and pre-fit them all. When the vulnerability window starts, the main fighting is likely to centralize around one of the citadels, while the others begin ticking down. In Citadel 1.0, it would theoretically be possible to confine the attackers to anchoring one citadel or perhaps none at all, as you can send a few alts in long-range, slippery ships to each citadel to pause the timers (damp cerbs come to mind), but assuming Citadel 2.0 changes, the structure can defend itself from this handful of people, which means that each structure is likely to anchor if the two main combat fleets become engaged on one grid. **Case summary** Does this force the defender to mobilize to save their home, and stop citadel turtling? Absolutely, but it's also harmful and unfair to the people who had to put work and fight to online their structures. I believe CCP's intention here was to help combat citadel spam by incentivizing the attacker to drop citadels to combat the spammed citadels, but it misses the mark on the ground that (I BELIEVE, MY OPINION, NOT NECESSARILY WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN) it actually promotes more citadel spam, as attackers will just spam Astrahuses to start invasions in all regions of space. **The Solution** Unlike some other people who frequent this sub, I claim to be no expert in game balance or an armchair developer. I can't give an immediate idea for a fix beyond not shipping it to TQ in Citadel 2.0 and rethinking how they would like to combat citadel spam.

61,vulnerability,Eve,CCPlease Check this Citadel Change!,0,7s9xat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7s9xat/ccplease_check_this_citadel_change/,2018-01-23 10:11:35,"I.

Lets be realif Super Carriers and titans cant enter WH space, neither should Keepstars. There are no Titans or Super Carriers to dock! - Fortizars, Azbels, and Tataras are structure enough. Enough said. Dont let this discourage you from reading farther! 2. Anchoring Time/Vulnerability Window Changes Now the part thats going to either get me castrated or praised, depending on your point of view. We can all agree that Citadel mechanics need to be changed. Currently the debate centers around on-grid mechanics, and those do need to be addressed, however this concept proposes a change to the basic nature of citadel deployment, citadel anchoring, and vulnerability window mechanics. The current proposed February changes by CCP should only be implemented in Non-Sov space. In Sov Null, citadel timers ought to be connected to Sovereignty. This would eliminate the need for this new system in Sov Null, and replaces it with one that is not only more equitable, but one that reinforces the importance of the existing Entosis mechanic. Having lived in every security status space in New Eden - High, Low, WH and now Null - Iahve experienced the great power and awesome annoyance of citadels. I strongly believe that citadel deployment itself needs to be addressed before on-grid mechanics. Specifically, the security of citadels need to be tied to the Sovereignty of the systems they are deployed in. This change would eliminate the dropping of troll citadels without consequence, the dropping of tether structures without consequence, and also add greater weight to the iHub and enosis mechanics, which would directly strengthen/weaken a citadels in systems. 3. The Idea URL The idea is that a systems Activity Defense Multiplier determines the anchoring time and vulnerability window of citadel structures. This does not mean that dropping a citadel is impossible for an invader, it just means that it is more difficult in higher ADM systems, and far easier in lower AMD systems. In warfare, a nation-state could not merely establish a base of operations directly in an enemy nation-states capital without significant resistance. It would be more feasible to invade another nation through the outskirts. I mean, what is a small group of farmers going to do? Invading from the the countryside, then the suburbs, and then on to the cities. In EVE, we are basically allowed to put strongholds in the middle of an enemy city, defend it for 15 minutes, and then set the timer in our favor. In reality, an invader would have to constantly defend against the defensive force, forever, without rest. It is known. With this change, an invader could still deploy a citadel in the defenders space, but it would then need to be defended for a time proportional to the current ADM level of the given system, up to a full 24 hours, before it comes online. The structure would then need to sustain a large vulnerability window until the ADM in that system dropped or the iHub were destroyed and replaced. The vulnerability window would shift dynamically around a central vulnerability time based on the ADM level assessed at each downtime. The proposed changes would make it far more favorable for an enemy to stage a citadel in the lower ADM systems. It would online faster, and have less vulnerability. Oppositely, the defenders structures in the same systems would suffer longer anchoring and vulnerability windows, making them easier for attackers to destroy. What do you think? The IG mechanics are already in place to support this, and it almost makes too much sense. Structure generally become more vulnerable around New Eden, but capital systems remain strongholds, as they should. (Please keep in mind these numbers are merely conceptual, but the idea is a proportional relationship between ADM and Anchor/Vulnerability. "

I run a small Corp in HS and I'm looking to set up a few POCOS in the system we operate in. There are at least 3 offices that are owned by a Corp that has been inactive for multiple years and I'm thinking it should be easy to take them. I'm not the most experienced player though so o want to make sure I can do this with a minimal chance of messing up and exploding myself. 1: while attacking the POCO, will pilots gain a suspect timer and be vulnerable to attack from anyone? Or can only members of the Corp whose POCO I'm shooting at attack me without concord interference? 2: how much dps do I need to do this within the span of a day? POCOS have absurd hitpoints. The ships we'll be using are all fitted for max dps using energy weapons and drones for minimal supervision. 3: reinforcement. How do? Seriously I'm very confused about the mechanics of POCO reinforcement. So once the structure hits 0 shields it becomes invulnerable until it hits the next vulnerability timer as set by the owners. While a POCO is invulnerable, will it's shields recharge? Once it exits vulnerability, will it's shields recharge? In order to prevent a POCO from entering reinforcement again, I need to keep its shields below 25%, right? So if I go through the work of killing the shields how much leeway do I have as far as getting ships back on grid to finish it off? Any useful info or tips for POCO bashing is much appreciated."

Fewer individual modules to produce lag. ie make passive version of the shield adaptive hardener, forceably group guns, group ECM (and in general make ewar a highslot module so you use less cycling guns in favor of ewar and can't have 600 ships with 8 midslots producing soul crushing lag), most ships should get bonuses to guns like the marauders so that they have fewer guns but does an appropriate amount of damage (there be morons who don't group guns on attacking side, and the defending side doesn't group guns because tidi favors them), make fighter squadrons bigger so that carriers only field 1 flight and supercarriers only field 2 flights (one heavy and one light, or two light). 2. Don't have a small piece of code which says reloading fighter tubes is not important in tidi. 3. Lengthen the cycle times of stuff that don't make a difference either way, because it lowers server-side actions to be done (the carrier highslot sensor module, lets say, and command bursts could be a few minutes longer, and hardeners could have longer cycle times, etc). Then maybe a few pointers to make eve less broken with citadel structure spam: Make sure the asset safety works with everything, have 15% tax on modules and non-ship assets in general, then 10% tax on subcap hulls, 5% tax on capital hulls, then you can make citadels easier to kill since they're just actual convenience not vital. Its the moon structures that are important and shouldn't be burnt down in an afternoon for sake of fairness (so the defender can be allowed to defend moongoo extraction structures). But the citadels themselves only really allow docking convenience. And therefore should be way easier to kill (the vulnerability timer should be affected by tidi, at least, and possibly be less offensively strong and have fewer timers). If you think any of this is a bad idea you weren't there. EDIT: To have playable game you just need fewer calculations per ship. Right now there were hundreds of hundreds of ships with 3-5 flights of fighters each and up to 8 ewar modules each, and over 10 THOUSAND ships that could have ended up in the same system if the server allowed it. Its just simple, if this doesn't happen Eve is dead like a dodo not ""hurrdurr eve is dead daily post"" dead. as player count goes up server load per ship has to go down down DOWN. "

65,vulnerability,Eve,What if a Keepstar fight would be split up over multiple Systems similar to an Entosis fight ? And that way create a multitude of fights in different ship sizes.,0,7t46jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7t46jj/what_if_a_keepstar_fight_would_be_split_up_over/,2018-01-26 23:26:19,"We know that pushing a Structure over 6h in 10% tidi ain't fun and the fact that fighters bug out and don't apply dps doesn't make it any better. So i wondered what if the Keepstar Damage cap mechanics would be entirely different (maybe fortizar too) compared to other structures. Imagine Keepstars had 90% resist across the board. As soon as it gets shot during its vulnerability period ""nodes"" spawn in the constellation the keepstar stands in. Example given 6 nodes. These nodes can be directly attacked. They have 1.000.000 HP on their first Hull (0 resists) and another 1.000.000 on their second (99,9% resists). You can rep the first hull with both armor and shield reps. The status of the first hull represents 15% of the keepstars Resistances. So if a node is in 33% on the first hull that is a resistance reduction on the keepstar of 10%. Lets say if all nodes are 100% you need 30 minutes to bash a Keepstar layer at damagecap. If Resist are 0 (all nodes have no first layer left) this time would go down to 3 minutes. Ofc balance could be set here accordingly, this is merely an example. Now imagine the amount of skirmishes and small subcap fights all over the place we could have if we would fight over these nodes in order to keep resistances up or down depending on which side we stand. We would also stretch the fight over up to 7 systems which means 8000 attending players can be spread over many more servers instead of everyone joining the lagfest in the keepstar system. On top of that we also remove part of the Sit save tethered up mechanic as these nodes would mean committing fax machines on open grids without any support structures if you plan on not getting your keepstar pushed in 3 minutes. Bonus points: All of the sudden your Keepstar and Fortizar fights would be open to many more doctrines instead of just Capitals, Machariels etc. etc. but also your Jr. FC can be given a Ferox Fleet and have a vital role in defending or attacking the enemy Keepstar. tl;dr: A mechanic that would force Keepstar attackers AND defenders to spread out to nearby systems with the target to decrease individual server load (less tidi) and increasing risk vs. reward racio on both sides."
66,vulnerability,Eve,Citadel Mechanics Question,5,7t47c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7t47c5/citadel_mechanics_question/,2018-01-26 23:31:15,"TLDR; Can the owner of an unanchoring citadel CANCEL the unanchoring process, after having their citadel attacked during the initial unanchoring cycle? o7 everyone, first time CEO of a fledgling low class WH Corp here. I've never had more fun in eve, despite some of the mechanics of Corp and structure ownership. I've learned more about access lists and roles in the past month than I'd care to think about. I now have my next learning opportunity in the form of a hostile unanchoring citadel. My initial mistake was thinking that the timer counting down that said 'UNANCHORING' was the time until the citadel unanchored. After getting my guys stealthily staged into the hole to wait out the last 24 hours of the timer, I decided to do some research into unanchoring mechanics so I knew what to expect. Imagine my surprise when I found out that no one except the enemy Corp CEO knows the exact time of unanchoring, and the timer I can see is just the normal vulnerability timer. FUCK Now I've had eyes on the citadel since last weekend, so I know it has to be unanchoring *sometime* this weekend. However we are a small Corp and can't really cover the citadel across all time zones for the next couple days. This wall of text brings me to my question, if we attack the citadel in its vulnerability timer I know that the unanchoring timer will be reset. By ""reset"" does this mean another seven day timer, or to cancel the unanchoring process altogether? If the unanchoring timer is reset to 7 days, can the enemy CEO merely cancel the unanchoring process know that he knows his citadel is in jeopardy? Thanks everyone! I'm also willing to take any other tips on low class wormhole life or new CEO advice (I've already pulled all the shares from the master wallet so I have that going for me at least!). "
67,vulnerability,Eve,"""Designing for the Little Guy"": Phoebe, Citadels, and Malcanis' Law",92,7tfyos,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7tfyos/designing_for_the_little_guy_phoebe_citadels_and/,2018-01-28 09:05:10,"The oft-quoted Malcanis' Law states that **""Whenever a mechanics change is proposed on behalf of new players, that change is always to the overwhelming advantage of richer, older players.""** While I don't think this law holds 100% of the time, it's an instructive aphorism for game design. Whenever they make a change to benefit new or smaller groups, CCP (or any sandbox game designer), always need to ask themselves how older, larger groups will react to said change. In the last ~2 years, CCP has made a number of changes that, in whole or in part, were designed to help diversify nullsec and help new and/or smaller groups take space outside the confines of the major power blocs of the time: N3PL, DRF, and CFC. The major moves in that progression were Phoebe, Aegis, and Citadel. Phoebe and Citadel in particular come into contact with Malcanis' Law, with very different levels of success. Aegis is not universally loved, but its issues are more intrinsic to the system itself and less related to the big-vs-little divide. **Phoebe** The major feature of Phoebe from a nullsec perspective was jump fatigue. Designed to limit the ability of the major powers to quickly deploy caps and supers over a wide area, it instantly made the map ""larger"" and made the maintenance of far-flung empires much more difficult. For the most part, this has been successful. Null is a far more diverse place now than it was in late 2014. Capitals are used much more freely locally, and despite fatigue making local powers a bit too difficult to punish from outside the immediate area, Phoebe is generally regarded as a success. The primary complaint is the exponential blue timer, which is completely fair. An escalating timer of 30/60/120/200 minutes or similar would be much better, making rapid movement impossible but making it much less punishing to play the game and making deployment move ops much less cancer. **Citadel** Citadel brought us 2 major features for null: the capital rebalance and the titular citadels. The capital rebalance has been mostly well received. Eliminating near-infinite spider tanks was a good change. Remote reps are still powerful, but coming from FAX requires the FAX to be vulnerable in a way spider-tanking Archons and Aeons were not. Citadels, on the other hand, are widely hated. Damage caps were instituted to protect small groups from losing cits quickly. Repair timers are an awkward, contrived outgrowth of this, since the familiar damage vs reps race doesn't work with damage capped. Cits were kept cheap so that small groups could afford them, and given strong combat abilities to help small groups repel attacks from larger enemies. Timers were made more restrictive. Asset safety was introduced to make the loss non-catastrophic if they were overwhelmed anyway. So why did citadels fail while Phoebe succeeded? **Because citadel ""little guy"" mechanics were all focused on combat, and Phoebe wasn't.** There's simply nothing you can do to allow a smaller group to defeat a similarly skilled and committed large group in a straight up fight. Malcanis' law absolutely holds here. It's the nature of the sandbox, and you can't change that without resorting to things like player caps that are antithetical to the sandbox. If cits are strong, cheap, and TZ-tankable for the little guy, they're strong, spammable, and TZ-tanked right back at them (and each other) by the big guy. By contrast, Phoebe merely restricts the ability of caps to influence multiple regions on short notice. Little guys weren't doing that anyway, and it can't be turned back on them like cits can. **So, can we fix cits by learning from Phoebe? I think so, and here's how:** First off, we have to accept that a big group can kill a small group's cit with proper effort. No amount of damage capping, cit module changes, or vulnerability mechanics can change that. Post-Phoebe, moving away from an attacker you can't defeat is a fine alternative to offer smaller groups. If they commit to following you in force, they're sacrificing their presence somewhere else (see the last few weeks of no-super-umbrella Delve for an example of this). With that in mind, we also accept safety as a necessary evil. If we're going to accept citadels as destructible homes, we have to make losing them survivable as well. The fee isn't all that dissimilar to the losses of fire sale contacts. In return for that safety, cits need to lose any and all mechanics that currently strive to make them permanent. Anti-cap damage below a keep is nerfed to the ground, as is the bomb launcher. Cit scrams become point only, with the activation restrictions proposed in 2.0. In return cits get only ""soft"" force multiplier mods - a single target anti-cap neut, command boosts, weak AoE paints, damps, or weapon disrupts, etc. Basically, things that only have value if you field a competitive fleet. Damage caps are also removed and cits can now be directly repaired. Repair timers can stay, but are easy to pause and last the entirety of the vuln time for that layer. In essence, they only affect no-shows by the attacker. Want it repaired in 15 minutes, bring FAX. If FAX reps are too strong in this role, apply a structure specific penalty. This returns the focus of cit engagements to ship-to-ship combat instead of the current meta of one side fighting the cit and the other playing the world's worst tower defense game. This also sidesteps all TiDi- timer interactions and the problems they bring. Defenders may still select a 4-hour TZ for their armor and hull timers, but day of the week selection is gone. Shields are 24/7 vuln and armour comes out at vuln window 48-72 hours later, and structure 24 hours later. Unfueled cits lose a timer to combat spam and can now be safely bashed by caps thanks to the removal of cap killing weapons. This massively reduces the man- hours required to grind undefended cits since you no longer have to use an entire fleet of players in subs. Way TL;DR Phoebe mostly good, citadels mostly bad. Remove cap killer weapons, damage caps, and rep timers to refocus cit fights on ships. Accept that cits should be killable, and the answer is moving, not entrenching cits further."
68,vulnerability,Eve,Aegis Sov: A Review,206,7m83a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7m83a9/aegis_sov_a_review/,2017-12-27 01:42:46,"HELLO THERE REDDIT FOLK my name is Michael Wilmore and I am the sexiest, funniest, and most-endowed member of the corp Higher Than Everest [P3AK], formerly of The-Culture. Prior to that I was in Pandemic Horde where my appendages (!) compared just as favorably. &amp;nbsp; I am here today to talk to you about Aegis sov AKA fozzie sov AKA shitting into an open blender and having to clean up afterwards. I have participated on the ground in big sov campaigns like WWB, the Tribute war, and T-Cs evac from Fountain, as well as smaller-scale campaigns like Horde vs SS/INIT in Cloud Ring, T-Cs eviction of Soviet-Union from Fountain, and P3AKs recent campaigns against FCON and then RMC in Immensea. 1000 dudes, 500 dudes, 50 dudes, 5 dudes - Ive done it at all scales and often enough to feel that Im actually in a position to comment on it, even if Im no expert. &amp;nbsp; Today Im here to expand on on opinion Ive talked about in these illustrious halls before: fozzie sov is actually not shit. It has some absolutely appalling flaws, but they are relatively shallow - the guts of the system allow for engaging gameplay at all scales with plenty of scope for escalation and counter-escalation. But there ARE flaws and they ARE stupid, and without wanting to jump into GRRR CCP from the off, its ridiculous that some of them have not been fixed. For the attention challenged, heres the TL;DR: &amp;nbsp; - Nerf combat ceptors - Make active entosis ewar-immune - Nerf vuln windows so that there is more scope for cross-TZ interaction - Nerf offensive entosis timers in general so they are not so stupidly burdensome to attackers - Get rid of the TCU and halve the grind overnight - Make entosis feel cooler &amp;nbsp; Now the verbiage. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **TO BE THIS GOOD TAKES AEGIS** &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Fozzie-sov is actually pretty ambitious if you look at what its trying to do. Its attempting to provide a sov-war experience that is functional and engaging for as many players, play-styles, and play-scales as possible, while at the same time alleviating some of the gameplay problems caused by Eves unavoidable technical limits as a non-instanced game. It is a condensed response to years of criticisms and suggestions regarding sov war, and its aims are really laudable. In fact, to put it more strongly, I think any sov system that replaced aegis would have to achieve all of these aims as well, or it would definitely be seen and felt as a step backwards. Its also important to note that it mostly achieves these aims: &amp;nbsp; - A lot of people go around claiming that because huge coalitions exist, fozzie-sov failed. This is dumb. Aegis wasnt intended to solve human nature. In a political sandbox, coalitions will gather strength, fight, collapse, disperse, rinse &amp; repeat (and I would argue this happens more often now than it did, but thats a separate debate). But aegis does allow smaller entities to contest sov, even against larger entities. I know because Ive spent the last 6 months doing it. It also allows entities with less income and SP to play the sov game in a way that doesnt feel totally out of scale. Does more SP, income, and sheer size help or even tip the scales? Yes, obviously, but Ive seen all-T1 entosis contests between small groups, and Ive gone with my corp to evict alliances significantly larger than us, both in characters and actual fleet-sizes. With NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS GRRR CLAWS MORE ON THIS LATER, the mechanics do actually scale well, with everything from T1 frigs to capitals being able to play a seamless part in a fozzie-sov contest, along with bloc FCs and skirmish commanders. Maybe you havent experienced it, but it IS possible and DOES happen. The existence of coalitions doesnt change that and is an entirely separate thing. &amp;nbsp; - The distributed nature of the fight also means you get lots of different doctrines and comps intermingling even in a single event, because holding a single grid isnt the only objective in play. I remember during the Tribute war how cool it was to see supers, T3Cs, T3Ds, covops recon entosis and interceptors all in play for a single ihub event, occupying different roles and pursuing different objectives across the constellation. Its actually really interesting and multi-faceted, and I think with some small changes to the overall meta you could see a lot more fleet concepts come into play. &amp;nbsp; - Even under heavy pressure, distributed node events are way less aids than any of the single-grid events out there, including modern citadel fights. This is good, because it means you usually dont face the prospect of divorce as you sit on a grid for 7 hours in maximum tidi. &amp;nbsp; So these are good things that aegis successfully accomplishes, and its really, really important not to lose sight of that. Any replacement for aegis would HAVE to do these things, and any iteration would have to retain these improvements. But there are major problems, and I want to go through them here in order of how terrible they are. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **CANCER DOCTRINES: THE EWAR-CLAW META** &amp;nbsp; *1. Claws* &amp;nbsp; We all know that aegis has been defined by claws, to the point where the fozzie-claw is a bitterly-named doctrine and Gobbins literally called them the new dreads. The thing is, this isnt bad per se; if arty claws offered fun and engaging gameplay then it would be fantastic that they were the ultimate force in the meta. &amp;nbsp; The problem of course is that they dont: they arent fun to fight with, or to fight against. They are a cheap, disposable doctrine that is simultaneously the most effective and most risk-averse fleet comp you can bring to an entosis contest. They dont require skill to FC (source: Im shit, and I have done this) or to fly (take fleet warp, lock &amp; alpha, repeat), and due to their disposable nature whether you live or die you dont get any SENSE OF PRIDE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT from using them. And from the other side, your opponents find you almost impossible to engage, and even if they manage it (i.e. you fuck up and feed), all theyve got are a handful of claw killmails for probably hours of grind. This satanic ritual reaches its climax when you have an entosis contest in which 2 claw fleets warp around killing node toasters and never engaging each other. I have seen this hell, and it is shit gameplay for everyone no matter who wins. &amp;nbsp; The thing is, I dont think the problem lies with the mechanics of fozzie sov so much as it does with claws in particular, and combat ceptors more generally. A fozzie-claw can have 3.3k ehp whilst doing over 1k alpha and aligning in under 2s, all while being bubble-immune and warping at 8au/s. Got 20 guys in claws? You have 20k alpha. 50 guys? 50k alpha. They scale in an unbelievably raitarded way, and will delete most entosis doctrines even at relatively modest numbers. The issue isnt quite so pronounced with other combat ceptors (which take more than 1 second to do 1k damage...), but due to their speed and interdiction nullification they will usually have plenty of time to reach and apply their DPS to toasters. Should a 40m ship that you can sit in after 40 days be able to instawarp, do &gt;1k alpha, and warp at 8au/s, all while being interdiction-nullified? I dont think so. Honestly, even putting aside the context of aegis, combat ceptors seem really overpowered - fozzie-sov just puts it into telescopic focus. A lot of the worst aspects of aegis would be remedied if it made sense to bring doctrines that it hurt to lose, that could be engaged, and that were designed to be on grid with another fleet. &amp;nbsp; Solution? &amp;nbsp; From time to time you see suggestions like making ceptors vulnerable to hictor bubbles etc, but I really dont like these ideas because honestly, I think tackle-ceptors are in a pretty good place right now. They help fights to happen rather than be avoided, and thats what we need more of in the game. Nullification and high warp-speed arent problems until theyre paired with large amounts of damage and insta-warp abilities. You also want to avoid nerfing too many other playstyles for the sake of sov-null; it would be shit if combat ceptors just got agility or damage nerfs. &amp;nbsp; So here is my suggestion: give interceptors a role bonus that allows them to fit a special high-slot interdiction nullification module. This module should have zero fitting requirements (to allow existing tackle/utility fits to survive), but have gross fitting penalties for turrets and launchers. In other words, if you want to be nullified, you have to be pretty toothless, and if you want to have teeth, you have to be more engageable. There may be issues with this I havent considered, and obviously it is fundamentally a nerf to ceptors, but I think its a fair nerf and one that would make fozzie-claws a lot less appealing for most alliances. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; *2. Ewar* &amp;nbsp; Right now a single cheap griffin can warp to a structure or node, get off a single jam cycle, and undo minutes of work for the entosis ship whilst risking almost nothing in the process. This is so stupidly unbalanced it makes my brain hurt. When Goons invaded Fountain earlier this year, we made it as aids as possible for them by warping griffins in to jam their entosis just as they finished their warm-up cycles. They would have 1-200 people sitting on the ihub, but we kept them there for hours despite never making any attempt to control the grid, because a single griffin jam was all you needed to undo their progress. This was a pretty effective attrition tactic, but it is also cheap, shitty gameplay and it shouldnt be in the game. Same goes for damps. If you want to stop a ship entosising, you should have to kill it or force it off the structure/node. &amp;nbsp; The solution here is pretty obvious IMO: an active entosis module should make you immune to ewar of this kind. I just dont see why zero-risk tactics should have such an outsized influence on important strategic objectives. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **DEFENCE IS STUPIDLY OP** &amp;nbsp; A bit like with Citadels, CCP stacked entosis mechanics heavily in favour of the defender. Unlike citadels, over 2 years later they have never revisited this or even indicated that they intend to, and that is unacceptable. &amp;nbsp; Obviously fighting on your own turf comes with lots of logistical and experiential advantages, and that is both inevitable and as it should be. In fact, probably the biggest buff to offensive entosis has been citadels, which allow alliances to use single-grid events in their TZ to improve their offensive logistics for future entosis events. Get an upwell structure down in your opponents constellation and you are in a far stronger position to contest sov. &amp;nbsp; But even this comes with a significant defensive advantage: in sov null, the anchoring period takes 24 hours longer per strategic index level. Fine, maybe that is a good thing. But as well see, at every turn defence is massively buffed or offence horribly nerfed, and the cumulative effect is a huge part of why people see entosis as such an intolerable grind. &amp;nbsp; Consider this: before you even think about creating a timer, the window in which you are able to try and do so is determined entirely by your opponent, and if the ADM is high then that window is incredibly narrow - just 3 hours at ADM 6. So if youre attacking an ihub outside your TZ, you have to be really organised and focussed just to engage with the structure at all. &amp;nbsp; Then when you get there, it takes an entire hour just to create a timer in an ADM 6 system. I am not aware of any other timer contest in the game that takes a minimum of an hour just to create; this seems like a ridiculous amount of time to have to spend given that your enemy presumably lives in the place you are toasting. If upon being notified, they cant bother to show up to the reinforcement in their own space during a window of their choosing after 30 minutes, then frankly they should have to fight the timer. I dont care how much spod someone mines, making attackers hold an uncontested grid for an hour just to create an event is disgraceful design and needs to be nerfed hard. &amp;nbsp; Cool, now youve made your ihub timer - so when is it? Oh, its any random point in time during the vulnerability window. Amazingly, this means that low-ADM timers outside your TZ can be worse than high-ADM ones, because even if you overlap with the tail end of the vulnerability window, reffing the structure then may still produce a timer at the beginning of the vulnerability window. And if its a high-ADM system, then having alarm-clocked to spend an entire hour holding a grid in your enemys space in their chosen TZ, at as painless an hour as possible, you can still get fucked by a timer thats 3 hours later/earlier than when you hit the thing. &amp;nbsp; Days later you arrive groggily at the keyboard, and prepare yourself for the final humiliation: having already held a grid for an hour in your enemys space in their chosen TZ, you now have to hold a minimum of 12 different grids for 24 minutes each. Even under ideal conditions you are talking about an hour. Meanwhile, the defenders only have to hold a minimum of 8 grids for 5 minutes each, and can plausibly wrap up the event in less than 15 minutes. &amp;nbsp; Finally, if the attackers win, they will have to anchor a new ihub and then entosis it and you guessed it hold that grid. &amp;nbsp; At no point is the contest ever on the attackers terms. At every point they are penalized relative to the defender. In an ADM 6 system, the attacker will have to spend a bare minimum of 2 hours holding grids to kill a single structure. The defender can spend as little as 10 minutes to win the same timer. And as outrageously disproportionate as those numbers are, they dont even tell the whole story, because in practice toasting a node for 5x as long is a LOT more than 5x as hard. &amp;nbsp; Solutions? &amp;nbsp; First of all, the minimum vulnerability windows need to be longer, at least 5-6 hours rather than 3 in my opinion. The game does not have enough players to have them walled off from each other to this degree. The reinforce itself should cap out at 30 minutes, and the timer should match when the reinforce began - not just be some random ass time the attackers have no influence on. The defenders are already getting everything on their terms, so the attackers should have some influence on when the event will occur (as they currently do with citadels). Nodes should also take less time for attackers; holding a grid for 24 minutes in order to make 5% progress is both outrageously unbalanced AND a crazy demand on a players time. You really shouldnt have to spend more than 15 minutes on a node, maybe not even that. &amp;nbsp; Basically, stop asking attackers to give their lives away just to get a fight. There is no part of Eve that is as unbalanced as current sovereignty mechanics are with respect to attack vs defence (and given that we have citadels in their current form, thats saying something). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **THE TCU IS FUCKING STUPID** &amp;nbsp; It does essentially nothing, takes just as long as everything else to kill, and costs less than a T2 entosis link. CCP, why do you ask us to spend hours of our lives interacting with this thing? I know the original intent was to allow people to dip their toes into the sov game without having to shell out for an ihub, but fucking hell, let those hipster assholes shell out for an ihub if they want local organic brew fozzie-toasted coffee. It definitely beats making everyone else spend hours grinding structures that do nothing and can be picked up in Jita for 130m. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **ENTOSIS LOOKS AND FEELS SHIT** &amp;nbsp; Entosis is arguably the single most important mechanic in sov null, and the link the most important module. This is how you plant your flag, build your space empire, and let the spice really flow. &amp;nbsp; So why does the link animation look so boring and shit? Its one of the most dull looking effects in the game, a pasty blue light coming from your ship that gently strokes the structure. If Im going to orbit an ihub for an hour just to create a timer, I ought to look fucking badass doing it. I should be shooting electric hacking death rays out of my ship like when Palpatine toasts Vader. If Im attacking, then those rays should be RED and SCARY. And could nodes maybe be a bit bigger and cooler so when they explode I actually get some kind of visual satisfaction? Maybe I could get some cool red electric damage effects like we get on ships? CCP, this is the key module in probably the most media-visible aspect of your game. Why does it look like a maypole ribbon? &amp;nbsp; Then if you ever finally do kill an ihub, youre not on-grid with it when it dies, and no KM is generated. P3AK killed well over 20 RMC ihubs in november/december, many of which were upgraded. Yet there is essentially no record of this, unless you are willing to do some horrible dotlan digging. If sov is so important, why doesnt it feel important? Why does my entosis ship warrant a KM, but not the structure it was killing? Maybe we could even get individual KMs for nodes like we do POS mods, so our best toasters can point to a string of dead nodes and say ""I did that"". Like, throw me a bone CCP. &amp;nbsp; Im not saying red electric rays of deathtosis and ihub KMs are going to make me feel good about spending an hour toasting an ihub at 10:30am, so that I can come back at 8:30am 2 days later and chase claws around. But by christ, it would be a start. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **CONCLUSION** &amp;nbsp; Reading over this, Im aware that probably the weakest bit of my argument is the first section, where I basically go NUH-UH to people who think fozzie-sov has done nothing for the little guy and inherently doesnt allow for engaging content. All I can say is that based on my experience, I disagree. However I also acknowledge that for a lot of people, this expression of aegis sov is unicorn-esque, and all they ever see are claws and griffins, stretching into the distance. Those are shit, and the attack/defence balance is shit, and those things need to be fixed. &amp;nbsp; But when I head out with Harvey and the boys, and we bridge in our rapiers and open up our entosis gear in chrome, I see a different version of fozzie-sov. I see a version where tight coordination and good intel-relaying allow you to out-play an opponent across a constellation. I see a sov system where small fleets can contest large fleets with asymmetric warfare and more SP and alts. I see a system where key gates and junctions become the focus of single-grid fights that cant be avoided, and have to be contested. I see a system where the motivation to undock is as classically Eve as anything else in the game: to kick over someone elses sandcastle. Who cares if you want the space? The point is that they want it. Thats what the game is about, and I think with some tweaks aegis could do it really well. &amp;nbsp; We just need to get that version of fozzie-sov to everyone, so theyre not stuck playing claws online for another 2 years. Please CCP, you need to look at this."

I have a static U210 to low in the wormhole I operate out of, I'm pretty adept at rolling the static to get a more favourable exit. On a few occasions now, I've been rolling the wormhole only for it to collapse before it even gets to a critical vulnerability. The only common factor to these incidents is that the U210 is within a few hours of it's natural end of life. The time it happened this morning, I was still 3 hours away from it's EOL (I bookmarked it myself yesterday within a few minutes of it spawning). There was no message saying that ""have you been trapped"" indicating it wasn't a mass calculation mess up, it just seems that trying to collapse a near EOL wormhole somehow triggers the natural collapse. Am i just incredibly unlucky with the wormhole dying at the at the exact 6 minute window that i'm rolling it? Are there some subtle nuances to the EOL / Mass mechanics that i've missed?"

We've been watching him for a while and we know that while he does man the station for his vulnerability timers he does not have any outside support and has been stockpiling drone loot in there for a while. Now the boys and I want to pop this pinata, but I'm totally unfamiliar with the new structure mechanics other than the basics. I'm trying to figure out whether this is even possible for our crew. There are six of us, myself and two others are decently skilled up but the other 3 are total newbros we brought into the game 2 weeks ago. The current fleet we were thinking of fielding would be an Abaddon (myself), a Talos, a stratios with sentries, two newbros in augorors for cap/armor logi, and a final newbie in some variety of tackle frigate. We also have a couple hauler alts that will be waiting in the wings to scoop the loot. How much dps can a manned Astrahus put out, and to how far? Is it possible to protect our logi from it, or is he just gonna focus those down? How strong is the neut potential? Is there anyway to check its fitting/cargo? And finally, is there anything I'm forgetting that I should know about? Thanks my dudes."

74,vulnerability,Eve,Upwell Reinforcement 2.0 - Actually even worse than 1.0 in almost every aspect,359,7pg50a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7pg50a/upwell_reinforcement_20_actually_even_worse_than/,2018-01-11 02:07:26,"The preliminary Upwell 2.0 system is now on TQ (not SISI), and it's not pretty. The primary concerns about the 1.0 system were centred around timezone tanking and time to kill, which this new system is attempting to address. I'm only talking about the timers themselves in this post, and am not going to address concerns regarding creating those timers / fighting on the grid for those timers. All this information is available in game, by looking here URL and mousing over the (?). #In 1.0 Vulnerability windows of varying sizes exist across the week within which you can hit various Upwell structures, and the final timer will match the timer of the initial reinforce +7 days. There will also be a secondary timer 1 day after initial reinforce. For example, an Athanor would have 20 hours of vulnerability a week in which you can create the intial timer, and thus 20 hours of possible final timers 7 days later. The spread of the hours are determined by the defender but the attacker can determine exact time within that spread. For Athanors this works reasonably well, the problem lies with structures like Astrahuses which only have 3 hours a week within which the attacker must commit. #In 2.0 The exact vulnerability windows are still unclear for the initial timer, so we cannot comment on that yet. However after the initial timer is created, the second timer will be at an hour chosen by the defender, regardless of when it was attacked. This second timer will be between 24 and 48 hours after the initial reinforcement, at the exact hour chosen. Pretty bad, but at least this timer gets skipped if the structure has no online service modules. If the attacker succeeds the second timer, or the structure had no online service modules, we get to the final timer. This is where it gets **really bad**. The final timer will be on an exact day (singular) and hour (singular) chosen by the defender and will repair after 15 minutes. The final timer will be at least 3 days long in nullsec, and at most 10 days (6/15 in highsec, 1/8 in wh) from the previous timer. Every single citadel in the game could be timed to the same 15 minutes in a week. I'm going to say that again just so you think about the ramifications. **Every single citadel in the game could be timed to the same 15 minutes in a week**. I'm posting this now because there is still a chance it can be changed, but it's already on TQ in this form so make your voices heard if you don't like it. #Examples Under the current system an Athanor can be killed in 20 hours of a week, hours chosen by the defender, exact 15 mins chosen by the attacker. Under the new system an Athanor could be killed in exactly 15 mins of a week, chosen by the defender. Under the current system an Astrahus can be killed in 3 hours of a week, hours chosen by the defender, exact 15 mins chosen by the attacker. Under the new system an Astrahus could be killed in exactly 15 mins of a week, chosen by the defender. ____________________________________________ Upwell 2.0 example case attacking an Athanor with it's vulnerability set to 1000 Wednesday: If we assume best case for initial timer creation (perma vulnerable), and I reinforce an Athanor with an online drill with my alliance at 2100 on a Saturday night. Armor timer is 1000 on Monday, for 15 mins. (1 day 13 hours) Structure timer is 1000 on Wednesday a week later, for 15 mins. (9 days from armor, 10 days 13 hours from initial) Is that better in any way than what we have now? I think not, even assuming best case of vulnerability. #Closing Currently on TQ on the proposed system is *significantly* worse than the current system with regards to concerns raised, for the reasons outlined above. With some tweaks it could work, but the tweaks need to be done fast considering these are supposed to be the tweaks we've been asking for for over a year in the first place."
75,vulnerability,Eve,A Noobs Idea on fixing EVE,0,7pkqmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7pkqmv/a_noobs_idea_on_fixing_eve/,2018-01-11 13:00:27,"So just a bit of backstory, I only played EVE for a month or so but I've been on this Reddit for around a year. Also this is my first post! MY FIXES 1: Citadels: what if CCP made it so that the timers reflected how many citadels were in a solar system (or region? not to sure on the different sizes of space) Ex: Lets say there's only 1 structure in a system, then make it so it has a vulnerability timer of 15min and can only be attacked 6 hours of the week (not to sure how the timing system works) But lets say there's 20 citadels in a system, then each of them have a vulnerability timer of 8 hours and can be attacked 48 hours a week I would think that this would prevent citadel spamming and make them easier to kill. But it would also benefit small corps as it would make their citadels harder to kill. While larger entity's would place more because they can defend more. 2: UI: Why not just make it so that there's different versions of it? Basically if you liked the UI back in 2007 then you could download it and use that one. But if you liked the UI in 2016 you could use that instead (only problem i see with this it might take to much work to implement) 3: SOV space: (I never went into null when I played but I learned about it through Reddit). I have two ideas for this: 3.1: What id SOV space was determined by if you had a structure in it or not? If not its just empty. And if theirs two or more structures the oldest one is who's space it is. Only problem I see with this is that people who own a lot of space could have an enemy fleet sneak in and cause havoc, so this method is more for the small guy 3.2: Have a new type of structure that's extremely expensive to make and when placed the SOV in that group of stars (I think its called a solar system?) goes to who ever placed it except like in the previous idea if another entity places a structure (not the new structure, just a citadel or something) then that specific system (just 1 star) is controlled by that alliance. Also there could be a structure that worked for entire regions but that might be a little bit to excessive. So in the end after looking over my points, I would think that it would get rid of krabbing, when you had a giant fight people would get killmails and the victor would get SOV space and everyone could have the UI they wanted! edit: just fixing the spacing"
76,vulnerability,Eve,ESS Idea - what if it was *required* in null,1,7q85c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7q85c5/ess_idea_what_if_it_was_required_in_null/,2018-01-14 10:31:12,"Handling major amounts of blue borders is no easy feat, botters gonna bot, and citadels aren't going to be changed drastically for the better soon. So a different approach. ##What if the ESS was required in any null sec system to claim bounties at all? * 100% of the bounty value goes into the ESS, 0% to the pilot. (perhaps some to the pilot with higher military index) * The ESS shows publicly and to the whole system its current contents * A pilot in a non-capsule within 20km can initiate distribution. After 15 minutes on grid, either the payouts go to the rightful owners, or are taken as tokens as currently. Note: 15 minutes timer even for ""rightful"" distribution. * Any bounties earned after a 15 min timer *starts* will not be distributed on that timer. The aim here is simple: make it more wasteful than at present to simply run away when hostiles come into system, and give time for both attacker and defender to assault the objective. 15 minutes (a typical novice FW plex timer, given NPCs) means that the ISK in there isn't constantly being shared out, so an appreciable level of cash is on the line for the people at home. Even having a character permanently sat on it, pushing out the cash, there will on average be 7.5 minutes worth in there. It's reasonable to expect some systems will have people less vigilant and thus more available to pilfer. Longer than 15 minutes, and the attacking force is spending too much time in one spot forcing a fight that's clearly not coming. If the system is guaranteed to have the people run off and stay off in fear, a single person is all that's required to nick the cash. If they may attack, you have a fight. For the defenders, they have their increased payout and relative lack of population in null, plus all the other niceties around. No vulnerability windows or multi stage timers across multiple days. Basic harassment. By making the ESS required, and holding all the bounty credits, it ensures there is (in any currently active system) something to take. How off the mark am I?"

I want to get my own station for compressing ore. I intend to put it in a High Sec system with lots of asteroid belts but slightly far away from major trade hubs and without any other chances of compression there.

I intend to buy an Athanor, though I'm also considering a Raitaru since it's a lot cheaper (if the main purpose is to use it for ore compression, does it matter much which I get?). So, what I'd like to ask is the following: 1: What would be a proper fitting? 2: How do I transport it from the system where I buy it to the system where I want it? It doesn't seem to have a ""packaged volume"" as far as I can see when looking at its info 3: How do I know if I'm allowed to set up in a certain system? 4: During the vulnerability state, can the whole station get destroyed or just one ""health bar"" (shields, armor, hull) for each vulnerability period? 4.5: If it is limited to one ""health bar"" per vulnerability period, can I somehow move it or package it or something to save the station if I think it'll get continued damage next period? If it can be completely destroyed in one period, is there a way to save it when it's under attack? Thank you very much in advance. I hope some of you experienced players can help out a noob here =)"

They can be placed anywhere, have no limit, have infinite storage space, have infinite docking space, have vulnerability timers, and have enough EHP to make most people not even care. And the entry price is about 1 billion. A bill ISK for your very own safe place, no wonder they're everywhere. People keep on suggesting ways to limit them or making them more expensive, but there's an underlying problem here. What's the points behind citadels again? * Everybody has a chance at having a structure. * Replaces the aging POS and Outpost systems. The first point is immediately why we can't make citadels more elusive: how can anyone get into the structure game if they're too expensive and there's not enough space? But it itself is only a problem because of the second one. What part of replacing both is a problem? Now, obviously, having Upwell structures take over POS functions (like reactions, compression, and moon mining) isn't what we're looking at here, because that's fine. The problem here is scale. Outposts are huge Alliance assets (and weren't too cheap when you actually had to buy them and place them down), that requires similar forces to controlling a system to take over. They were originally meant to be bashed (a part of the design that was quickly abandoned) and therefore were likely meant to have lots of health, you had (had, because you can't replace them, but it was originally there) a few choices in what functions it had, and it they have infinite item and ship hanger space. They have practically no upkeep. They have certain vulnerability timers to prevent them from being taken unfairly. POSes, meanwhile are made piecemeal from a number of rather cheap structures, and probably would have been everywhere if there wasn't a ""only at moons, one per moon"" limit. They don't have a lot of EHP (well, compared to citadels, can't use a 1000dps Oracle on a citadel, can you?), must put together their functions from scratch, and have limited vulnerability capabilities. They have limited space for assets and drops everything like fancy pinatas when they die. Obviously, of the two, Upwell structures are much more like Outposts. But CCP is trying to have it cover both markets at once, with no limits on how many can exist and a price between the two. The result is an easily spammable class of structures that makes space a clusterfuck. And yet, it also raises the bar to having your own structure: by Amarr prices, a small control tower and a few guns would only cost me over 90mill. 90mill! Where's the Upwell equivalent, CCP? By trying to cover both Outposts and POS markets, Upwell structures fail to accommodate the original promises of both systems. Solo players and small-corp players have to raise over a billion just for the base structure of their own (let alone the cost of the fit!), while multi-billionares can drop these valuable Alliance assets like candy. While Upwell structures need to be moved upwards in cost and limitations, CCP must also provide new, small structures that take the POS's place in modern EVE. These should continue to fulfill the Upwell paradigm of single, ship-like structures that act like stations, with fair vulnerability timers, but should be much less expensive with a fair EHP to match, have limited space to hold assets, have limited defense capabilities, have no asset safety, and generally be of limited protection to you and your assets and services. ***Optionally, also*** make their construction piecemeal from many structures (but still have the final result be a single structure), allowing it to capture the same feel of POSes and the NPC structures that sometimes pop up in combat sites and missions (I want a purely decorative field of barren asteroids permanently putting my structure into shadow, dammit). Once such structures are in the pipeline, Upwell can reveal that they were secretly handling most of their structures' construction and maintenance to make them look more affordable than they actually were or something."

As some of you will have seen, the new Refineries and Moon Mining are available for testing on our test server Singularity and we are actively gathering your feedback in[the forums](URL In this devblog, we will be giving you a bit more information about the structures themselves, the new rigs that will influence their performance and also introduce the Scheduler, which you use to set and initiate Moon Mining extractions. All of these additions to New Eden will be released in the[Lifeblood Expansion](URL October 24th 2017. ##Upwell Consortium delivers the third line of Structures: Refineries## Just as the[Engineering Complexes](URL diversity to the specialization of structures with their bonuses to Manufacturing and Science, and Citadels continue to be indomitable strongholds throughout New Eden with their combat focused hulls, the new Refineries stake their claim as the exclusive locations for both Moon Mining and Reactions activity, as well as the favored facilities for Reprocessing with their bonuses in these functions. As with both the Citadels and the Engineering Complexes, Upwell has seen to keep some of the existing systems. As such, the key similarities between all Upwell Structures are: * All Upwell Structuresuse the same vulnerability, reinforcement and damage cap system for defense. The damage caps for each size of structure remain the same whether that structure is a Citadel or Engineering Complex or Refinery * All Upwell Structuresuse the same asset safety system for recovering contents when destroyed or unanchored * All Upwell Structuresuse the same access list system for managing access to the structure and its services * All Upwell Structuresare dockable and include tethering for nearby friendly ships. * All core functions like refitting, repair, insurance, contracts and direct trade are available in all lines of structures. Some of the major differences between the classes of structures are: * Each type of Upwell Structure hull is bonused to a different strength: * Citadels gain bonuses to combat rig strength and Citadel service module fuel use * Engineering Complexes gain bonuses to manufacturing/science jobs and engineering service module fuel use * Refineries gain bonuses to reprocessing and are the only structures that can be used for Moon Mining orto run Reactions * Both the Medium Refinery (Athanor) andthe Large Refinery (Tatara) will require 20 hours of vulnerability weekly * Medium Refineries allow docking of subcapital and Freighter vessels, the same as their Citadel and Engineering Complex counterparts * Large Refineries share the same docking restrictions as Medium structures but will also allow the docking of Rorquals. No other capital ships can be docked at these structures. ##Deployment## With the release of the Upwell Refineries, Reactions (of all types) and Moon Mining will become exclusive to these new structures and they will no longer be performed in Player-Owned Starbases (POSes). Details about the changes to Reactions and the Service Modules that will perform these functions can be found in this[devblog](URL Moon Mining will be exclusive to Refineries when they are deployed in the Moon Mining Location around a viable moon. Full details about this process were listed in this[devblog](URL but to summarize, here are the key points: * Refineries can be deployed in all regions of New Eden, including High Sec and Wormhole space. All Upwell Structures are built and deployed in the same way, with the same deployment location restrictions (not allowed in certain newbie or trade hub systems, must be placed at least 1000 km from other Upwell structures). However, the Moon Mining Drill Service Module cannot be fitted in a Refinery that is not in a valid Moon Mining location. * Every viable moon (every moonin Low Sec and Null Sec space with a few exceptions for the very large moons) now has a specific Moon Mining location.These locations are a new warpable option in the right-click and radial menus for moons: Warp to moon mining location * Only one Refinery can be deployed within 250km of the Moon Mining Location and extract moon ores from that moon * When deploying a Refinery, the UI will inform you if you are in a valid location, if you are in a valid location but cannot moon mine, or if you are in an invalid location: [image](URL When the designs for Refineries were first being fleshed out, we knew that tying a single structure to a single moon would amplify some of the combat issues that face other Upwell Structures. With valuable input from the CSM and the feedback they have sourced from the Community, we will be using the introduction of these structures to make a change to thevulnerability of ALL Upwell Structures: * When an Upwell Structure is first deployed, it will enter an initial 15-minute vulnerable state (with the same repair timer mechanics and damage caps) before entering the 24 hour Anchoring state. * Once anchored, the vulnerability of the structure will match the Vulnerability windows set by its owners. This will mean that keeping control of the area in which you are planning to deploy your structure is paramount. Further changes to the Vulnerability and Combat systems of all Upwell Structures are now underway and some early details about these upcoming changes can be found in the [EVE Vegas Keynote](URL As with all Upwell Structures, the new Refineries will be able to fit all the standard Standup Service Modules, allowing their occupants access to services ranging from Clone Bays to Manufacturing and the other basic services this line includes. ##Athanor (Medium)## [image](URL **Role Bonus:** **2%** bonus to refining yield for all variants of Ore and Ice **20%** reduction in Reprocessing and Reaction Service Module fuel consumption Slot Layout: 3H, 3M, 1L, 3 Service, 1 Launcher Fittings: 1,200,000 PWG, 15,000 CPU Defense (shields / armor / hull): 4,800,000 / 4,800,000 / 4,800,000 Resistances (EM/Therm/Kin/Exp): 20 / 20 / 20 / 20 DPS Cap: 5000 Fighter Slots: 0 Tubes Weekly vulnerability hours:20 Capacitor (amount / recharge / cap per second): 100,000, 3600s, 27.8 Max Locked Targets: 8 Docking allowed for: all subcapital ships, freighters The required materials for building an Athanor are: | Structure Construction Parts| 1| |:-|:-| | Structure Hangar Array| 1| | Structure Storage Bay| 1| | Structure Repair Facility| 1| | Structure Reprocessing Plant| 3| | Structure Docking Bay| 1| | Structure Electromagnetic Sensor| 1| | Structure Acceleration Coils| 1| **At current market prices this represents a build cost of approximately 1.1 billion ISK(price is subject to capsuleer market fluctuations).** ##Tatara (Large)## **[image](URL **Role Bonus:** **4%** bonus to refining yield for all variants of Ore and Ice **25%** reduction in Reprocessing and Reaction Service Module fuel consumption **25%** reduction in time requirements for reaction jobs "

I don't think everyone knows how this goes down, a couple of people were interested which is why I am doing a dirty, unorganised write-up. There were things that went well, things that could have gone better, and I'll add some advice on how you can defend yourself against his as a player with a real life or how you can do it yourself. ^This ^is ^probably ^going ^to ^be ^very ^boring ^for ^people ^that ^have ^lived ^in ^high-class ^space ^for ^a ^long ^time ^and ^have ^participated ^in ^real ^evictions. The decision to go on a 3-day adventure was rather spontaneous. Thanks to [tical](URL I've had the idea of evicting afk corps out of their holes a couple weeks ago (I've done so once in the past but did not continue), so I had already shipped some bashing VNIs into my structures. On Tuesday morning, I was about to roll the static in my C5 to do some krabbing, having replaced one of my dreads (after it got unspectacularly stolen 3 weeks ago). I jumped through, saw a bunch of structures and did not think much of it, until I noticed they belong to a corp in the oh-so-active [Soviet-Union](URL at which point I asked two friends if they would like to help with some fun AUTZ timers. They did, I quickly scanned a High-sec entry to my chain 2j from Amarr as the first timer was already starting in 90 minutes so time was of the essence. I only had one POS which was anchored in my own hole, and I made the decision to tear it down and anchor it in the C5 that we were attacking. Because of the amount of timers that we had to [hit and pause](URL I made the decision to leave my Phoenix in there later that day. The azbel and fortizar timers called for it as our subcap force was mediocre at best, and while being able to pause both timers it would have taken us over 2 hours for each of the timers every day. The only supplies I brought were stront for the dread, a backup scanning frigate, a rolling megathron, a HIC as well as 3 VNIs to hand out/use on my alts. My friends brought a VNI/bomber and a polarized oracle (a third came by in a capsule and I handed him a VNI). This may not seem like much in comparison, however that DPS was absolutely needed to pause timers and finish them in a time that doesn't make you want to slit your wrists. Without the Phoenix and the help I got this would obviously have been impossible. After rolling connections to other wormholes (one of them being No Vacancies home hole), the first day went by relatively smooth but mentally straining, as the setup and organization of the whole thing had to be figured out while we were busy pausing the timers. Scans of the vulnerable structures revealed that none but the fortizar posed a threat to our bashing commando. As such, I did not use my dread on it until an opportunity presented itself. From rolling into the hole to finishing the last timer, 7 hours had passed. The next day went by relatively uneventful. I saw an astero from the corp we were attacking jump the static so I rolled him out. After DT, comms revolved around the most recent lossmails in Bringing Solo Back and how nano drakes are totally becoming meta now ('It's just so strpmg!'). Thanks to VNI and Oracle, you can work on other things on your computer, make food, watch a movie while you contribute meaningful DPS. No wormhole sigs appeared during the day. 'I bet there's going to me a nullsec frig hole to some AUTZ lowclass corp tomorrow', I said jokingly. The morning of the final timer I found myself staring at a Q003 leading to SV5-8N and a Russian Thundersquad scanner coming and scanning down the entire hole. Roughly an hour before, TDSIN connected into the hole (which scared the shit out of me - just 2 or 3 guys in jackdaws could have ruined our day), but luckily, they must have deemed it not worth the trouble and rolled the connection away. Russian Thundersquad were mainly gatecamping the pipe in Catch and don't do wormhole things, especially in that timezone, however SV5 was still one of the more busy systems, being connected to HED-GP, right next to providence and part of the pipe that you will have to take to get to V-3 and GE- if you are coming from Keberz. As such it can get up to 3k jumps per day. I tried to roll it using the HIC for about 45 minutes but gave up shortly before downtime. The timers seemed to progress faster than the day before, and I decided to use my dread to speed up the fortizar drastically, and we managed to kill it before the azbel even came out of reinforcement. We were never on the citadels on time though - the first Astrahaus, 'Initial Base' dropped roughly 7 billion in loot, including 2 barghests that were fully faction fit. The ships that were worth something were flown to the POS, the shitty ones were launched into space and got us some nice killboard stats (well, not uMill). Some of the highlights of the found ships include salvaging tengus (pre-change, rigged for salvaging and T2 salvagers), mining hurricanes, Blockade runners with inertial stabilizers, no prop mod and missing low slots and a cargo rigged gnosis with full cargo lows that could hold 6km3. There were some other speciment that would warrant a talk with a therapist, but I did not think of saving them. We used our alts and mains to move all the ships to the POS - the timers weren't waiting for us but we easily paused them asthey were not the first thing that was on our minds at the time. We were also unable to fly all the ships. [Mistakes](URL were [made](URL The Azbel came out, we had managed to loot a decent amount already so felt pretty confident and wondered what it might drop. At about 10% of structure left, someone logged into the Azbel. After a couple of minutes my phoenix was starting to get slightly neuted (I had a fleet hangar full of cap boosters, cap refits etc etc). We were suprised to see him not using the bomb launcher, on the kill mail it was revealed to have had no ammo. We grabbed one of the sabres that dropped which stayed cloaked at a ping, aligned to the undock and ready to bubble it should the Azbel die or the person manning it undock. Soldier also grabbed a HIC - we then noticed that an AB higgs rigged Onyx without scram scripts was probably not the most useful thing right now. &amp;nbsp; The Azbel eventually died, and we were confident we could also finish the rest of the structures before too many assets could be evacuated. I lazily checked the killmail and start to mix hyperventilating and screaming when I see the faction dreadnought on it, followed by excited 'Link mail, link mail!' on comms. We were incredulous, as this was not what we expected to find undelievered in an Azbel in J-space, anchored by an inactive corp in a Black Hole that decreases the strength of stasis webifiers. Even though it did not drop, some other things did, so back to work. One peculiar circumstance was that we had, so far, not found much PvP ships except 3 sabres and a jackdaw. There were 7 ratting barghests, rolling and ratting battleships, plenty of haulers but nothing sizeable that you could use for home defense. The research-rigged raitaru of all places finally dropped a cerberus (it was #capstable) and a couple of smaller ships. The POS had over 80 ships in it's forcefield, and after the mail appeared on zkill we were worried that someone might lazily try to roll into us. Nothing happened, and when we tried to roll for a good K-space connection yesterday to grab and anchor an astrahaus (not anchoring one was by far the biggest mistake in all of this), we connected to one of krabMils farming holes just 2j out. We moved 1.500.000+ m3 just in items, and today repackaged and bundled up all the ships we got, after which we had to transport roughly 2.500.000 m3 to the nearest highsec. I left the majority of the fuel behind as it was simply too big to waste a run on it, and today a different corp can already make great use of this generous donation. There was one last timer, staggered from the rest of them, 2 hours before which I was able to see two members of the corp scan out the massed static using a proteus and astero. We rolled them out in 4 Passes, plenty of time for someone to hit dscan and see a battleship but apparently it was not to be. Moving that much m3 was incredibly annoying, moving was the worst part in this, Soldier knew what was coming as he had taken part in evictions before. Earlier tonight we managed to move every single ship out, including the Phoenix, the total loot haul is estimated at around 42b. URL I am so glad this is over. We are now free from J100328. Even as an afk corp, if these people had just staggered the timers of their multiple structures across the whole 7 days this would have been too much of an effort to consider. Or if they had put the vulnerability timers all on the Hour, making it difficult to form enough subcaps to pause every single one of them. Be mindful of your vulnerabilities if you want to keep your hole. Any form of unexpected difficulty usually makes 'normal' citadel shooters abort the mission as there are plenty of other citadels in the sea. For defending my C5, I brought in an orthrus which made quick work of part of the bashing ships threatening the structures I had anchored there. After killing 2 bombers and a Vexor they were never to be seen again. If you want to do something similar, make sure you have enough alts, scouts, hauler and most importantly - friends. You can organize everything, be the only logistics person, but once you are setup you will benefit a lot from being able to hand out ships to people willing to help, as this reduces the barrier of wanting to help you bash the structures in the first place. VNIs and Oracles are great relatively low SP afk ships that are popular for bashing. Fun fact: the first aborted Vehement, the smallest takedown of a faction capital ever, in theory the 26th faction capital that died and the second Vehement that was not intended to die as an insurance fraud. But yeah it was still a structure bash, I would have insured and died in that before the day was over lol. This is my first AAR, English is not my native language so I'd appreciate tips and corrections on my writing and style. I am about to fall asleep here but I promised this AAR would come today, I would have liked to improve the formatting but making real paragraphs doesn't work for me somehow. Thanks for reading! tldr: afk azbel gets bashed, some guys built a vehement in a black hole and loot fairy said no lol"

After the discovery of a critical issue with EVE Gate last week, weve decided to bring forward the retirement of EVE Gate to close a vulnerability, rather than invest further time on fixing the issue that could be better spent working to improve out websites in other areas. On Wednesday (September 27th), EVE Gate will be retired. This will of course mean that the web based EVEmail access that EVE Gate provides will also be retired on Wednesday, however we are investigating alternative solutions for providing EVEmail access outside the EVE Online client, as were aware of how important this access is to the Community. As part of the retirement of EVE Gate, significant efforts have been put into ensuring that EVE Portal, the mobile app for EVE Online, will be a reliable alternative for out of game EVEmail access going forward. Were aware that some pilots have been experiencing issues using EVE Portal, and we hope that these issues have now been resolved so that character status and EVEmail is accessible on your mobile device. In addition to this, in the coming months well be speaking with the EVE Community and the Council of Stellar Management to prioritise expansion of EVE Portal into a wider ranging companion app for EVE Online, so stay tuned for further information.

People do not do 0.0 pvp to fly around in ceptors (if you actually like that, I'm sorry for you). 3) EVE is about large fixed battles. Massive battles and thefts are what EVE is known for and should be encouraged. 4)Citadels are currently unbalanced, they are too easy to spam, too hard to counter and take down for their size Solutions: 1) Roll the TCU and IHUB into one structure under a new name (Sovreignty Management unit or some other name). Since TCUs dont do anything other than sovreignty on the map (and effect nothing other than POS fuel which are being phased out) there is no reason to have both. 2) SMU are attacked and defended as follows. a. Attackers entosis the structure for a set amount of time (making it vulnerable) b. Attackers do enough damage to bring shields or armor to 0 (roughly 2x base HP of Astrahus* revised ADM factor) c. Defender picks an RF timer (within a 4 hour window like Dominion) d. Attacker tries to reduce structure to 0 &amp; destroy it. Defenders try to prevent damage for 15 minutes for it to self rep) 3) Structures are changed as follows: a. 24/7 vulnerability b. Medium structures have one reinforcement timer c. No damage cap d. Bomb launchers can only be fitted to large and XL structures e. Point defense rig can only be fit to XL structures &amp; applies much greater effects (making drones/fighters more effective against M/L citadels) f. Void bombs are removed and replaced with a Rapid neut (20k GJ neuted, 1k sig, 2s cycle time) g. Entosis link can be used on a structure. Each successful cycle (of 5 or 10 mins) takes one module offline until entosisd back online. Modules affected are random. These should make it easier for people in nullsec to have fun (lets face it, the current meta is absolute cancer) while bringing back balance to the Meta."
86,vulnerability,Eve,Citadel Timer Ideer,0,74882f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/74882f/citadel_timer_ideer/,2017-10-05 00:45:48,"In my honest opinion Citadels and their vulnerability timers are a bit broken. Can we introduce a Structure, that is anchor-able in space and is used as the Central Timer Relay Link(CTRL?) that allows citadels to have their Vulnerability window. If somehow managed to be taken down, Citadels would then lose their vulnerability window. Why? It could be used as a way to balance citadel mechanics currently. Instead of attacking the problem of their extreme amount of time required to kill one because of the timers, this would help aid an attacker to invade. This still allows Citadels to have their broken reinforcement timers so the defenders have plenty of time to prepare, but this could help **slightly** to some of the Sov problems, and in my honest opinion, would still provide awesome content over a centralized structure that is valuable to the defenders. Some of the structures ideas could be it has a 2 Hour vulnerability window, which still helps the defender out. It could still have a DPS cap like a citadel. But it should only have 1 timer. Once the structure is dead, all Citadel Vulnerability windows in that system offline. Allowing other Time Zones to help Sov Grind. This could provide a significant boost to invading since citadels could be reinforced as such: AU tz reinforces Citadel A US tz reinforces Citadel B -now 2 citadels can be killed at the same slow rate per day(you know what I mean) or etc. I know I am beating a dead horse with all the ""Hey guis I has an ideer"" so my bad."
87,vulnerability,Eve,[Idea (probably a stupid one)] Abandoned citadels should decay over time!,516,74ad5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/74ad5u/idea_probably_a_stupid_one_abandoned_citadels/,2017-10-05 06:05:14,"*tl;dr: the title.* The other day I was coming back home from work and only a few blocks away I found myself looking at a really impressive house built probably a century ago, wich was in my very uninformed opinion an architectonic work of art, but completely decayed and in a state of complete abandonment, with clearly visible cracks on the brick walls, plants of various types and sizes trying to reclaim the building from human hands, and half the roof colapsed into the structure. This somehow got me thinking about the abandoned stargates, stations and other space buildings that serve as decoration to most PVE anomalies or missions in EVE, and how New Eden would look if a new end of times came by and cleared the skies of humans once again. The next thought was only one more step away... what if abandoned citadels decayed over time, to eventually become ruins at the mercy of intrepid explorers and pirates looking for forgotten riches stored in their hangars and deposits? With the upcoming Refineries, we are getting a new way to control who mines what in a very detailed ledger... why not use that same mechanic to keep track of when was the last time someone used a citadel? This could work like this (the values are completely arbitrary): - After 1 month of not a single soul being docked in the structure, it would lose its tether and automated repair of ships that aproach it. - In another month, it would lose its vulnerability window, being now exposed to attack at any given moment. - Another month and its shield generators would shut down (one less timer). - 1 more month and the structure, exposed to the vacuum of space, would slowly start recieving damage over time, finally bringing its armor to 0 after a month (second timer gone). - 1 months after having its structure exposed, all functionality would colapse and the process would be irreversible... we now have a Ruined Structure that can be hacked or salvaged part by part, to obtain rare salvage components or even find a container with ships or modules left behind by their previous owners. At any time during this 6 months period, if any capsuleer with docking rights docks in the structure, the life support systems come back online, the citadel ""wakes up"" and the automated systems reverse the process, going one step back of the decay process each 24 hs. This would not only give some kind of long term solution to structures being dropped all over the place and then abandoned by their owners, but would also create a pretty cool posibility to all scavengers out there. I know, I'm probably delusional or something, but I'm stuck at work just waiting for something and wanted to share this crazy line of thought I had the other day."

90,vulnerability,Eve,Citadel Timer Changes (A small-group wormholer),4,7519la,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/7519la/citadel_timer_changes_a_smallgroup_wormholer/,2017-10-08 22:51:36,"TL:DR - Set the third timer for a specific day/time instead of an arbitrary X days after second timer. I have some mixed feelings about the citadel timer changes. Yeah, starting a Citadel bash or eviction at some ridiculous hour is kind of annoying. Yes, when vulnerability timers are spread out across an entire week, killing them can make for a rather long op. If you're in a major wormhole corp/alliance getting rid of the small guy is easier when the structures are always in vuln. I'm also a fan of the post below by StainGuy: URL I agree that trolling is going to be easy. Let's face it, if you're in a wormhole and there's no activity... what do you do? You shoot the structure if it's in vuln and see who shows up to defend it. But... that's not the big problem I have. Today, wormhole citadels drop all of their loot when popped. A well stocked small time corp becomes a loot pinata. If you've got friends or some isk you can pay for defense... yeah yeah yeah... This is not what bothers me. Small time groups aren't always active during the week in sufficient numbers to mount a reasonable defense. Great for those doing the eviction, but that also dictates when the owner of a structure sets their vulnerability timer. This makes it so someone doesn't remove a structure and all their assets during, for example, the work week... because some of us have day jobs. In nullsec, the propostion of extending the delay between second and third timers is not a bad idea as a whole... but i'm not a fan of setting it to an arbitrary X number of days delay. What if the third timer was on the day and time (or primetime) of the owner? This ensures that it's defensible by the owner's group... or at least at a time they thought it would be defensible. It'd be nice if CCP_Fozzie read this. It'd also be nice if people stopped giving him shit. He's not going to please everyone 100% of the time. "

It is my belief, that even after the upcoming changes and iterations to citadels, that citadels will continue to be the leader of stagnation and content destruction within the game. CCPs latest announcements at Eve Vegas has included the progressive changes to increasing vulnerability and requiring fuel. These changes have been praised by much of the community at large however I feel much more can be, and must be done. Since their introduction, my number one, my absolute biggest grievance with citadels is that unlike POSs, their anchor points are infinite. Unlike Citadels, POSs used moons as anchor points. Consequently, because there are a finite amount of moons per system, POSs cannot be spammed to the degree they are today. Historically, POSs marked territory in wormhole space, and apart from SBU/IHUBs, they also marked a degree of control in low and 0.0. The elimination of finite anchor points and introduction of infinite anchor points means that no longer are groups competing for space and territory. No longer are groups deciding should their POS (Or citadel/EC/Refinery), should serve as a stronghold, manufacturing center, or moon goo harvester. No longer is there motivation to expand and conquer. Groups in eve should bash each others heads in to compete for and build their sand castles; not burn another 2000km in line with their keepstars to do so. Mandating that Citadels be anchored to moons prompts groups in eve to make a decision. What kind of Structure do I anchor here? And in doing so, it begs the question: Why cant I have all 3? Why cant I have more? The answer is: of course you can, go find another moon, go eliminate someone elses Citadel and plant your own.

Unfortunately though this also creates major problems for more casual groups, who will now be under constant pressure to form fleets to defend, with the attacker having to only put in minimal effort to generate an armour timer. --- What this means is that attackers will be able to keep poking the shield and creating armour timers and forcing the defenders to form up fleets even if they have no intention of attacking them. --- This will of course lead to boring gameplay, as the best tactic for the attackers will be to poke the shield every other day until the defenders dont form up, or only form up a small fleet due to being demoralised by the trolling attacks. --- The consensus has always been that Sov Null requires big groups with minimal security mechanics to protect players, and then as you go up in sec status to high sec the game caters for more casual players to enjoy the eve experience without being required to login daily. --- In the proposed system, the defenders will need to ensure they can form a fleet every other day in order to keep the service modules running, which will be impossible for a casual group like mine which is based in high sec, and so structure ownership will firmly be in the hands of big groups from NS to HS. --- Below is a typical example of how many times you will have to expect to form up to defend an armour timer against an attacker who is trolling the shield timer over a two week period. --- **Current Vulnerability - (defence 24 hours after Initial attack and 2 days after subsequent failed attacks)** (Day1) Mon 00:00 (1st Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day2) Tue 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (1st Armour Timer) (Day2) Tue 02:00 (2nd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day4) Thu 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (2nd Armour Timer) (Day4) Thu 02:00 (3rd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day6) Sat 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (3rd Armour Timer) (Day6) Sat 02:00 (4th Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day8) Mon 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (4th Armour Timer) (Day8) Mon 02:00 (5th Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day10) Wed 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (5th Armour Timer) (Day10) Wed 02:00 (6th Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day12) Fri 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (6th Armour Timer) (Day12) Fri 02:00 (7th Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day14) Sun 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (7th Armour Timer) --- An attacker will almost certainly be able to make you form 7 times every two weeks without any problem, or once every 2 days. Once the defenders are demoralised or unable to login, then the attacker will launch the actual assault on the armour and render the structure offline and effectively useless. --- The prospect of being able to mount a proper defensive effort once every other day is well outside the realm of possibility for any casual to medium sized group and so will completely kill a lot of content that would otherwise occur. --- To compound this issue, it is very easy for the attacker to leave only 24 hours for the defender to form up for the armour timer. For a big alliance they can easily rage ping people, so this is not a problem. For more casual groups in HS and LS, 24 hours is not long when most players are working a FT job during the week. --- One solution which would be very simple to implement, would be to add a period of invulnerability after each failed timer, and extend the minimum period between the shield and armour timers. The length of this period could be based upon the sec status in which the structure is located. --- This would not only help more casual groups, but would also minimise the effect of trolling attacks on larger groups, so would be a win/win for everyone. After all we dont need more unfun trollceptor type mechanics introduced into the game. --- Attackers would still be able to poke the shield, although not at the same frequency, as if they fail to show up for the armour timer afterwards, then they would have to wait for a period of time for the shield to become vulnerable again depending on the security status. --- As an example, I would suggest adding a period of invulnerability of 7 days for HS, 5 days for LS, and 3 days for WH/NS; and a minimum period between shield and armour timers of 24 hours for NS/WH, 48 hours for LS, and 72 hours for HS. --- This would create a much better situation for both attackers and defenders, and would promote actual fights at the timers, rather than continuous troll attacks on the shield until the defender is demoralised (because this will definitely happen). --- To illustrate an example of what a revised vulnerability schedule could look like is below for the relevant security status. --- **High Sec - (defence 72 hours after Initial attack and 11 days after subsequent failed attacks)** (Day1) Mon 00:00 (1st Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day4) Thu 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (1st Armour Timer) (7 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day11) Thu 02:00 (2nd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day15) Mon 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (2nd Armour Timer) (7 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day22) Mon 02:00 (3rd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day26) Fri 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (3rd Armour Timer) --- **Low Sec - (defence 48 hours after Initial attack and 9 days after subsequent failed attacks)** (Day1) Mon 00:00 (1st Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day3) Wed 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (1st Armour Timer) (5 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day8) Mon 02:00 (2nd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day12) Fri 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (2nd Armour Timer) (5 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day17) Wed 02:00 (3rd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day20) Sat 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (3rd Armour Timer) --- **WH / NS - (defence 24 hours after Initial attack and 5 days after subsequent failed attacks)** (Day1) Mon 00:00 (1st Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day2) Tue 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (1st Armour Timer) (3 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day5) Fri 02:00 (2nd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day7) Sun 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (2nd Armour Timer) (3 Day Failed Attack Invulnerability) &gt;&gt; (Day10) Wed 02:00 (3rd Shield Timer) &gt;&gt; (Day12) Fri 01:00 - 02:00 (Prime Time) (3rd Armour Timer) --- **TLDR - Under the current system, you will have to defend an armour timer once every two days to keep your structure online, and will have only 24 hours to organise a defence fleet. The solution proposed is to add a period of invulnerability after each failed timer, and extend the minimum period between the shield and armour timers depending on sec status** --- **This has also been added to the [Eve Forum](URL"

By now, most of you know I'm in Horde. Well, my story starts near the 7rm Beanstar. I was doing simple exploring when I noticed a node in a nearby system didn't have the Horde symbol. I asked how that happened and was introduced to entosis. (the game mechanic used to claim sov) I wanted to try out entosis for myself, so I bought all the gear and set out to get back that single iHub. I had no intention of going further than a few jumps from home, but the game had different plans for my entosis lessons. I started the entosis cycle on the little iHub and went back to the important business of picking my nose while I waited. I wasn't even half way into my first cycle before a boss was demanding I cease the stupidity! I guess there had been some deal reached without my knowledge. (which would be pretty easy to achieve given my status) After being thoroughly hazed, I was told jokingly to go entosis goons instead. The nonchalant sentence stuck with my and I immediately headed towards the Goon home keepstar with the intentions of at least trying to get one. (I eventually got 7 systems, though none were directly goons) The first system I stumbled upon was The Initiative and their systems. I flew towards their first iHub as fast as my little Catalyst would carry me! I had no idea what was going on, but I saw something to attack, so I went at it! I didn't know that once you hit the link, you can't warp or do anything! Into my second cycle I got to meet The Initiative face to face! However, luck was on my side and my second cycle ended right as the first ship landed! I was able to break away from the scrambler and warp off when I was deep into structure damage. The Initiative doesn't like people touching their stuff apparently, because I was chased across the entire region. I blindly took gate after gate trying to get away. I had no idea where I was going, but I was staying barely out of their grasp. Finally, a nice pilot named Rocky IV (great movie, btw) kindly told me to stop touching their stuff, and I agreed. He actually stopped following me after I agreed! I was surprised that he trusted me to leave their space. I held true to my word and continued on towards Goon space with renewed motivation and a thrilling desire to see where entosis would take me next. I ended up in Goon space late at night for me and I learned that sov can only be attacked at certain times. The goons were secure, so I went to sleep with plans to take their stuff in the morning. The next day, I got my first taste of goon vulnerability, and it tasted good! I got into my second or third cycle on a goon hub in 5-CQDA when I got to meet Tentator. He was much quicker than The Initiative and blew my ship away before I could even turn on my MWD. However, he didn't quite catch my pod! I raced away as fast as I could defeated and hide from his guns. On a side note, I had a private conversation with him and he was pretty cool. I told him I was headed to the goon keepstar and he wished me luck. Nice player. I wandered along in a pod contemplating self-destruction so I could get back home fast, but thought it might be fun to actually get to the Goon Keepstar. I was completely lost and ended up wandering into NPC space. I docked up to blow up my pod after grabbing a drink, but quickly realized that NPC stations give away rookie ships! Maybe my journey wasn't over after all...."

I keep hearing about people stealing citadels or finding them unanchored, As far as I know, you don't see the unanchor timer, just the vulnerability timer (which coincides with the unanchor if you've initiated one?) - So do people just check citadels during vulnerability period using the timer displayed to see if it's unanchored? Last question, an unanchored citadel in space, does it show up on the overview like an anchored citadel? Or does it have to be scanned down?"

(Plus an update on Keepstars),84,75v0an,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/75v0an/noob_perspective_my_epic_journey_part_2_plus_an/,2017-10-12 16:40:48,"After my encounter with Tenator, I was stuck in NPC space with a rookie ship and 40m isk to my name. I gathered my resolve, took a deep breath, and started planning a rebuild. The markets showed an entosis link 10 jumps away. It was 25m isk; expensive, but worth it. I set destination and undocked. The route was clear for less than five minutes before I was introduced to ""insta-lock"" mechanics. a Goon named Machete Kiev caught me at a gate and had me dead faster than I've ever seen. It was incredible! Luckily, he didn't quite catch my pod, so I continued on my journey hoping he didn't want to finish the job. Eventually, I made it to the location and bought the entosis link, then started looking to put it on any ship the market had. I got lucky and found a Griffin at a decent price, so I grabbed it and hopped in with a smile on my face and renewed hope for my future. Sadly, that station didn't have fuel for the entosis link so I was forced to make a few more jumps searching for ship modules. My fit was shit, but it was enough to get me going again. Truth is, shopping in Delve is difficult unless you're a Goon. The markets are sparse and the gates are dangerous. I didn't mind though, I took what I could get and set off again. Goons watch their links closely, but their neighbors don't! I found a Russian system with vulnerability timers, so I set to work. I got through the warm up cycle and half a sandwich before anyone bothered to show up. They warped directly to me and I was surprised to see it was a full Battleship! I knew my little ship was going to die, so I decided to lock up the Russian and die with honor. I may be a newbean, but I'm nobody's bitch. I locked it and typed ""GF"" in local and waited to see my frigate explode. I couldn't believe my luck when the battleship turned and warped off quickly! I shrugged my shoulders and let the second entosis cycle start. I sat back and watched in disbelief as the third cycle finished and the node went into reinforced. As the last seconds ticked down, local filled up with Russians and I knew I was the target. I warped off as the first ships landed at my location. I got away with moments to lose, but I knew they would be waiting at the gates. I felt stuck, but I was determined to make it difficult for them. As I warped from planet to planet, I asked my corp for advice and received some valuable lessons. I learned that D-Scan is super helpful and you can set it to 360 degrees. I immediately scanned and saw bubbles and a few combat probes. My corp explained what the enemy was doing and gave suggestions to counter them. As I warped from location to location, a corp member named Zak gave me a few sentences in Russian to post in local. I don't know exactly what the sentences were, but the Russians did not appreciate them at all! Local lit up like a Christmas tree and moments later 10 more members entered system and I D-scanned at least 15 combat probes and almost that many bubbles. I think they were pretty pissed off. I had a Crow land near me at a planet and I was barely able to get away before it could lock me. I started warping to asteroid belts hoping they wouldn't look there. Local continued scrolling so fast that I couldn't keep up, but it's wasn't a problem for me since I can't read Russian anyways. While warping, I noticed that one belt was close to the exit I want to take. As I landed in the belt, I aligned towards the gate and could see the bubbles. Strangely, I didn't see any ships near the gate. I realized I was on the back side instead of the front. I wasn't sure but I thought maybe the bubbles wouldn't catch me too badly. I decided to warp towards the gate and hopefully burn the rest of the way before they could catch me. I held my breath and hit the warp button. To my utter disbelief, I warped right between two bubbles that didn't quite overlap and landed at zero on the gate. I had warped right between the seam of two bubbles and didn't get caught in either. I quickly typed ""it was nice to meet you all!"" in local then jumped into the great unknown. UPDATE: I'll finish that adventure later. I was going to write two posts because this is two separate adventures but some Reddit members said they would prefer I keep the posts to a minimum. I've finished pictures of seven Goon Keepstars. I currently have: 1-SMEB K-6K16 YQX-7U 7G-QIG PS-94K 5BTK-M D-W7F0 I know the location of 1DG1-A, which I'm saving for last. I'd really appreciate the location of a few others if you know them. I also know 7UTB, which is heavily guarded, lol. After that, I'm flying blind. Okay, I'll end this extremely long post now, but first, I really do want to thank all of the players who have given me isk, and messages of encouragement. I feel like I'm part of a huge family in this game, and it has been an amazing experience so far. We may fight and argue, but that's what families do. I'm glad I get to be a part of this. I'll see you out there, and you better watch your backs, I might have my guns to it someday! "
96,vulnerability,Eve,"Citadel Suggestions, though I know it's too late",0,75wpve,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/75wpve/citadel_suggestions_though_i_know_its_too_late/,2017-10-12 23:41:25,"I am in full agreement that some aspects of citadels need to change. A POS could be removed in a couple days or less. Stations could be taken in four days. Citadels should take far less than a week to remove. I think the proposed changes are too reactive and extreme. They essentially render citadels useless to all but larger corps and alliances. Rather than a 24/7 vulnerability window, and still having two timers after, I suggest more moderate changes. I know you get to pick your primetime but it still essentially means you need to be in a large group capable of 24/7 defense in order to prevent the first RF. 1. 24/7 Vulnerability: I disagree strongly that the Citadels and other structures should have full time vulnerability. a POS could be vulnerable all the time because it was capable of fending off random attackers who simply wanted to troll. Citadels don't have this option. I suggest keeping the timers as they are today with a small change, making them dependent on fuel. See below. 2. Fueled services for resists and Invulnerability: I personally think the fuel for resists can be made a bit more radical. The current proposal is to make resists dependent on fuel. I would add the invulnerability window to this requirement. If the intent is to make removal of inactive citadels easier, This would accomplish that intent without leaving smaller corps unable to keep a structure alive. 3. Service fuel: In keeping with the above, I would ask that a new service (structure defence) be added with a fuel requirement of one cube per hour and enough space for 30 days of operation. Alternatively, just make the fuel requirement for cloning one cube per hour. Fuel is expensive and there are citadels I know of that are used in place of small POSes with a hangar or two. These citadels aren't inactive, even though they are not fueled. 4. Highsec: Inactive citadels in HS need to be war decced to be removed. Highsec is filled to the brim with abandoned citadels. My suggestion is to give them a suspect flag after five days of not having the structure defense (or the cloning service) fueled and online. A new profession of highsec space cleaning will be born. It will fuel the demand for citadels as they are popped one after another. 5. Timers: In keeping the vulnerability windows, I suggest a single invulnerability timer be instituted. 48 hours (+/- 4 hours randomized) after a successful reinforcement, the armor AND structure can be shot. When armor is depleted, the structure offlines all services. This should make people who don't want to waste a week killing a single structure happy while still giving the defenders two days to form. I think these changes that balance the desire to clean up citadel clutter while still allowing smaller groups a chance to survive. They also make it much quicker to kill the damned things than present rules. Alternatively, I would propose a S size structure with unbonused service modules using less fuel and a size L (no freighters/jumpfreighters) max docking size. Make them inexpensive enough that they can be used in out of the way places with a cost low enough that losing them doesn't push players from the game. It might be worth making them anchorable only in Lowsec and Null. "

I didn't see it mentioned in the old patch notes. With vulnerability changing to 24h, would their reason(s) still apply? Aren't they trying to break up the market (e.g. not allowing structures in any of the top 5 market hub systems), and why would letting smaller, weaker structures try to run markets be bad for content?"

So here you all go I guess (**note:** *I ran out of characters, so it's missing a lot*): --- **Alpha Clones** So Eve kinda went free to play, with the following conditions: * Limited skills available based on race * The above obviously limits ships and mods - T1 Cruiser Down * Half Training Speed * Cannot be logged on at the same time as another account --- **Citadels** POSes are being phased out and replaced with citadels. They're like stations, with all the same services, but not sov locked. They can be destroyed, but are fairly well armed and have the ""asset safety"" mechanic: * Transfers your stuff to another friendly citadel in system for free * **OR** transfers your stuff to the nearest NPC (maybe low sec?) station by LY (10% fee) * *Exception:* Everything drops like a loot piata in wormholes *Mechanics:* * You pick the vulnerability times, so you force the enemy to attack at specific times * 3 Reinforce Stages (Shield, Armor, Hull) * 1 Week to kill in K-Space, 3 dats in J-Space * DPS cap means you *have* to be on field for at least 30mins each timer * To pause it from exiting vulnerability, you have to deal 10% of the DPS cap * They have stupidly powerful void (neuting) bombs - so everyone uses passive hell tank armor fleets (armor machs, abaddons and phoons are very popular because of this) * Otherwise they behave like a fueled station, with market, ship fitting, insurance, clone bay, etc. They have a ""tether"" in a wide range of the structure which prevents things interacting with the ship, but locking or agressing breaks tethering. There are three sizes: * Medium - Astrahus (Subcaps and Industry Capitals Only) * Large - Fortizar (Caps as well) * X-Large - Keepstar (Supers can dock) * *Any ship size can tether and be invulnerable* They're gradually rolling out specialised ones - first were the general purpose combat ones, then the industry ones, now the moon mining and reprocessing ones. There's been whispers about stargates and arrays to get information about space you live in (ie. people moving around), but those have been whispered about for years, so don't hold your breath. *There's insane citadel proliferation at the moment because to dock, tether and use fittings or hangar storage requires no fuel - lots of chokepoints have been opened up as a result, and it's impossible to die while moving a super unless you are actually retarded). They're also a pain in the ass to dislodge due to the 1.5hrs on grid to kill, in 3 different ops a week apart. Get used to seeing shit tonnes of them around, they're part of eve's environment now.* First Keepstar to die was Project Mayhem's as it was onlining, first online one to die was Co2's. First to online was HK's in their wormhole. They have at least one more in their home hole, and god knows how many others. --- **Sov Changes** Only relevant if you live in Null Sec. Instead of the old ""bash the structure then put your own down"" style, you now use a module to capture points like a game of CTF. These modules called ""Entosis"" consume a small amount of stront, and prevent you warping off and limit your speed (trolling Entosis Ceptors were a fairly big problem at the start). * There's half a dozen or so points at any one time, and they constantly respawn (slightly regenerating in the defense's favour) * Only one ship can entosis a node at the same time, unless you kill or jam it so it loses lock * One side ""completes"" the transfer when they capture enough nodes over the opponent * It's meant to encourage small gang warfare, in reality you usually end up with hell tanked ships with cynos on the capture points (""nodes"") and everyone else on a bridge titan. * Griffins are a pain in the ass, and large inty fleets are common defense fleets against entosis ships * Because you can anchor citadels without owning the system's station or sov, they're often used as forward staging bases for sov attacks --- **Cap Changes** This was a total rework of all capital mechanics. *Mechanics:* * Triage got split out to a new ship class, that only reps things called ""FAXes"" * No other capital ship can rep things anymore (so spider tanking is dead) * Carriers got a UI overhaul so instead of drone boats they behave more like aircraft carriers with squadrons you can manually control and activateable modules / guns * Dread's are the same price as carriers now * Slight increase to capital range (this happened a little later) *Modules:* * Capital neuts exist. Shield supers are now redundant in large super brawls because of them * Capital cap boosters exist along with matching charges, almost everyone uses them * Capital props exist - the MWD sucks so much cap it isn't funny, so everyone uses ABs * Plates/extenders exist (at a cost of a basic hp nerf) so you end up with a net loss in EHP and Resists * A new module which acts as a capital only damage control was introduced and gives invulnerability for 22s, but burns out after one use (used on dread bombs and suicide triage) ""Hull Energizer"" * Dreads got anti-subcap guns and T2 guns, they're pretty baller * Lots of new fighters, including eWar, Long Range Bombers (compared to the existing short range), anti-fighter fighters as well as T2 varients * Carriers have a hyper-sensor booster highslot called the ""NSA"" (I'm not joking) * New AoE Titan DDs - it's like Pipe Bombing 2.0 and it's hilarious (also legit for ratting) * Just about every capital module has T1, Meta and T2 variants *Meta:* * Thannies and Nids are the two better carriers now * Revs and Nags are the two better dreads now (scorch OP) * Shield supers are shit for fleets, it's essentially armor only because capital neuts exist * Conversely, shield supers are fantastic for small gang and ganking * Dread bombs are stupidly strong thanks to the invulnerability module and cheaper price --- **Miscellaneous** * T3Ds nerfed (esp. Svipul) * T3C rebalance * Faction Capitals/Supers exist (still being phased in, we currently have Serpentis and Blood Raider, with Guristas coming soon and Angel designs shown). All use the basic models but reskinned, though the Angel concept art shows unique models and they're gorgeous (e.g. [Titan](URL * A shit tonne of things I don't remember * *Lots* of Tiercide - I couldn't even begin to list them all, but the changes were good * Various nerfs and buffs * New type of Web called a ""Grappler"" - Battleship and Up only, falls of with range like a turret, stupidly effective in the closer ranges - [comparison graph](URL * More Overview tabs * Ship icons are now unique to each class - [the original version](URL was trash because when scaled down they all looked the same. CCP listened to the player feedback and [produced these](URL which imho is the single best change that's happened in Eve since I started playing. --- **Mechanic Meta** * Drone meta is pretty much gone in fleets, Ishtars were nerfed a lot (I've genuinely lost count), Gilas were a little bit and carriers no longer use drones (drones were nerfed overall too, as well as DDAs). Rattlesnakes aren't bad and used in low sec, but very rare in null. * The carrier changes allowed for some funky shit around alphaing things because carriers could a) instalock and b) alpha the fuck out of subs * Supers are similar, and some people have made a habit of [alphaing Jump Freighters as they align to a high sec gate](URL * Machariels are the premier doctrine, almost everyone uses them as their top subcap doctrine (even some newbro groups). They had their drop rate and build cost nerfed, but it's still the premier subcap doctrine * Alpha meta is very popular, with arty hurricanes seeing use from a number of different alliances * Logi is swinging much harder towards cap chaining, mainly because of citadel void bombs * T3Cs have always been extremely popular - slightly less so atm as alliances start to figure out how they work post-patch * Rorquals are stupidly good. They've been nerfed twice and they're still insanely good sources of income, and Delve (where Goons live now) [consistently have obscenely high mining numbers in the economic reports](URL * They also had an invulnerability module that got nerfed. [Doomchinchilla has a meme floating around him to do with this](URL when this change was implemented, please don't repeat or ask about it because it's been flogged to death. **Politics Meta**: * Goons got kicked out of the North in World War Bee by essentially the rest of the game combined (they tried to invade Low Sec, seriously pissed off the locals, and got counterattacked when everyone else realised LS by themselves managed to hold their own and started smelling blood in the water). [Shameless self-promotion, I wrote a big FAQ post about that war too if you weren't around for it].(URL * Test/Co2 had a big-but-smaller war after this for control of the north, with PL bashing Co2's keepstar to finish it off (first online keepstar to fall) * Goons, with the help of Test, recently tried to reinvade against a North now held by PL/NC and GOTG (Darkness + Friends). It didn't work, but they took some r64s in Syndicate, lost a couple fortizar citadels, lost their dread bomb trying to kill a faction titan, and are now going home - was a lot of good fun though outside of LS TiDi. * The West was a 'frenemy' fight club with NAP for their structures for a while, was pretty cool and let some newbro alliances get to their feet * The South was a big fractured mess, then recently became a ""Legacy Coalition"" (because it was a bunch of old friends who used to live there, Brave, Test, etc. who moved in). Co2 are there too after they split with Goons, along with FCON. There's a big war brewing down there with Tri coming into the mix too. * TRI poached the best propaganda artist ever from Test. *This is possibly the worst thing to happen because we no longer get cute Dino art (look up /u/Cymek - his work is amazing).* * Goons have been bleeding supers and rorquals constantly the past few months, mainly to PL, as well as WH groups and a few others.

101,vulnerability,Eve,Let's talk about something that's not Judgement Day. Faction Warfare?,11,702e0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/702e0d/lets_talk_about_something_thats_not_judgement_day/,2017-09-14 23:59:59,"Anyone feel like having a chat about FW? How about some thoughts? The CSM minutes got me to thinking, what kind of solutions *would* help to promote FW as a PVP zone? I'm starting from a standpoint of FW having three primary problems that could be addressed to help the health of the system as a whole. * Current mechanics encourage pilots to swap sides to stay on the winning side, which tends to make FW space very static and difficult to budge without significant sways in pilot activity. The gutted rewards for Tier 1 factions helps contribute even more to this effect. * Current mechanics are fairly uninteractive; defensive plexing is nearly risk-free and offensive plexing not especially difficult at all, encouraging deplex farming by people with no intention of actually engaging in fights (warpstabbed farmers, bots). This is a contributing factor to warzone stagnation, as well. * Citadels provide safe docking and repair points and effectively neutralize warzone control as a supply line issue, not to mention pushing plexing of both types to still less risk thanks to an abundance of safe bug-out docking locations regardless of system ownership. So, anyone have any ideas what fixes could help address these problems? My thoughts today: First, making the factions themselves a bit less helpless. Assign systems relatively close to faction-owned highsec space an ""original owner"" faction, and cause contestedness ratings in those systems to naturally rise accordingly. This shouldn't be enough to automatically flip those systems, but say if systems in FW warzones within a jump or two (or three) of gates to highsec were to naturally trend toward some nonzero contestedness rating if below it. The goal here is to make it significantly harder to push a faction below Tier 2 without completely holding the hands of the losing faction. Second. Navy/Fleet Issue ships are great. The Comet, the Firetail. Why are faction plex defenders so wussy? Address people plexing in non-PVP fits by beefing up the plex defenders; they shouldn't be so tough that a PVP-fit ship of the appropriate T1 hull class can't beat them, but they shouldn't be so trivial that I can stop my Tristan and AFK in an offensive novice with my drones out, and expect to clear the site as long as nobody comes in to bother me. Defensive plexing is another issue entirely, but one that I would hope would be at least partially addressed by my third point. Citadels. Not going to dredge up questions of timers, vulnerability, or ease of citadel spam. No, I had a thought for a citadel system change that might actually directly address FW concerns in the short term, *without* waiting for CCP to decide how to address the larger concerns with the Upwell structure system. Add a mandatory clause to the access listings of *all* Upwell structures docked in Faction Warfare space blocking docking and tethering access to *all* pilots aligned with a militia opposed to the one owning the system in which the structure is anchored. Or, in short, Citadels/Refineries/ECs in FW space automatically bar docking access to enemies of the system owner, whether the owning corporation is aligned with FW or not. This would include pilots of the owning corporation. As a form of recompense, perhaps give a discount on fuel costs for structures owned by FW-aligned corps and anchored in FW space, and/or apply a fuel cost penalty or a tax on structures anchored in FW space and owned by unaligned corps. Have at it, folks. How much of an idiot am I?"
102,vulnerability,Eve,Dear CCP - My personal wishlist for EVE.,19,6o94b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6o94b9/dear_ccp_my_personal_wishlist_for_eve/,2017-07-20 01:16:10,"While I like EVE as a game, there are some things in it i don't like or think could be improved. Every EVE-player probably has their own list of things they'd like changed, removed or added, but this one is mine. Citadels/New structures: * currently, there is no limit to how many of them you can anchor in a system. This is in contrast to the limits of one POS per moon and one station per system. To add a value to variouis systems all over new eden, a limit to the amount of structures in the system should be added. this limit could be based on the amount of planets and moons in the system (for example: each moon adds one ""point"" to the system, each planet adds five. a whole system with a dozen planets that have a couple of moons each could be worth 100 points for example. now each of the new structures gets a point value. one point per refinery, five for an astrahus, fifteen for a fort, 40 for a sotiyo (sp?), 50 for a keepstar, 100 for a palatine keepstar.) * currently citadels are vulnerable for a limited amount of time and take a long time to kill and (outside of WH space) there is little risk associated with losing one, due to asset safets. all of that makes attacking and defending them a tedious process with a risk of burning out players. To combat that, while still keeping a balance between attacking and defending them, make them vulnerable 24/7, but once reinforced, give the defenders a 24h window to decide, when within the next 7 days the two next vulnerability windows will be. the windows have a combined minimum time and a minimum time for each (so the first could be 15min, the minimum possible, the second would then have to be 3h45min, for a total of 4h. both windows would be in the prime time of the defending alliance. for example). on top of that, change asset safety so it doesn't cost isk to get access to your stuff, but rather there is a % of loot dropped and a %of loot lost, depending on the sec of the system (this could scale from 5% dropped and 5% lost in 1.0 down to 15% dropped and 15% lost in -1.0). space with better payouts would then carry a higher risk with it, the defenders won't have to pay isk to get their stuff back, while the attackers (if they hold the grid) can go home with some loot. * also, while there is the matter of damage cap. this is a mechanic to make it so larger groups can't just drop the living shit out of a smaller one and nuke their citadels in a few seconds. however, there is a point to be made that a larger/more powerful group should have some sort of advantage over a weaker/smaller one. to represent that in the game, a ""breaking point"" could be introduced. if the incoming damage in a tick is for example &gt;10 times the damage cap, it ignores the damage cap. once it drops below that value, the damage cap applies. that means the attacker can decide to drop a significant amount of assets and kill the citadel in a shorter time. A benefit of this is that it would allow to speed up cleanup after a group is dead or has left an area, but has left behind a bunch of citadels. Sov: * Entosis and the associated gameplay can be annoying for both attackers and defenders and can take an unreasonable amount of time compared to the effort an attacker or defender invests in it. To change that, make nodes for a system only spawn in that system, but make it easier to attack, the more systems in a constellation are currently being attacked/the more you already own (at the same time, if the defenders own the whole constellation, it would be harder for the attackers to entosis the first system(s). this, combined with the max limit for structures per system would give the defenders a clear initial advantage, while the attacker has to gain a beachead, but once the beachhead is there and the attacker is making gains, it would gradually become easier to kick out the defenders.) Assault frigs &amp; Interceptors: it is a common complaint that assault frigs are in a very bad spot in the game atm and it also is a (slightly less common) complaint that interceptors are a bit OP in some situations (taxi fits, inty fleets...). while the issues seem unrelated, if roles were shifted and shuffled between the two, both groups could become more balanced. * Interceptors: split them into a scout interceptor, with nullification and a fitting bonus towards cynos, cloaks and probe launchers, but low overall fitting room and slow(ish) align and a fast aligning, fast tackle ceptor without nullification but a small bonus towards tackle range and role bonus for smaller sig bloom from mwds as well as a small buffer/active tank bonus. both types would favor short range weapons with great application, but (next to) no damage bonuses, so they can work against other frigs. * Assault frigs: split them into an offensife and a defensive one per faction. the offensive one would go for speed, damage, agility and short to mid ranges, while the defensive ones go for tank, range and application at mid to long ranges (for frigs). allow both to fit one command burst with a -99.9% range modifier (so it only applies to the ship itself). this gives some flexibility for solo/small gangs, while giving fleets the option to focus on something (like range OR tackle OR tank OR speed, or to give some ships in the fleet special roles) Dailies (""The Agnency""): * switch them to once between down times. * split rewards in two categories: a fixed reward per daily (like 500SP for killing 25 NPCs, some extra loot for completing 5 data/relic sites, 10 plex for destroying 500m ISK worth of player ships, etc.) and a random reward for gathering X amount of agency points (for example a random event skin (cold iron, purity of the throne,...) for 50 points, a random skin (any skin) for 100 points, a random 1 run navy/pirate faction frig bpc for 200 points, etc. Carriers: currently it is a bit too easy to defang carriers by either killing their fithers or jamming the fighters. to fix that, the following changes would make it harder to defang the carrier (while making it slightly easier to kill individual fighters, if you have the right damage type) and force more of a choice between cheap, easy to kill T1 fighters and slightly harder to kill and expensive T2 fighters. All changes apply to all types of fighters * increase fighter bay volume by 100% for all carriers and supers * increase sensor strength by 100% for all fighters * decrease fighter scan res by 50% * decrease T1 fighter HP by 20% * give all fighters a resist profile according to their faction. ehp gain through increased resists makes up for half of the HP decrease (buff by 10% for T2 fighters) * increase fighter sig by 10% * decrease T1 fighter cost through required materials by 10% * increase T2 fighter cost through required materials by 10% Hangars: Introduce hangars you can give specific players, corporations or alliances access to. costs 5m ISK to set up in any structure you can dock in, 1m ISK per char added to ACL, corp/alliance cost scales with size. upkeep: 100k ISK/month per char. This allows for an alliance hangar, or your personal hangar each of your toons can access. Bookmarks: introduce subscriptions for bookmark lists. similar to mailing lists, one person or a group of persons manages the bookmarks in the list, all members get the bookmarks. the owner(s) can set a per month subscription fee per character, corp or alliance. Ship models: * please finish building my Aeon (or better yet: make the Amarr redo the whole design process so it doesn't look like a huge bestower when it's done. all the other supers look really good, only the faction with the pretty ships got an ugly one). * please properly redo the celestis (so it's no longer causing eye-cancer to its pilots) * make it so the atron model doesn't look like halves from two different ships were glued together in a hurry. * fix capital ship sizes: subcaps&lt;caps&lt;supers&lt;titans I probably forgot a ton of stuff, but w/e."
103,vulnerability,Eve,Suggested Changes to Structure Vulnerability/Reinforcement Mechanics,8,6ka078,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6ka078/suggested_changes_to_structure/,2017-06-30 03:46:26,"With the implementation of new structures came a very different way of dealing with timers. Most notably, the extension of the time it takes to kill one vs what has been used for a POS or POCO. It more closely represents that of sov RF mechanics in terms of vulnerability and exit timers. On the one hand, this has made life much easier for a Structure owner to manage and ends the need to use stront or get to a tower quick enough to set the stront right. It also gives a much larger window in which the defender has time to organize and prepare for a final defense. On the other hand, it has made the life of potential hostiles very frustrating and time-consuming. It can be made to specifically exclude certain TZs from ever participating in the process, with possible exclusion of weekends. If we include some oddities and unclear mechanics, it further makes the life of an attacker much more difficult. All things considered, the change has drastically moved to favor the defender. So I propose an adjusted system that more closely leans toward old POS RF mechanics, while maintaining a progressive benefit for the defender as the situation worsens. The goal will be to allow specific advantages to either the defender or the attacker, depending on the situation. The goal also includes making sure that not all of the maximum benefits for one side or the other are in play during the majority of the process. Behind the shoots and fights themselves, there will be a little tug of war for different aspects of process. Now for the details: (for this example we will use citadels Astrahus, Fortizar, and Keepstar. Values may be different for other structures) **Removal/Repurpose of Vulnerability Timers** * Remove vulnerability timers * Introduce exit windows This is similar to how POCOs work. The owner sets times that they choose as for when the structure wil exit on any given day. Each structure will have a certain amount of hours per week/day which it may exit. For starter numbers, I suggest 21/28/36 for M/L/XL respectively (specifics debatable). On top of that, all structures must have a minimum of 1 hour each day of the week. Using my suggested numbers, this means the exit timer could range from a balanced 3 hours for 7 days, or a more conservative approach; 1 hour for 6 days and 15 hours for one day. This allows the owner to be flexible about which days they believe they are likely to have more coverage throughout the day. Maybe longer times on weekends or maybe Wednesday is a good day, so you throw some extra hours then. Regardless, this puts the choice of response in favor of the defender. **Structures Are Always Vulnerable** * There is no defender choice on occurrence of initial attack This allows groups with multiple TZs to cooperate, without entirely deciding the result. It also returns the advantage of initiative back in favor of the attacker. All other things equal, a true surprise attack should be the advantage of the attacker. It also allows them to use a little Intel/spy work to possibly time the process when it suits them or is perceived as unfavorable to the enemy. **Reinforcement Durations and Occurances** * Varied number of timers based on structure size * 1 - 2 day timers on all structures * Services no longer affected by RF * Retain 15 minute repair window To give a clear and significant benefit to choosing a larger structure, the number of possible timers will be based on size: Medium = 1 timer, Large = 2 timers, and Extra-Large = 3 timers. With increasingly valuable assets comes more chances to protect them. Or at a minimum, more time to recover assets. Varying timer counts somewhat reflects the amount of effort needed to destroy certain sized structures, which can be especially painful if there are no defenders present. This also more closely reflects Medium structures to their POS counterparts As for time between exits, it would be a simple method: the structure will be vulnerable again on the next timer after 24 hours. This allows the defender a minimum of 24 hours to be notified and prepare. In conjunction with the 1 hour minimum per day, this also ensures that hours can't be stacked in a method requiring the whole week to complete. To clarify, this means that if the end of that 24 hour period lands on an exit window, the next (the following day) open timer is chosen. Since Medium structures (the most common) won't have multiple timers, it would be very unfair to consistently have services shut off because the attacker is simply playing TZ games. Also returns a bit of home-field advantage back to the defender. Structures will still retain the 15-minute repair window. This mechanic is very favorable compared to old POS/POCO repair mechanics. And that pretty much sums up the process. TL;DR: * more opportunities for attack * less frustration for attack * time investment for attack more granularp"

(Disclaimer: I have never been a pirate myself. My PvP happens in w-space.) **1  The Goal** *I had been tracking GankerBoi666 for two days now. After his most recent crime spree in Uedama, he and his little band of thugs ran off into low-sec, presumably to unload their loot in some skeevy black market station and replace the Catalysts that CONCORD blew up. I lost them three jumps in, and barely escaped the gate camp his friends had set up. No justice for the victims that day, and no money for me.* *I had returned to my home station, and asked a couple of locator agents to put out some feelers. It took a while for them to return a hit. Since the residents of Uedama were on alert, GankerBoi666 circled around highsec to find his next target. Yesterday, he finally stopped moving long enough for the agents to get a system. As soon as they gave me the location, I altered course and pushed the engines on my Hecate as hard as I could.* *I arrived in Niarja and checked the local traffic nets. GankerBoi666 and his crew were already there! I didnt know whether they knew they were being followed, so I quickly turned my ship into deep interplanetary space. If GankerBoi666 was in the system, it wouldnt be long before he made his move. If I didnt act fast, hed start shooting the local freighter traffic. I didnt really care about the freighters, but if I didnt get to him before CONCORD was called in, thered be no bounty for me. That was just unacceptable.* *I dropped some scanner probes in the system and started sifting through the hundreds of signatures they returned, looking for anything Catalyst-shaped. One by one, I filtered out the mining barges and the freighters, the battleships and the cruisers. I found a cluster of faint signatures hanging in deep-space, just like me. That had to be them. One last scan cycle from the probes gave me a lock on their position, and I hit the warp drive.* *Time to get paid.* --- Please forgive my shitty prose above. The point wasnt to write the next best-selling thriller, or an accurate depiction of gameplay (One Hecate against a squad of suicide Catalysts? Very ISK-negative for the hunter.) Poor writing aside, though, thats the kind of story you would expect from EVE if you didnt know anything about the actual game mechanics. You just hear about low-sec space, pirates, bounties, and you can just see that scenario playing out in your head. Sounds awesome, right? Even if it werent great ISK/hour, its the kind of content, player-created on both sides, that should define EVE. So why doesnt it happen? **2  Obstacles** There several factors  some of them player behaviors, some of them game mechanics  which all conspire to make bounty hunting not-a-thing, but they can all be distilled to a single major obstacle: **Finding worthwhile targets.** Ill admit that, even knowing Id be disappointed, Ive taken my Hecate out and roamed highsec looking for suspect flags or cheap kill rights. They dont exist, at least not enough to make it worth the effort. (Note that Im not proposing that all of these obstacles should or can be changed.) Kill rights are a joke. Today, theyre used only for selling your own kill mails. Im sure youve seen the battleships floating on highsec gates with kill rights available for 200 million ISK. The part where kill rights are made available to the public, and the pirate finds himself looking over his shoulder as he goes about his day? Yeah, it doesnt happen at all. Kill rights are useless for their purpose. If theyre too cheap, the pirate claims them himself. If theyre too expensive, theyll never get activated. And to top it all off, the kill rights dont matter if theres no bounty placed by a player to go with it. Outside of kill rights, there are no real long-term consequences for piracy. Theres no commitment. A drop in security status that can be reversed with tags, and a 15 minute timer dont qualify, especially with alts. The players who engage in piracy typically have alts dedicated to the task. When they arent actively pirating, theyre off on their incursion alt or their nullsec ratter. Even if theyre logged into their pirate pilot, theyd be stupid to sit undocked. The fact is, for all intents and purposes, the pirates dont exist except for the 30 seconds theyre on-grid shooting someone. Theres nobody to hunt. **3  Incentives** There needs to be a reasonable promise of reward (if successful) in order to make bounty hunting a thing in EVE. ISK is an obvious first candidate, but theres currently no guarantee that a pirate will actually have a bounty on them. There also needs to be incentives for the pirate side of the equation, too. Piracy should absolutely be a rewarding career path in EVE. Since piracy actually occurs, though, I think thats covered  or at least in less dire need of tweaking. Prestige and bragging rights are absolutely something EVE players pursue. Just look at how seriously we take our kill boards. **4  A Step Forward** I think theres a relatively simple way to improve the criminal justice system in New Eden. Its far from complete, but its a start: Pend Insurance will no longer pay out basic insurance rates to capsuleer victims in Empire space. Instead, those funds will be placed as a bounty on the party or parties responsible for the destruction of the ship. Pend Insurance bounties pay out before bounties placed by players. While a pilot has a Pend bounty on them, they are flagged as a suspect. This would have several advantages (I think) over the current system: * Transferring the insurance payout to a bounty prevents the introduction of a new ISK faucet, and even keeps that ISK out of circulation until it gets claimed. * While pirates can still get rid of their own Pend bounties by blowing up their own ships, the 20% rule keeps it from being an economical option. * Pirates that can avoid losing ships will accrue larger bounties, earning them prestige on the Bounty Office leader boards in addition to their ill-gotten loots. * Anyone who is recognized as a pirate under this system (by having a Pend bounty on them) is guaranteed to be worth at least some ISK to a hunter. Those advantages dont cover all of the obstacles to having a decent cops-and-robbers game in EVE. Pirates can still dock up, switch to alts, etc. I had even more drastic proposals in mind, like being unable to dock in highsec while you have a Pend bounty. If pirates had to go to lowsec to reship (Orca and Bowhead notwithstanding), then law-abiding citizens of New Eden could have gate camps of their own at the borders to highsec. Itd mean criminals would have at least some small window of vulnerability when hunters could make an attempt. But Im sure you clever folks could come up with alternatives. Rather than restricting highsec stations, it might be possible to introduce some incentive for pirates to continue playing on their pirate character. **TL;DR - Pend Insurance places bounties instead of basic insurance payouts. Pend bounties make you suspect.** Let the flaming and/or discussion begin! (Edit for formatting)"
106,vulnerability,Eve,Probably another bad idea (update); take dem citadels.,16,6m6qgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6m6qgw/probably_another_bad_idea_update_take_dem_citadels/,2017-07-09 20:11:17,"After feedback i reworked what i had to better suit what people were saying. So i see a lot of complaints about the current citadel mechanics, how they are destroying content in null etc etc Chiefly how it is a massive pain to have to form for three timers which may or may not be defended and are often tz tanked, often leading to member burnout. This combined with the notion that any large alliance will simply spam the hell out of them to make life hell for any attacker force. So why not copy real military tactics; take and occupy. How it works; You attack and take sov in the usual fashion, TCU/Ihub. And plant your own flag, once sovereignty has been secured, a new UI window is made available to directors? Perhaps a new role? Which is available only while in the system in question. All citadels owned by the defender corporation are now shown in this window for that system, week by week you an chose to do one if the following for all (indiviually) enemy citadels in system; Remove one timer; shield then armour finally at week three permanent vulnerability in hull. Take control; week by week you weaken the citadels internal defenders, using marines and scientists as an additional ISK sink with the goal of eventually securing the citadel for your own corporation. This means you can keep your members fresh by only having to form for one timer if you are willing to wait while you have sov, although this means that the defender corporation has up to three weeks to retake sov and reset your progress (if any). Any defending citadel in a system that has had sov seized by the attackers cannot be taken down by the defending corporation. In addition to this if a citadel is destroyed while in permanent hull from the removal of timers 15% of assets from all sources, are straight up dropped, the rest are put into asset safety as per the current mechanics. If a citadel is taken by securing the citadel using marines and scientists, it is left vulnerable in hull while you have to repair both the armour and shields at a reduced rate before the new owner can interact with it, this means the defender corporation can move in and snipe the citadel if they chose while the citadels defences are offline. In addition if the citadel is taken in this fashion 20% of all assets are made available in a new inventory tab available to those with the correct role to be distributed / sold. All other assets enter asset safety as per usual mechanics. If the citadel is destroyed/sniped by the defending corporation before the shields and armour are fully restored all assets enter asset safety as they would under current mechanics. Hopefully this will induce a more secure and control the system, while preventing citadel spam and giving attackers an incentive to move into a system and secure it. And give defenders multiple options to re-secure or deny assets in the system. This applies only to null, LowSec and high sec citadels would need another workaround for this system, perhaps a new structure? If at all. Tldr; lose sovereignty, your citadels are now more vulnerable, and have a chance to lose some of YOUR stuff. "
107,vulnerability,Eve,Suggestions,0,6ma7bo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6ma7bo/suggestions/,2017-07-10 07:47:10,"So I've been looking at a lot of things in Eve and what would make things better/worse. This is my first post like this. These are just ideas. Suggestions to make them better are welcome. They'd fix a lot and create content. So here's some ideas. They're moderate changes. Nothing too big. Been playing since 05. Seen a lot of changes. Some good and some bad. Just wanted to throw these out there. Sov: -Sov needs more value. Or a reason to hold it. -When Sov changes hands citadels owned by anyone other than the Sov holder will go fully vulnerable within 1 hour of Sov changing hands (no timer structure bashing). If they survive the vulnerability timer they stay with normal timers. Citadels: -All citadel inventories in NS, LS, and HS have a 10% chance to drop loot per item. As in every piece of inventory in player hangers, Corp hangers, etc has a 10% chance to drop as loot and 10% chance to be destroyed. The rest goes to safe. Risk vs Gain. Maybe 20%. But 10% is still effective. Ships in hangers have a 10% chance to be destroyed as well. Maybe make it higher for LS and NS. -Allow for entosis to remove 1 timer from citadels if they can do a full cycle. For example a citadel would spawn 6 command nodes in system over time around the citadel. If you successfully entosis it you remove 1 timer. Cannot be used with the Sov change listed above. NPC Ratting: -Bounties in NS require a citadel type sov structure. This structure reports to concord. If fully fueled (yes it'll need fuel) and upgraded it gives 100% of bounty. If not fueled it only gives 50% with full upgrades. The structure has 5 slots for upgrades. Each gives 10% of bounty value. The fuel adds another 50%. (Isk sink galore between fuel and modules). This structure has 3 timers. During the 2nd one the modules spawn as nodes to entosis or destroy. If you destroy them it knocks them out. If you entosis them you knock out the 3rd timer allowing it to be killed right then. It has no defenses and can't be anchored within 1 AU of any structures. Not deployable in WH space. -Lower spawn rates of NPC rat sites in Null. Meaning you need more territory to actually make Isk with larger alliances. As there won't be enough to go around. Random things: -More Guristra stuff. Ships, skins, etc. Please."
108,vulnerability,Eve,Capacitor warfare - current state and change suggestion,8,6mnrz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6mnrz1/capacitor_warfare_current_state_and_change/,2017-07-12 03:32:32,"## TL;DR Capacitor warfare dominates entire EVE meta; it's not considered broken because everyone uses it, but it breaks many parts of meta. Doubling base numbers on all active modules that affect capacitor by flat number (neuts, nos, cap transfers, cap boosters, void bombs etc.) while scaling their strength with capacitor percentage of target should put it more in-line with other kinds of ewar while making meta more flexible. ## Current state of capacitor warfare in EVE metagame Energy neutralization, remote capacitor transmitters, cap boosters and - to lesser extent - nosferatu are currently omnipresent, from solo pvp (using utility hislots), to small gang, to WH brawling, to citadel sieges. To not search too far, Bhaalgorns, capchain logi, neut Legions and Armageddons are staple of most heavy Wormhole doctrines; [Bhaalgorn dominates AT meta](URL for years now; [shield supercapitals](URL are considered inferior to armor just due to lack of passive omniresist shield module and their vulnerability to have tank fully neuted; Machariels dominated nullsec structure bash meta because they're invulnerable to citadel Guided Void Bombs. Even for hunting, solo or small gang setups, Stratios is one of the most popular ganker/hunter ships due to its drone damage and enough hislots to fit 3-4 neuts; similar situation for Sin as most popular/versatile black ops battleship; larger solo/microgang roaming ships using neuts to deal with tacklers; utility slots almost always being filled with neuts while sometimes using nosferatu etc. Currently energy neutralization is the only kind of ewar that is able to affect (depending on ship targeted): * Resistances (more potent against shield-tanked ships). * Local tank (more potent against armor-tanked ships, shield can work around by using Ancillary Shield Booster). * Speed (propulsion modules use capacitor). * Mobility (MJD requires capacitor, jump drive requires ship to be at over 70% cap). * Damage (energy and hybrid weapons require capacitor to work, same goes for smartbombs). * Electronic warfare (all ewar modules require capacitor to work). Capacitor warfare also scales multiplicatively with numbers - especially when considering how it affects tank, speed or mobility. In most cases, to make killing a ship faster, it's enough to put all neuts on your target and it should shut down most its active defensive modules quickly. This is as effective against frigates/cruisers as against supercapitals - as long as you don't run fully passive setup, you're vulnerable to being capped out and subsequently killed with ease (usually). ### How current state of cap warfare affects meta First of all, it forces basically all brawling/close range doctrines to be capless-guns armor-based with passive resists (or active resists augmented with cap booster), due to shield vulnerability to being neuted dry when primaried. Setups like HAML Legion, AC armor Machariel, HAML/HML Damnation etc. are very common and borderline dominant in W-space, despite having higher mass than shield counterparts (due to plates adding mass) and therefore being - in theory - less optimal choice for heavier setups. Second, it shifts shield/armor imbalance of supercapitals even more towards armor (despite existance of Slave implants) - making it possible to shut down 40-70% EHP of target supercap with just few capital neuts and few properly staggered heavy neuts. Sheer amount of drained capacitor with how capacitor recharge equations works at very low capacitor levels means shield supers are easily killed without FAXes being present on grid in mere seconds after they start being shot. Third, it is one of the main reasons of Machariels online a lot of people complained about - Machariels being ships bonused for capless guns (projectiles), with great ability to armor tank and enough lowslots to make them viable with fully passive armor setup, while also keeping decent speed and agility despite being dual-plated. Ships that were invulnerable to void bombs (both regular and guided) and - by own bonuses and attributes - solved most heavy armor doctrine problems (very low mobility, long rep cycle from logistics). Fourth, it forces most solo/small gang fits to either be capbooster-based, ancillary shield booster-based or similar, because for most active tanked cap regen fits it's enough to get under some neut pressure (single Arbitrator or Vexor will usually be enough, not to mention ships like Bhaalgorn or Armageddon) to be almost completely shut down. In most cases it works similar to ECM in regard of being defenseless, except you still can have targets locked and it also shuts down your tank. ## Add capacitor level scaling Simple (in terms of both understanding and - I hope - development part) solution to most capacitor warfare problem would be adding scaling based on effect target capacitor percentage. For all current neutralization/injection effect, just double current value, assume it's base number and add to it scaling based on current capacitor level. Example: **Heavy Energy Neutralizer II** currently drains 600GJ of capacitor per cycle. Change it to 1200GJ per cycle multiplied by targets current capacitor percentage. So, make it burn 1200GJ from target with full capacitor, 600GJ from target at 50% capacitor, 300GJ from target at 25% capacitor and 1GJ from target at below 0.1% capacitor (drained out). With that change it's much easier to break cap stability or hit large capacitor pool of most ships (including getting target capital below jump cap), while making it much harder to drain target completely and shut down all their active modules. Capacitor warfare therefore remains strong at hitting cap-heavy usages (say, logistics, oversized propmode ships), while not making it ultimate solution for shutting down any target. ### Modules affected * Energy neutralizers - capacitor drain scales with target capacitor percentage. * Energy nosferatu - capacitor drain scales with target capacitor percentage, capacitor gain (when applicable, using current rules) scales with users capacitor percentage from **base value** (so draining larger ship being low on cap doesn't affect your cap gain). * Capacitor transmitter - capacitor gain gets reverse scaling (100% effect at 0% capacitor, 0% effect at full capacitor) with targets capacitor percentage. * Capacitor boosters - capacitor gain gets reverse scaling, like with capacitor transmitter. * Void Bomb, Focused Void Bomb and Guided Void Bomb - scales with target capacitor percentage for each target hit separately. * Energy Neutralization Burst Projector - scales with target capacitor percentage for each target hit separately. * AoE Doomsday capacitor drain effect on activation - scales with target capacitor percentage for each target hit separately. All modules above get their base capacitor drain/gain values doubled from current state. ### How it would affect current meta First of all, it would invalidate passive preference just due to capacitor warfare, making active modules strong and preffered choice in low cap usage setups - things like AC Sleipnirs, AC shield Machariels, HAML Cerberus, other brawling doctrines with good gapclosing parameters being viable option against both brawling and long-range setups. It would also shift target of capacitor warfare (now not being default choice for brawling setups) towards cap-heavy ships in target doctrine like logistics, boosters, support ships etc.; therefore making it complementary to damps, tracking/missile disruptors and so on. Second, it would make active cap setups (ships using cap booster as integral part of their kit) harder to fly optimally, but potentially a bit stronger, making it more viable to have more smaller cap boosters or using smaller charges to get more cap at lower capacitor percentage. Proper timing of cap booster just after active module (prop, rep) would give more raw benefit than just running it whenever if you're below certain level of cap. Third, it's shift from stagger neut preference to neutralization nuke preference - having single larger neut being stronger in effect than current equivalent in smaller neuts, due to what in practice is stacking penalty for cap warfare. With enough frequently cycling neuts it would still be possible to completely cap out single target, but this pushes required amount much further, while making it even easier to nuke capacitor of relatively small targets with just 1-2 heavy neuts. There might be other effects related to that, especially when it comes to more complex interaction - situations like neuting out capchained ships, capchain between unbonused ships giving cap stability at certain level and so on; it's open question if those would be good or bad. Opinions, suggestions, things I forgot to recognize?"

110,vulnerability,Eve,Citadel damage cap idea,11,6dd0dw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6dd0dw/citadel_damage_cap_idea/,2017-05-26 08:34:38,"So crazy idea today whilst clearing a null incursion. Make citadels damage caps work like the incursion site with the MTACS. Have 4 shield outpost towers at the edge of the citadel model, between them have another 4 power relays or something. During vulnerability charges from the relays can be shifted to the outposts to overload them taking them down. Each tower overloaded increases the damage cap (but not repair timer activation threshold) by 25%, overloading all 4 removes the cap completely. The charges would have to be huge and require a tractor beam to pull over to the shield outpost towers. This would ensure that a fleet with subcap superiority could effectively take down citadels faster. It also provides specific objective based gameplay other than just ""shoot the enemy, shoot the structure."" Finally it makes killing afk citadels so much faster. Thoughts?"

My recommendation is the following -Tethering Requires a service module fitted with fuel in order to work -Asset safety Remove it completely. It doesn't reward us for killing the structure. It doesn't promote fights, and it promotes people to not defend your gear stored within. -DPS cap. Increase it by double from what it is now, that way we only spend 15minutes instead of 30 shooting something 3 times over a week on something with very limited windows so we can even shoot it. -Vulnerability windows Should be set to protect your least active timezone if fueled and not force us to be limited to 3 hours of the week which are often timezone tanked by the many. -Entosis Giving us the ability to capture them or kill if we decide to shoot them. -Fittings Including service slots, as a shoot-able target that can be reffed preventing tethering, and defenses so we can rape cage Citadels, and deny our enemy retreat or their assets. -Astrahouse Two vulnerability windows. It is something that costs 1bil, which also gets spammed in space hard due to it's cheap cost. Almost anyone in this game can afford multiple astrahouses. corporations and alliance's can afford to just plop new one's down without ever hardly breaking a sweat. Make it so we can kill them with much greater ease. My views on how you devs up in Iceland should change citadels to encourage us the players to knock over sandcastles and truly ""Wreck their dreams."" I hope some players give feedback either supporting it or pointing the flaws. I am not an all knowing entity, I may be wrong with some if not many of these issues I have suggested, if so please for the love of god at least look into tweaking citadels even if it just a little. There is no longer any reason to fight another coalition when we can't do much with the current mechanics we are given. Maybe this gets downvoted to oblivion, maybe not, but please look into changing SOMETHING about citadels. "

118,vulnerability,Eve,[constructive] The story of the Beachead in Gehi - how current citadel game mechanics break the tempo and lead to dis-investment in the game,1290,6ggnbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6ggnbn/constructive_the_story_of_the_beachead_in_gehi/,2017-06-11 04:07:35,"ESTABLISHING THE BEACH HEAD In the recent weeks, Northern Coalition(dot) established a beachhead of several astras in Gehi to threaten Imperium space. This is a classic step to any war in eve and I wish to briefly describe it in order to show how citadels have changed the core flow of content and why it is leading to disengagement with the game itself. In previous days, establishing a beach head would require picking an NPC station (possibly with cloning and offices) and maybe anchoring some POSes. In this regard the Gehi beach head happened in a similar way with NC moving into the npc station and started anchoring structures. &amp;nbsp; COUNTERING THE BEACH HEAD To this, the Imperium answered in force by deploying their supercapital fleet and burning all the (3?) NC POSes to the ground, as well as the initial citadel. In previous days this would reset the beach head to barebones npc station, without all the advantages of the citadel (tethering, free cloning, infinite offices, ecc). However - the citadel dynamic massively punishes the defenders if they do not form up every day within a very short timeframe (15 minutes) to destroy all the new citadels: NC/Panfam concentrated the anchoring in AU TZ and soon were able to simply win a single timer and slip a citadel through. &amp;nbsp; THIS IS WHERE THE SYSTEM FAILS Pay attention here because this is key. Due to how vulnerability was designed, a single unsuccessful timer by Goons in this example makes the beach head completely untouchable for 2 weeks: 1 week until the next vulnerability, and 1 more week for the final timer. Due to loopholes in the vulnerability switch system, this period is actually extended to 3 weeks by moving the vuln window. **That means for 3 weeks the defenders have absolutely zero way to make counterplays or counter progress**. Now the situation is also made worse by a bunch of other factors - these distract from the point I am trying to make so I will just list them quickly: - the citadel can only be reffed in a single timezone, unlike POSes - the citadel cannot be defanged and bubble caged - the citadel has a aoe neuting weapon which forces attackers on one single viable doctrine (machs, which you now nerfed... wtf!?!?) - killing the citadel after all this work feels completely hollow as all assets teleport to safety - spammed citadels can be unanchored before the next vuln cycle with no possible counterplay - an infinite number of citadels can be spammed in any system &amp;nbsp; THE PENDULUM SWINGS BOTH WAYS So back to the original example. NC/Panfam now have a beach head established which is untouchable for 3 weeks. Where to go from here? Once again this is where the system fails: the same advantages that citadels gave the attackers also belongs to the defender's side. Beginning the eviction of a single system requires the same 3 weeks cycle and for every structure in system. Evicting someone who knows what they are doing would require grinding hundreds of thousands of citadel timers clustered around a single timezone. So the attackers are also facing the same issue. Meme timers are generated to try and force fights but any kind of serious eviction could be countered by simply spamming more structures and capitalizing on the vulnerability timers and their loopholes. &amp;nbsp; DISINVESTMENT WITH THE GAME - On the defenders side: 2 or 3 weeks without any possibility of counter play. Might as well go back to ratting. Why bother? - On the attackers side: hundreds or thousands of structures to grind just to see assets go to safety. Why bother? The result is players lose passion and become dis-invested with the game. Some simply go inactive, some turn to pve instead and grow their wallets. People get passionate about this game due to the conflicts and the pressure of defending against an invader or attacking someone else's space - but **the citadel tempo with its extremely long periods of invulnerability abruptly halts the flow of content and action**, as well as completely locking the content to one single timezone. &amp;nbsp; AND THEN YOU LOOKED AT THIS AND WENT 'GOT IT. NULLSEC PVE NEEDS TO BE NERFED )))' **The massive increase in nullsec PvE is a consequence of these broken mechanics, not the cause. What is terrifying is that you clearly searched for a solution to the problem by looking at your statistics instead of listening to the community** telling you exactly what is wrong. - you have statistics showing unprecedented increase in mining and bounties collected - you have the community loudly telling you that citadel vulnerability is killing the flow of content You chose to ignore the community and nerf pve instead. CCP Quant's statement makes this overwhelmingly clear. &amp;nbsp; OUTRAGE And there you have it. I am sure there are people out there upset about their ticks or mining output but for many content creators, this really comes down to the lack of respect by the developers, for the community and its feedback. Even though players from every side of the aisle are yelling at you that citadel vulnerability is broken. Even though loopholes and exploit with vulnerability and unanchoring have been reported to you for a year now. Even though the oppressive Void Bomb meta was lamented since it's launch... You still ignored all of this, announced some ham-fisted changes, and left for the weekend. This comes across as arrogant, unprofessional and totally disconnected from your customers. "
119,vulnerability,Eve,On CCP Devs being Out of Touch,195,6gm7w1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6gm7w1/on_ccp_devs_being_out_of_touch/,2017-06-12 02:19:46,"EVE is a complex game. Learning the very basics takes hours. Becoming just competent can take weeks and months. From a player perspective, becoming decent requires a lot of work. We read guides, we do the math (spreadsheets lol) but more importantly we accumulate experience. Getting a firm grip on EVE requires hours and hours of experience. The complexity of the game precludes just theorycrafting alone somewhere to get to the answers. Ideas have to be combat tested. There are all kinds of unseen gameplay interactions, contingencies, and edge cases. And then there are judgement calls in ambiguous situations that no spreadsheet is ever going to give you a solution to. You just have to know the answer in your gut. As an r/eve forum pvper you have probably flown in main line fleets. Youre familiar with FCs, leaders, theorycrafters, propagandists. You spend some chunk of your life immersed in the (cancerous) culture of your alliance. You know what happens on the front lines of your little corner of the game. You may never have bothered to dissect particular EVE processes. You may or may not be able to explain the intricacies of a given process on an intellectual level. But if you have been playing the game long enough, you are going to have a gut level understanding of whats going on. There is a question I rarely see asked. What gut level experience do CCP developers have in the game? Sometime in the past they may have been elite solo pilots, or PL bittervets, or FCs. But if there is one group of people who are more wrong about things as they are than plain noobies, its the veterans who quit playing 3 years ago and still insist on outdated garbage such as 10mn AB Zealots are good. This is an important question. Secondhand information is deeply suspect. If the information is gold; if the information took years of work to acquire; if the information and the knowledge is the basis on which an individual clings to power; it will be a tightly held secret. On the other hand, there are any number of people pushing really dumb ideas. An FC isnt likely to tell you detailed information on complex fleet maneuvers, particularly if it relates to the current meta. Some asshole you never met before will tell you lies, disinformation, blatant stupidity, try to scam you, troll you, and link memes into your channels. Lets not even get into how most EVE balance proposals are just garbage In order to separate the chaff from the wheat you need first hand information to collaborate the second hand information. What gut level experience do CCP developers have? This is all speculation but I have some guesses. They dont need ISK. I doubt that very much effort goes into grinding ISK, or skill points. Theres no urgency for a CCP employee to grind cash so even if they try it a little bit they arent getting the full experience. They probably dont know what it feels like to be a carrier ratter in a 0.0 alliance running from the hunters. They probably dont market PVP. For one thing, CCP employees are probably not allowed to distort the in game markets directly which means they wont know how to do it right. Actually a lot of ethical concerns are going to really constrain them. To prevent conflicts of interest, CCP developers cant openly join some big 0.0 entity. They have to basically make a spy alt. Youre not going to see CCP Fozzie openly become a goon line member. Reddit would be in arms. CCP would be accused of favoritism anytime something good happened for the Imperium. Youre not ever going to see CCP Fozzie becoming a goon FC even with a spy alt because people would eventually recognize him. CCP developers are going to have no up to date experience at all with being mid-large fleet FCs or the decision making that is required for that position. (The goon experience is only one of many. Even understanding it doesnt automatically mean understanding the TEST experience or the PL experience.) Mostly I think they do solo and small gang stuff (with other devs). Sometimes they probably get spy alts into big alliances, and may see larger scale content. But they will never see that content from the perspective of the people making decisions; only as grunts. If you wonder why CCP are out of touch its because their perspective is about the same as an elite solo small gang pilot or an Imperium foot soldier. And who knows how much time they can even devote to playing the game. There arent so many devs at the moment and they have other work to do. If you wonder why CCP havent thought through the large scale war implications of citadel vulnerability timers and reinforcement mechanics its probably because no CCP developer has had to seriously think about implementing a war in a very long time. CCP developers dont keep or lose their jobs on the basis of whether their plan to invade the Imperium works. If you wonder why CCP dont quite get the problem with huge AOE void bombs its probably because no CCP developer earns his keep designing fleet doctrines for dealing with the godawful things. I dont see a fix for this. But keep it in mind when you try to interact with the devs. Theyre not stupid. Therere also not all knowing savants. If you have good information youre going to have to work extra hard to distinguish yourself from the dross. Then sometimes they listen. And sometimes they dont. "
120,vulnerability,Eve,"WTB Content Button, or How to Fix Citadels",191,6gs7gh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6gs7gh/wtb_content_button_or_how_to_fix_citadels/,2017-06-12 23:28:30,"YES ANOTHER ONE OF THESE POSTS. I PROMISE IT'S NOT COMPLETELY STUPID &amp;nbsp; I think citadels are actually a lot closer to being non-shit than many people think. Asset safety and damage cap and all the rest come up a lot, but to be honest I don't think they're the problem. I think the problem is what Gobbins drilled-down to yesterday: they're boring to fight and it takes ages to get anything done. &amp;nbsp; (as an aside, these suggestions are directed at citadels as they function in nullsec specifically) &amp;nbsp; **Problem 1:** For a start, theyre boring to interact with because theres basically only one way to interact with them. Having to only fly machs almost exclusively is shit. The reason you have to fly machs is because of void bombs and (to a lesser extent) citadel scrams. Get rid of them. You should be able to take a viable, agile fleet comp and engage with a citadel. It might be aids to ref it that way, and you might get shit on by whatever turns up to defend it, but so be it. Right now citadels aren't so much a force-multiplier as a force-negater. A lot of the most fun and engageable and interesting doctrines interact with a citadel at their peril. &amp;nbsp; **Solution:** Get rid of void bombs and scram/webs (or at least nerf the range of the latter two) so that more interesting fleets can engage with the citadel and stay on grid without being totally crippled. Fighters, missiles, point and painters with redonk range are plenty of support for the defending fleet. Citadels will still be amazing force-multipliers that can also force off under-prepared comps by themselves. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Problem 2:** Even 3-week loophole aside, the content is NEVER on the attackers' terms. You show up for a timer in order to make another timer in order to make another timer and THEN maybe get a 1b killmail? It's absolutely atrocious. &amp;nbsp; And more importantly, if you do go to to all the effort of contesting the defenders' first timer, there is no good reason for them to bother to defend it. Why flash-form today when you can blob tomorrow, and then again a week later? The result is that the first timer is almost never contested, especially as any comp that does not get absolutely fucked by the citadel is probably too strong for a flash-form. That timer is 100% slog 99% of the time - its doing nothing for the game. &amp;nbsp; When I first joined Horde citadels still weren't a thing. We took O1Y and the blessed Goonies would show up multiple times daily to bubble the undock and fuck with the station services. It was very annoying, but this forced us to form there and then because it was a real inconvenience to lose cloning facilities etc. Roaming fleets could come to our staging and create immediate pressure by harassing the station. With citadels, even if you have a fleet that can hold the grid, all you get to do is come back tomorrow, then a week later. &amp;nbsp; **Solution:** Citadels should be vulnerable to reinforcement all the time, with the vulnerability windows that the defender chooses only kicking in thereafter. Moreover, reinforcing the citadel should switch off basic functionality like tethering and clone bays. Assets remain fine, markets remain in operation, but there is actually a price for not trying to defend the thing. If you stay docked and refuse to engage, you suffer consequences that are not insignificant, without being crippling. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Conclusion:** I think the above changes (or something like them) would turn citadels from appalling, unimaginative grinds to interesting content buttons that allow roaming fleets to provoke different kinds of content on their terms. At the same time, these changes wouldnt screw the defenders or significantly diminish the advantages of owning and staging from a citadel vs NPC stations. Citadels would still provide tremendous force multiplication, asset safety, and QOL features like tethering and clone-swapping, but instead of being an obstacle for content they would become a medium for it. &amp;nbsp; I honestly dont think these are balance-upsetting changes, and I think the benefits would be tremendous. Imagine being able to take a Ferox fleet to poke at a citadel, force the defenders to form, and then have an actual fleet fight. Or cerbs, or T3 BCs, or just some T1 cruisers with logi? If you win, you get the satisfaction of having fucked their tethering and clones for a day. Meanwhile the defender has all the benefits of asset-safety and a timer on their terms the day after. Doesnt that sound like fun? Even at the strategic level, reffing citadels starts to mean something - you get immediate progress as the attacker, and retain significant functionality as the defender. &amp;nbsp; Yes, the vulnerability window shit needs to be sorted. The reinforce mechanic was designed to last a week, but instead can last three. That is an appalling design flaw. But even if it were fixed, I think citadels would still fail to provide the kind of push button, receive bacon mechanic that would liven up nullsec. Rorquals are such a great example of this, and I think always-available content buttons are exactly what nullsec needs. Citadels can provide that without making them unappealing vs NPC stations. A bit like aegis sov, I feel theyre closer to being great than people realise. &amp;nbsp; Im not sure where exactly the balance lies, but I think that citadels need to provide more immediate opportunities for provoking content. Timers where one side has nothing to lose are bad."

CCP seems to feel that POS style always-vulnerable is too easy for the attackers. However, we've all seen the issue with current vulnerability windows. It's too easy to set a timer for the quietest times in EVE and hope nobody bothers. What about something in between? What if instead you chose when citadels are invulnerable? Say you had 24 hours of invulnerability per week. You could decide ""fuck mondays"" and veto the entire day, or decide you're not fighting in the middle of AUS TZ and veto a few hours per day instead. This gives some control to defenders over when they have to form, but gives attackers plenty of chances to attack - and hopefully produce more fights. "

Rinse repeat forever. &amp;nbsp; **But Gobbins doesn't unanchoring a citadel mean you get a chance to steal it?** Answer: Not unless the owner is legally retarded. Citadel Unanchoring mechanics are something most eve players are not familiar with and assume it works the same way POS unanchoring does. CCP designed citadel unanchoring to be much less risky. Here is a quick run down: - Citadel unanchoring does not show a countdown timer, just a [unanchoring] tag, so no way to know how much time is left - Unanchoring can be stopped and restarted any number of times by the owner. There is no limit to how fast or how many times you want to flicker unanchoring on and off for a citadel. If done rapidly, the tag does not even change on the client but the unanchoring timer is reset. This makes detecting the start of unanchoring completely useless since the real start point can be anytime later. - Citadel owners can always decide to abort the unanchoring process if the timer is about to count down and someone else is near the citadel. - Unanchoring initiation and reset can be done remotely from anywhere in system. - *and lastly...* Unanchoring can be started *before the citadel is even done anchoring* - this is key because it means the 7 day countdown actually becomes a 6 day countdown - making the citadel unkillable &amp;nbsp; This combination means someone can initiate citadel unanchoring and then reset it a few hours later so only he could ever know when the citadel can be scooped by his neutral alt. Anyone else would have to camp the citadel for hours or days and can still be denied the citadel by last minute cancellation of unanchoring by the owner. This denies the counterplay and risk involved in citadel unanchoring in empire. The other element of denied counterplay is that empire citadels are almost impossible to kill during the initial onlining. Normally, citadels are most vulnerable during the initial onlining. This is when a citadel can be killed in a single timer. However in empire this vulnerability does not exist because the 24 hour anchoring time is cancelled out by the 24 hour wardec time, leaving just 15 minutes to spot a new citadel and wardec it. &amp;nbsp; **So... How does this make an empire citadel invulnerable (tl dr)?** In a nutshell, it lets the owner scoop his own citadel back before the citadel ever becomes vulnerable. This means a 100% citadel invulnerability to wardecs. The 100% wardec immunity works for both existing (anchored citadels) as well as new citadels being anchored on alt corps. &amp;nbsp; NOTE: this exploit can be performed *regardless of the other loophole mentioned above*. Both loopholes can be combined to make the exploit require even less effort but currently any upwell structure with &lt; 23 hours of weekly vulnerability can be made invulnerable without even needing to exploit the ""changing vuln schedule"" loophole. &amp;nbsp; Also apparently if you play eve for 8 years it's ok to cheat your way out of wardecs URL"

The concept of Citadels, and their vulnerability, was wrong from the beginning. They should be tied to the design of system conflict and capture mechanics. Now, since you made null sec sov mirror the Factional Warfare theater capture system, I will also recommend the fix for null as I would for FW: have the Citadels anchor on and replace the iHub. Keep all existing capturing vulnerability windows and throw out the Citadels timers out. Good riddance! Now in Null, to make it more fair, require the TCU to be brought into vulnerability first and as a prerequisite to the iHub entering reinforcement, but allow the steps to reinforcement remain available for iHub capture points so that they can be strategically timed to go into reinforcement the moment the TCU is destroyed. Of course, limit the number of Citadels any one corporation can have to 1. Consider it the flag planted on the ground. Anyone not planting a Citadel over an iHub will not mind that it maintains its existing EHP once it is attacked. Now Citadels have their special roles and can once again become a coveted possession and lure into sovereignty warfare. They are too good and too useful to be anything else. Either they get nerfed or they be given their proper role. We are just going to be playing with tweeks that change very little and make a great structure not so great anymore. This limitation should bring station building back to where it was."
127,vulnerability,Eve,Contesting citadel control in FW (probably a bad idea but whatever),1,6209ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/6209ux/contesting_citadel_control_in_fw_probably_a_bad/,2017-03-29 03:07:16,"So people have been ranting over months how citadels in FW are unbalanced as they allow a faction to work around system control, are cheap and hard to take down, and void the point of controlling a system to an extent. While as a solo FW player I don't really give a fuck about citadels other than appreciating those dank freeports, an idea has crossed my mind nonetheless. I figured I'd share it, even if just to know why it is not a good idea. The idea is that, for any citadel anchored in FW space (3rd party or militia), militias will be able to fight for docking rights in a similar way they fight for system control. This is supposed to be easier than taking down the citadel (less so for citadels belonging to a militia), but still hard enough to not fuck over defenders. The citadel would spawn a number of plexes around the system (constellation?), and each time the attackers won the majority of them, they would advance to a stage with fewer plexes, and this would go on until there is only one left, which is the structure control plex. In a similar way, each time the defender wins a stage, the conquest would go back by one step (so winning the last plex would spawn three plexes, of which the attackers must win two to spawn the final plex again). Ideally, without no defense, an M sized 3rd party structure could be taken within hours, whereas a well defended L sized militia structure is a long drawn out process with the odds stacked at the defender's side. In the case of 3rd party citadels, it is pretty straightforward. The winning side gets militia-wide docking rights, the losing side loses any docking rights they may have, and for everyone else it's just usual business. The owners retain every right over their citadel, except they can't deny the current occupiers docking rights or grant them to the opposing side, until the occupiers lose citadel control. When a militia loses a 3rd party citadel, it goes back to the initial stage along with any modifications the owner may have made, and can be contested again. When a FW corp loses control over a citadel, they remain the owners, but their rights are more limited. They can't dock (duh), can't deny opposing militia docking rights, can't unplug modules, and can't unanchor. They can manage docking rights for 3rd parties, set vulnerability timers, man the citadel if they have left someone in; and opt for no reinforcements, in case they feel the need to get rid of ""their"" asset. The controlling militia can in turn fuel and use the service modules, but they don't have any other rights; partly because it is not an individual corp holding it, but the collective militia. When the citadel flips back, the owner immediately gains full control. The citadel can later be contested again. Anyway, I have elaborated more than enough for someone who gives no fucks about citadels in FW, but I might as well make a case for it. If contested citadel control is bad, this idea could be modified with extended vulnerability timers. But then again, 3rd parties can't have that, and militias are surely not anchoring citadels without an alt corp with such a mechanic. Dunno. Edit: Apparently it is a too complicated solution for a simple issue at best. Thanks for the feedback."

When you think about marauders, you likely think about facetanking a fleet on a gate with bastion Mr Hyde style. While they're great at that, they're vastly overshadowed by carriers and HAW dreads for the same price after insurance, as many Reddit threads have pointed out lately. Most people don't realize marauders are capable of much more than bastion and F1 gameplay. The strongest bonus on marauders is actually not the ability to fit bastion, but one line of text hidden next to something about tractor beams. &gt; 70% reduction in Micro Jump Drive reactivation delay This bonus turns marauders from the stationary dreadbait most people know them for to *the* most mobile battleships in the game. Normally a microjumpdrive will move a battleship 100km every 189 second or, 529 m/s added to the base speed. The microjumpdrive will move a marauder 100km ever 63 second, or 1,587 m/s added to the base speed. The Golem has the lowest base speed of 969 m/s with just a microwarpdrive. Add the 1,587 m/s from microjumpdriving for a total of 2,556 m/s, and you're suddenly racing past a Machariel with two nanofibers and HG Snakes. Here's a [video](URL demonstrating the insane mobility of marauders. Of course having over half of your speed in a microjumpdrive has both advantages and disadvantages. The biggest disadvantage is the reduced effectiveness from speed modifiers such as Snakes and nanofibers. Fitting a nanofiber to marauders is a complete waste of a slot. Another big disadvantage is vulnerability to probes and on-grid warping. It's difficult to quickly pull range like a Machariel if someone lands on you. On the other hand, the biggest advantage is how deceptive the speed is. I don't think a single person I've ever fought realized how fast marauders go. They see less than 1,000 m/s on their overview and start approaching with a cruiser fleet, slowly forming a nice long line for me to chew through from one end. If they knew I could easily outspeed all of them, like they would know if I flew a Machariel, they'd never engage. The second big advantage is how unpredictable you are. If someone's out of position, you can instantly be there. Or somewhere else. It's up to you. The biggest disadvantage is also a big advantage. Can't fit nanofibers? You're already go fast enough. Webbed by a Huginn? You don't care. Kill the target and o7 in local. What makes marauders really shine over similar ships like the Machariel is the insane utility. With three high slots, you can have two heavy and a medium neutralizer. If someone's catching up to your marauder, one or two heavy neutralizers will reduce their capacitor to zero. The medium neutralizer's cycle time will ensure their capacitor stays at zero. This works equally well offensively. Time your microjumpdrive and lock so you appear next to your victim as you acquire lock on them, instantly nuke their capacitor and enjoy your defenseless kill as everyone on grid tries to figure out what just happened. The bastion module must also be mentioned. It should only ever be used offensively to remove Falcons and equally annoying E-war ships. It might be tempting to go in brawling when you're winning and you can tank everything on grid, but you never know who has a cyno fit. Marauders are the biggest dreadbait in the game, and you must be aware of this. A fleet might fight and feed to your marauder in the hope that you'll bastion for just a minute so they can cyno in. Defensively it is a great tool. Unlike a Machariel, if you get tackled, everything isn't over. With minimal tank fit, you can still tank 2k with a drug and heat. Until they light a cyno. There's also the [bastion plus microwarpdrive](URL trick to escape sticky situations. Here's how I fit my marauders to give you some ideas: [Vargur, Super Daredevil] Damage Control II Reactor Control Unit II Republic Fleet Gyrostabilizer Republic Fleet Gyrostabilizer Republic Fleet Gyrostabilizer Core X-Type 500MN Microwarpdrive Dark Blood Heavy Capacitor Booster, Navy Cap Booster 800 Domination Heavy Stasis Grappler Large Micro Jump Drive Dark Blood Warp Disruptor Gist X-Type X-Large Shield Booster Corpus C-Type Heavy Energy Neutralizer Corpus C-Type Heavy Energy Neutralizer Corpum A-Type Medium Energy Neutralizer Bastion Module I 800mm Repeating Cannon II, Republic Fleet Phased Plasma L 800mm Repeating Cannon II, Republic Fleet Phased Plasma L 800mm Repeating Cannon II, Republic Fleet Phased Plasma L 800mm Repeating Cannon II, Republic Fleet Phased Plasma L Large Projectile Metastasis Adjuster II Large Projectile Metastasis Adjuster II Hammerhead II x5 Acolyte II x5 The Vargur is the best solo marauder and should be flown like a really big Daredevil. Skirmish around until someone's out of position, then pounce on them, nuke their capacitor, web them down and shred them with tracking bonused 800mm autocannons. If you're a lower tier pilot without Projectile Weapon Rigging V, you can fit a faction Reactor Control Unit instead of T2. Best flown with Snakes. [Paladin, Super Oracle] Dark Blood Heat Sink Dark Blood Heat Sink Dark Blood Heat Sink Centus C-Type Large Armor Repairer Sentient Signal Amplifier Imperial Navy Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane Imperial Navy Energized Adaptive Nano Membrane Core C-Type 500MN Microwarpdrive Large Micro Jump Drive Dark Blood Heavy Capacitor Booster Shadow Serpentis Tracking Computer, Tracking Speed Script Mega Pulse Laser II, Imperial Navy Multifrequency L Mega Pulse Laser II, Imperial Navy Multifrequency L Mega Pulse Laser II, Imperial Navy Multifrequency L Mega Pulse Laser II, Imperial Navy Multifrequency L Bastion Module I Corpus C-Type Heavy Energy Neutralizer Corpum B-Type Medium Energy Neutralizer Corpum B-Type Medium Energy Neutralizer Large Energy Locus Coordinator II Large Energy Locus Coordinator II The Paladin doesn't have the midslots to function solo, but it makes for the best small gang DPS ship in the game. 774 DPS @ 93+16 km with Scorch and 152 km lock range allow the paladin to truly abuse the microjumpdrive to constantly reposition and stay out of danger. Add an Orthrus and Keres to make up for the lack of tackle and anti-support and you've got yourself the deadliest trio I can imagine. It's a big Oracle with more mobility, more capacitor, more range, more utility, more everything. If you're a lower tier pilot without Energy Weapon Rigging V, you can downgrade the neutralizers to lower deadspace or even faction to make it fit. Best flown with Ascendancies. [Golem, Carebear] Damage Control II Caldari Navy Ballistic Control System Caldari Navy Ballistic Control System Caldari Navy Ballistic Control System Core X-Type 500MN Microwarpdrive Republic Fleet Target Painter Dark Blood Warp Disruptor Federation Navy Stasis Webifier Gist X-Type X-Large Shield Booster Dark Blood Heavy Capacitor Booster Large Micro Jump Drive Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launcher, Caldari Navy Inferno Cruise Missile Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launcher, Caldari Navy Inferno Cruise Missile Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launcher, Caldari Navy Inferno Cruise Missile Caldari Navy Cruise Missile Launcher, Caldari Navy Inferno Cruise Missile Bastion Module I Dark Blood Heavy Energy Neutralizer Dark Blood Heavy Energy Neutralizer Corpum A-Type Medium Energy Neutralizer Large Ancillary Current Router II Large Ancillary Current Router II The Golem is the jack of all trades marauder. It slightly worse than the Vargur at solo and slightly worse than the Paladin for DPS. Cruise missiles apply near perfectly to cruisers as long as the cruiser is webbed thanks to its bonused target painter. The web requirement isn't a problem for solo, but as a long range DPS ship it can be annoying. For solo it has significantly less raw damage than the Vargur, but it can apply damage better in certain situations you really don't want to be in such as being swarmed by frigates. The Golem truey shines as a [PVE](URL ship. It can do most DED sites easily by Microjumpdriving and spamming cruise missiles. A Golem running a DED site will also attract a lot of attention from pirates who are eager for an easy loot piata. What they don't realize is all of the microjumpdrive drawbacks listed above don't apply in deadspace where probing and warping is disallowed. They are now in your domain, and they don't even know it. I made most of the ISK to buy my Chremoas running lowsec DEDs with a Golem. The frequent PVP encounters not only kept me sane, but more often than not paid more than the DED itself. The Golem is a jack of all trades, so implant choice depends on the situation.

The Vargur and Golem is better at facetanking a fleet due to capless weapons and tank. It can't skirmish like the Golem and Vargur with only four midslots. Railguns can't compete with Scorch for kiting. It's in desperate need of a 5th midslot or the old 90% web bonus to be viable. At least it has a really cool police skin, but even that is getting [nerfed](URL &amp;nbsp; In conclusion, marauders are very strong ships with unique bonuses and roles, but they're very skill intensive requiring perfect situational awareness and planning on top of piloting skills and a lot of module management. They're also fairly expensive and skillpoint intensive. They're fun and powerful endgame ships for solo and small gang PVPers and any changes made to ""fix"" them will either make them broken or kill their current roles."

Sources have informed The Daily Tripe of not one but TWO further successful Rattlesnake deliveries. Pilots (who wish to remain anonymous due to being ""on the register"") have leaked delivery reports confirming 2 pilots, friendly to the leading wormhole delivery service WiNGSPAN (WDS) made not only successful deliveries to two battleship class hulls, but further extended their services to needy Scythe class hulls who involved sources say ""Yeah, Ill just have some chips with the.... sorry, who are you and why are you interrupting me?"" Pilots friendly to the well-known elite delivery company confirmed that due to a structure vulnerability window, two Rattlesnakes and one Scythe found themselves the unsuspecting recipients of munitions delivered straight from the citadel. After the first Rattlesnake fell victim to the mighty Cerberus, a second Rattlesnake was checked using the online ordering system to ensure the correct delivery was received. Despite one of the friendly pilots explaining ""I don't fucking know how to launch fighters?"", deliveries were made via proxy and despite hostiles confirming ""fuck this, I'm off!"" the second Rattlesnake was found (despite internal SatNav directing the pilot to the nearest high-sec wormhole) and premium products, for which the ""OK'est Delivery Company"" in New Eden has fast become known were made. Although this particular delivery required additional agents, following internal communications leaked to The Daily Tripe showing calm and collected requests for ""get the fuck here' and 'help me you bunch of pricks!"", deliveries were made despite fellow agents best attempts to arrive at the customer, following replies of ""Go fuck yourself"" and ""Is anyone on the high sec?"" Following previous operations, CONCORD are now concerned WDS may make a move for a monopoly on the delivery industry, prompting comments from senior officials saying ""Who the fuck are WiNGSPAN?!""

133,vulnerability,Eve,[Idea] Structure Bombs,40,5y27ty,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5y27ty/idea_structure_bombs/,2017-03-08 05:07:28,"TLDR - Time bombs that bypass attack phases and blow up undefended Citadels and ECs. I've seen a lot of discussion about the survivability of Citadels and ECs and I fall on the side that they're maybe a bit too hard to kill, at least when they're undefended. Requiring a week's worth of effort to kill a derelict Astra seems kind of lame to me and I'd love to see more squatter structures go boom. So I came up with the idea of structure bombs. Structure bombs would be a new, deployable item. The idea is that anyone can mosey along and set one on a cita/EC after a short deployment period. Only one can be set on a structure at a time. When this happens, a one week timer starts to count down on the bomb. The owner then has to notice the bomb, go out during that week some time, **only within their vuln window** or the last x minutes of the timer, and disarm it. It shouldn't be difficult to do, I wouldn't even be opposed to being able to do it while tethered. If the timer counts all the way down, the bomb explodes and so does the structure. No shield/armor/structure timers, just boom. To add one final bit of spice to it, the countdown is visible to anyone that happens upon the citadel and bomb just like the current vuln timer. When the structure enters the next phase of vulnerability, and again the last x minutes before it explodes, anyone can show up and flip a switch on the bomb that snipes the killmail from whomever set it. Some benefits that this might provide: 1. First and foremost, massive lulz when no one notices a bomb for a week on a Keepstar and it goes boom. Even if this never happens (it shouldn't), the potential for it is amazing. 2. Discourages hundreds of structures being dropped all over space for squatting. You'll have to put a tiny amount of effort into your structures now instead of dropping them and forgetting in a less annoying manner than fuel. 3. Forcing the defender to disarm the bombs during the vuln window adds a little bit of incentive to not play tz games. 4. Making the timer visible in space along with the ""last touched"" mechanic can change an otherwise useless and derelict structure into a potential series of fights between third parties. 5. Citadel gunners can get more work blapping would-be bombers. Further details could be hashed such as how expensive they should be, whether different sizes are required for different sized structures, whether larger bombs should take up more volume and require larger ships to deploy, etc. But I just thought I'd throw this out there to get other takes on the idea. Thanks for your time. Edit: Formatting "
134,vulnerability,Eve,Citadels are broken. Here's how to fix them.,0,5yg498,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5yg498/citadels_are_broken_heres_how_to_fix_them/,2017-03-10 03:43:47,"So, we are all aware of the issue of citadel spam and the massive defensive advantages they all offer. What I'm proposing is a system that rewards groups who actively utilize their citadels, but penalizes groups who don't. What do you think about ADMs, but for citadels? Groups who use their ~~space~~ citadels get defensive advantages. Groups who don't use their ~~space~~ citadels will have defensive penalties, such as perhaps you have much more vulnerability time as well as only one (or two) attempts needed to destroy one, as well as a reduction of (or, just for un-utilized citadels, outright removing) the DPS Cap. This means that Citadels would reward groups who actively live in their space and use their assets, but penalize groups who don't. The way you would grind down a Citadel being actively used is either by attacking it with overwhelming force 3 times, (which is not doable for a group of equal strength, which encourages nullsec gathering into large blocs. I know, I'm a goon, a hypocrite etc. But a stagnant game isn't a fun game.) or a longer campaign waged by a smaller group to prevent the enemy from using their space, degrading the ADMs and then reducing the 'home defence advantage'. This would be interesting warfare requiring a real commitment from the enemy and their pilots, with a tangible objective: Wear down the enemy's ADMs so they can fight on the Citadel. The 'max' ADM would be what they are right now with 3 attempts needed to destroy one, but depending on the size you would need either a small corporation for an astrahus's Max ADM, for a fortizar you would need a medium corporation or an alliance, and for a keepstar you would need a coalition or a large alliance."

I consider myself a newbro, my total play time by hours prob well under 100, so most things in eve I have never done or experienced. My friends and do, however have decently well skilled characters (20-50k) and decided to try and carve out some space in WH space. We loaded up, looked for a good spot and found a nice comfy empty c2. After playing for a couple of days we realized that no one had checked the planet far out on the edge of the system, well out of the 14Au scan range. When we got out there much to our surprise, a freaking abandoned citadel! The Corp who owned it had been inactive for over a year give or take. This looked to be like an awesome pay day! After waiting a couple more days the vulnerability timer shows up, we get off work early and get it down into hull over the course of two days. On the final day everyone shows up an hour before the final vulnerability timer. We login and our hearts sank. Over the night a wormhole I had opened six jumps from jita and a large Corp. had moved in for the kill. With no way to challenge them we watched as they destroyed the citadel and made off with all the loot. This is the most fun I have had in eve since first playing the game back in 2013.

137,vulnerability,Eve,PSA: Hi-sec Citadel invulnerability loophole (3 weeks guaranteed invulnerability),279,5qt8wo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/5qt8wo/psa_hisec_citadel_invulnerability_loophole_3/,2017-01-29 21:41:41,"This loophole exploits the vulnerability change mechanics and the wardec delay to make an empire citadel unkillable for 3 whole weeks. &amp;nbsp; 1) The citadel anchoring must start on a Monday, or late Sunday. 2) Have your citadel ready in the cargo hold of an npc corp alt, logged off at a safespot 3) Log in, join or create an alt corp, and immediately anchor the citadel 4) Set vulnerability to Monday from 01:00 eve time to XX:XX eve time (for example, 01:00 to 17:00 for a azbel) **Now unless your random anchoring alt gets wardeced within 15 minutes of the citadel anchoring, you are scott free for 3 weeks** 5) If nobody wardecs you within 15 minutes of anchoring, the citadel will be already invulnerable by the time the war dec goes active, since it only takes 24 hours for a citadel to anchor in empire, and then it has the normal 15 minutes structure timer before onlining **Recap: Your anchoring is now completed. Since you started the anchoring on late sunday/early monday, it is now late monday/early tuesday and the vulnerability time of your citadel for this week has already expired, so you are completely invulnerable until next monday. 6 Days of invulnerability.** 6) Change the vulnerability window to Sunday night eve time. Because vulnerability windows are only updated at Monday 00:00 by the server, the ingame vulnerability will still have your citadel invulnerable on sunday and show ""secure"" until the original Mondy vulnerability you had set. 7) When the new week starts however, the server updates the vulnerability, which is now late Sunday. Your normal scheduled vulnerability of Monday is now skipped and the citadel has become secure for one more week (until Sunday). This is because unlike sov vulnerability switching, changing the vulnerability of a citadel does not make it vulnerable in both timezones for a week, but simply shifts to the new vulnerability as soon as the ingame clock ends the week (sunday 23:59). **Your invulnerability just extended to 13 days before the citadel can ever be shot at.** 8) The enemy can now hit your citadel on Sunday for shield timer, Armor on Monday and then can finally kill your citadel on the structure timer one week later. That means your citadel will die on the **third** sunday after anchoring. **Final date at which your citadel can be killed at the earliest: 20 days from anchoring.** 9) By then you should simply anchor another citadel using the same trick, and be untouchable for another 3 weeks. You may transfer all your assets to this new citadel by just hauling tether-to-tether untouchable, or you can wait 5 days for assety safety at zero cost if you are really lazy. &amp;nbsp; Advanced: The clever among you may have noticed that there is no reason to immediately change the vulnerability time as soon as the citadel goes online (Step 6). You can wait out until Sunday 23:59 at the latest to make the decision. This means if you do not get wardec'd, or if you are wardeced, but the enemy did not form at Sunday night, you can simply stick to the original vulnerability, and be able to repeat the trick the following week. **This means that, by default, you always want your empire vulnerability to be set for early Monday**, and then simply change it if you get wardeced. This guarantees you a minimum of 7 days (and a maximum of 13 days) citadel invulnerability in the event of wardec. *Example: Say it's Friday 13th, you check your empire alt corp and there's a new wardec from a large mercenary group! You are clever and have your citadel vulnerability set to early Monday - so you log in and switch it to late Sunday. When the wardec goes active, there is still Sat 14th, Sun 15th, Mon 16th, Tue 17th, Wed 18th, Thu 19th, Fri 20th, Sat 21st of invulnerability before they can fire the first shot at your citadel on Sunday 22nd, and the final structure timer won't be until Sunday 29th. Plenty of time to finish jobs, evac, or look for help.* **TL DR: In empire, your POCO or POS can be shot at anytime and then killed within the next 48 hours - however if you are smart it will take at least 20 days to kill your Citadel. This is due to a combination of citadel's narrow vulnerability window, the wardec delay, and vuln switch mechanics. Basically it is possible to game the system and make your structure survive for 3 weeks no matter what.** &amp;nbsp; PS: u/CCP_Falcon that's 2 in a month can we get a cut of your QA's budget please? Beans need new shoes. &amp;nbsp; edit: to break down the mechanics that allow this to happen: 1. (critical) A citadel anchors 24 hours after it is deployed, but wardeccing someone takes 24 hours which means the effective window to ""catch"" a new citadel being anchored is only 15 minutes 2. When the citadel vuln window is changed, it skips any vulnerabilities on the older schedule. This is unlike the Sov system where changing vuln means 1 cycle in which both vulnerability windows are open. 3. The vulnerability schedule changes at a fixed arbitrary time (end of week) rather than a defined number of hours after the change is submitted. (again unlike sov) 4. (generic) Citadels total vulnerability window are really short so they can all be squeezed in a single day or less, allowing for the system to be gamed"

It's arguably worse than grinding POS structures. However I don't think the issue is inherently with the DPS caps but the fact that the astrahus is probably the most OP structure in the game. In nullsec it takes over a week to just get rid of one even after you've taken the system unlike outposts which can be taken over, and the owner still gets all the important functions out of it until the last second before it explodes. Swarms of astrahus are being put down in nullsec and each one is a pain in the ass to uproot and if you miss a timer congrats you get to start over Increase the DPS cap to where it only takes 5 minutes to break undefended Either drop the 3rd reinforcement timer to 1 day in all space and not just whs OR flat out remove it and give it only 2 RF timers Increase the vulnerability window frequency Thoughts?"
148,vulnerability,Eve,The Math (AKA why you'll likely never see a sieged Rorqual in the belt),111,50gg4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50gg4n/the_math_aka_why_youll_likely_never_see_a_sieged/,2016-08-31 20:08:18,"So I decided to see how powerful the Rorqual's siege mode will be in the belt with the new boosts, to see if it would ever be worth siegeing one in a belt. After all, folks on reddit are all ""gotta risk it to have to best"". Siege mode. 5 minutes stuck in nullsec is a very long time. It's enough for most fleets to burn 4-5 jumps, come out of a WH, etc. Just like a dread, you will have to accept that when you click that siege button, there is a good chance you will not survive to see the end of your cycle. It's something dread and triage pilots have long accepted. So let's go into this assuming you are risking losing your Rorqual every time you siege in the belt, which is a fair assumption (I think). Since mining is almost always done as a for-profit, isk making venture, the only reason to siege a Rorq to provide extra boosting power is if the potential cost of losing your Rorqual is lower than the potential gain. This is where dreads and triage differ slightly, since most times a dread or triage is entering siege, it is for PVP. Now, the cost of a Rorqual. On TQ you can probably expect to pay around 2.2bil for the hull. However, most/all of that is insurable, so just the cost of insurance and fittings then. Platinum insurance - **678,203,827 isk** (zkill estimate) Fittings - (Likely to include a few capital mods, T2 Indy Core, etc) - **around 200mil.** Let's call it about 900 million isk or so. Cost of clicking Siege: **900mil + 600 Heavy Water**. Now, what are the benefits? Well, since we're already risking so much isk in the belt, let's not skip on the mining barges. Let's use Perfect Hulks, with the 5% implant, and let's only mine the Best ores (Arkonor/Bistot). With the new changes, a Perfect Hulk will mine 272,090m3 every hour with a perfect sieged Rorqual boosting. While you might consider that you'd need to haul all that ore, you have a compressor in the belt with you in the form of the sieged Rorqual, so that is the actual amount. Of course, since an unsieged, and safely aligned Rorqual gives the Perfect Hulk enough to get to 208,096m3 every hour, the difference is **63,994m3/hr** for having your Rorqual sieged. Keep in mind that this is with the best possible mining ship, not anything with a tank. We're looking at each siege cycle in turn, we need to chop that up into five minute chunks. **(63,994 / 12 = 5333m3)** So, by siegeing our Rorqual for a Perfect Hulk, we are gaining about 5333m3 worth of ore. At the time of writing, Bistot is worth about 365isk/m3 for a miner with a good refining rate and perfect skills. So, **5333 * 365 = 1,946,484 isk** is what we gained from a hulk by putting our Rorqual into siege. Dang. But! Boosts are not meant for just one ship! How many Perfect Hulks would we need to make up for that 5 minute risk? **900,000,000 / 1,946,484 = 462** Perfect Hulks and some change. You can't actually fit that many into a fleet. I realize that was a bit silly, but I hope it illustrated the point I was trying to make. A more realistic example in nullsec is a fleet of 20 skiffs, so let's look at how long you'd need to siege your Rorqual for a fleet of 10 skiffs to make up for the loss. A single skiff in 5 minutes gains **3519m3** from a 5 minute cycle. 10 skiffs would gain: **3519 * 10 = 35190m3** In addition, the Rorqual also does the work of hauling/compressing while it's in the belt, which should free up a couple pilots driving Miasmos back and forth to a compression array. So we'll tack on a full 2 extra skiffs for that benefit. **35190 + 14963.5 * 2 = 65117m3**. Now, a proper fleet is not going to be able to sit for long and just mine bistot and arkonor. So the ore value dips to around 310isk/m3 to mine a whole nullsec belt. **65117 * 310 = 20,186,270 isk**. Okay, that isn't too horrible, right? We just have to run our Rorqual for 45 cycles! How long is that? **3 hours and 45 minutes.** That's completely vulnerability. No chance to leave if neuts show up, no chance to be aligned, nothing. Almost 4 hours in nullsec is virtually a death sentence. And that is literally just to make up the cost of the Rorqual in the first place. It doesn't mention the Rorqual's pod, the lost boosting time due to having to build/replace it, and so on."
149,vulnerability,Eve,[Dev Blog] Introducing Clone States and the Future of Access to EVE Online ~Team Size Matters,211,50hcek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50hcek/dev_blog_introducing_clone_states_and_the_future/,2016-09-01 00:06:45,"URL [image](URL [image](URL Immortal Capsuleers, Today, we have something exciting to share with you; our plans for a new feature that will let both old and new players take part in EVE Online for free. This is a big, fundamental change to the way EVE works, so wed like to go over the high level concept, some reasoning for it, and the kind of help we need from you to make it solid. Then, at the bottom of the blog you can find a full QA section which addresses points not covered in the blog itself. This feature is built around the complex biotechnology which originally gave rise to the capsuleers: clones. Technological advancements in New Eden have led to a new way of manufacturing and augmenting clones, unlocking the possibility for a variety of distinct***Clone States*** . With this technology, clone manufacturers can now build and distribute clones which possess a base state, the Alpha state. They can be enhanced or otherwise altered to achieve other states, but the Alpha state will always exist underneath. The state of a given clone may affect its access to trained skills, its ability to train new ones, or the rate at which new skills are acquired. When we launch later this year there will be two clone states available: * **The Alpha Clone State** is the new base state for all clones and it will be available to any character in New Eden at any time. Clones in the Alpha state will be able to train and use a specific set of skills including tech one Frigates, Destroyers and Cruisers for your faction along with essential weapons and modules. Alphas will also train skills at a reduced rate compared to Omegas. * **The Omega Clone State** is obtained by augmenting basic clones using neural expanders and cerebral acceleration technology, granting unlimited skill access.Omega clone state will behave exactly as your subscribed characters do now. Your clone state will be determined by your account status. Characters on subscribed or PLEXed accounts will be granted Omega state, while Alpha state will be given to characters on any unsubscribed account. You probably have a lot of questions already, and we will address many of them here, but lets start with some discussion about why we are excited to make this change and why were making it now. As you know, EVE is a very special game. Our single shard server means that every player truly affects every other, whether through economics, resource gathering, direct combat or bad posting. This in turn means that our universe is more interesting, more exciting and more dangerous with each additional citizen. Just like you, weve known this for a long time and, just like you, weve been doing everything we can to bring more people into our spectacular sandbox. Part of our vision for the future of EVE has included more open access for some time, but with the interconnected nature of the game comes vulnerability. We knew that if the flood gates were opened in the wrong way, we could see anything from server meltdowns to the collapse of the EVE economy. Over time, our hardware has improved, code has been untangled (mostly!) and weve found a design we believe in. EVE is ready for this. Lets dig into that design and how it really works. ##**Clone States In Depth** ## First of all, accounts wont be changing much. Every account has three character slots. One of those slots at a time may be used to train skills. One of those characters may be logged in at a time. Account services such as PLEX, Multiple Character Training, and Skill Trading will be completely unaffected. As described above, any account with an active subscription(paid directly or via PLEX) will have all its characters upgraded to Omega state.**Omega can be summed up in a very simple way: It works exactly like subscribed accounts always have.** Alpha State, on the other hand, will be much different.**The most important thing to know about Alpha clones is that they may only use a specific set of skills and skill levels.** To begin with, we are planning that the Alpha skill set will be focused on using tech one Frigates, Destroyers and Cruisers. Alpha clones will only be able to use ship and weapon skills native to their faction. If you have skills trained on a character in Alpha State, which are not part of the Alpha skill set, those skills will be locked and unusable until Omega state is reactivated. Characters will start the game with the same 400,000 skill points as they do now and will be able to train freely within the Alpha list. Afully trained Alpha will have roughly 5 million skill points. You can find the full Alpha list in the QA below the blog. By specifically selecting skills in this way, we can ensurethat the EVE ecosystem and the value of Omega state are both protected, while still providing a wide-ranging, exciting EVE experience for Alphas. The clone state prevents access to powerful skills like Cynosural Field Theory and Cloaking, and limits farming through skills that control scaling and efficiency. We are also able to react to unexpected issues by refining the Alpha clone skill list further, should the need arise.Of course, Alphas also have enormous freedom. They will be doing everything from rampaging null sec in Caracal fleets to exploration sites in high sec to playing a major role in faction warfare. [image](URL Along with all the system changes described above, we want to make sure that the game itself does a good job showing where skills, items, certificates or activities require a certain clone state. For that reason, we are doing a hefty update to the skill section of the character sheet as well as adding new iconography across the client to let you know exactly what each state can do. Heres a work in progress shot of the new skill window and an Alpha looking through an inventory with some Omega required items: [image](URL *(click to enlarge)* *[image](URL Many players coming back to check EVE for free will have played before and they might have last logged out in any number of situations which an Alpha could never have found itself in, like behind the wheel of a Titan for instance. Again, check out the QA for more detail, but our general approach in these situations is going to be very hands off. We wont be moving ships around or cancelling your jobs and orders. Instead, benefits from skills that require Omega state wont be applied and modules requiring those skills will go offline. The design we're describing is based on the combined effort of all of us here, but we need your help to make sure the Alpha experience is the best it can be. We need to hear how you think Alpha state will get used, especially if theres obvious problems. We need to get the set of Alpha state skills tuned very carefully. And we also need to know what we can do to support you as a wave of new players come to the game looking for a home. The CSM heard about this concept just a couple days ago--basically the same time you are, but we are communicating now specifically so thatthey can help gather your feedbackand bring it to us for the summit in September, where we will be flying out the entire CSM for the first time. If you would rather talk to us directly, the forum thread for this blog is a great place to start and we will be opening up other channels, such as a Reddit AMA, in the coming weeks. "
150,vulnerability,Eve,"Alpha Clones vs FW, or Fixing Farmers Before It's Too Late",336,50s4xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/50s4xg/alpha_clones_vs_fw_or_fixing_farmers_before_its/,2016-09-02 17:46:31,"This isn't a complaint about Alpha Clones in general, because I do want newbeans to be able to try EVE out, and hopefully experience and enjoy lowsex. I like the idea of Alpha Clones, and I want FW to be an enjoyable and experience-able option. FW helps new players out by paying them to seek out PVP, which helps them afford all the ships they're inevitably going to lose. However, FW already gets a bad rep for the farmers and non-PVPers that populate space, who most actual FW players don't want around either. This problem will only get worse if changes aren't made to the mechanics that encourage farming behavior, though, and new players and veterans alike will be driven away. This is a thread on FW, why it's broken, and why Alpha Clone alt armies will ruin the little FW we have left if one simple change isn't made. **TL;DR 1: Alpha Clones in a Tier 4 FW militia could easily net ~50-100k+ LP per hour per character *deplexing*, with almost 0 isk cost and literally 0 upkeep cost. For the defenders, this is directly comparable to if Concord paid incursion-grade income to anyone who entosised *your* sov space, and gave you hisec belt ratting payouts for equivalent time and effort.** To top it off, it's literally more AFK-able than mining, and one human player could easily run 10+ plexes/nodes simultaneously, without having to pay for any of their alt's subscriptions. **TL;DR 2: This entire mess can be solved by decoupling the militia Tier system from the FW plex captures.** Specifically, the non-bonused, non-penalized Tier 2 payout rates, rather than the -50% penalty or +150% bonus for T1/T4. This doesn't negatively impact dedicated players with alt armies trying to affect the warzone, but it would serve to equalize the appeal of every militia, so that saying ""the farmers affect both sides"" would be accurate roughly all the time, rather than simply meaning whichever side is winning at any point in time. I'll first extend an analogy that our sov-null friends can appreciate by drawing a somewhat lengthy comparison to Aegis-sov. Aegis was, in part, adopted from FW: small localized fights over buttons scattered across a region. This works for FW because, by its own nature, FW is small in scale compared to everything else. From the limited amount I've seen, where Aegis either fails or succeeds, the primary factor seems to be player count in a given region. That's not the topic of this thread though. Imagine if Concord paid players to capture entosis nodes, where [a single Tristan pilot](URL could get paid 25 mil isk per entosis capture for sitting in any of your systems capturing your stuff, with no vulnerability window limitations. Not only is he allowed to warp off mid-capture if he decides he doesn't want to fight you or your fleet, but in order for you to undo his efforts, you have to spend an equal amount of time sitting on the same button in order to reset it, let alone capture it yourself for the defense. Also, unlike Aegis entosis mechanics, if you leave the site and he returns to the button, he resumes his capture exactly where he left off. There is also no multiplier in either direction, so the time for him to capture is almost exactly the same as it would take you (though, you also have to undo *his* progress before you can start capturing it for yourself). Since this is your system, you already have the advantage, so Concord decides it's worth 0.5 mil isk to fully capture one of these nodes in order to help return stability to your system (and only because this is a few jumps from home - if this was your home system, expect 13k isk, and no, I'm not exaggerating). Note that if you manage to capture the Tristan, whether by cornering him or catching him on a gate (remember, lowsec has no bubbles), he's only worth 800k isk on a killmail, which, after insurance, costs him less than 500k to replace. If you have even a single T2 module fitted, your ship probably costs more than his. What if that one individual Tristan pilot decided he wanted to do the exact same routine, but with 10 multiboxed accounts? **If only a single entosis cycle succeeded, and he lost every single ship, then in 10-15 minutes, he still nets at least 20mil, which is better than an average ratting tick.** Should half of those entosis cycles succeed, and still be blown up, he's still up 120 mil for 10-15 minutes of work. Granted, that's a lot of accounts, and he'd have to buy plexes for them all, which would add up to circa 10 bil per month, which is a base line of ~20 hours per month before he'd even turn any profit at all... unless they were Alpha Clones, so he could do this exact process without paying a single dime of account upkeep. If it were this way for localized content, sure, maybe. I'm personally of the opinion that Aegis-sov's biggest failure is the size audience it's trying to cater to (it might work well if ""large alliances"" were a few hundred members big, but it obviously doesn't work for sizes 7,000+). But what if players from the other side of the galaxy decided they wanted to entosis all of your sov - again, with no significant investment on their part, and with negligible killmail glory for your part - simply because Concord were handing out LP for them to do so? Maybe this would be bearable for a few days, even a couple weeks, but for months and even *years* to go by, where the game of tug-of-war has a guy on the sideline paying onlookers money to come over and help whoever's already winning? **This is what FW has had to deal with for years**, with the only difference being that accounts are not yet F2P. When we complain about farmers, this is why. When pirates rag on FW because it's nothing but stabbed farmers and runners, it's because they get paid in such gross amounts to do just that: sit in plexes and avoid fights. Sure, lots of us provide fights, and are in FW for the pewing, but many players find that if they're patient enough, they can make more isk/hr by simply avoiding fights, no matter what they would be. I'm not going to rant about the issues surrounding Aegis and what could be done to fix them, because I don't live or play in sov null, although my brief experience in TEST last summer can be summarized as ""this feels like FW, except I'm spending money and avoiding fights instead of earning money and taking fights."" FW mechanics, in general, are designed to support small scale PVP, where a ""big-ass fleet"" of enemies might have 20-30 guys in frigates and destroyers. On the smaller scale, FW plexes themselves promote fights where, as long as the person inside is paying attention, PVP engagements are as consensual as can be, short of using a sign-up list, or dueling outside of trade hubs. The majority of solo PVP happens around FW space, and part of it is because plexes are deliberately designed to make big blobs difficult, among other factors. Sure, you can and should always expect the enemy's friends to be nearby, but most fights are quick and dirty, you won't have cynos go up so supers can blob you, and you generally know who all might show up before you decide to engage or not. In Aegis-sov, some of the reported cancer has been from ecm, ecm bursts, interceptors, and, generally-speaking, avoiding tough fights in favor of just capturing another node somewhere else. In FW, we have a different cause that leads to the same gameplay, which is that the payouts are extremely skewed in favor of whichever side has more systems, and since the reward is for capturing the plex, farmers can rake in the big bucks for capturing as many of these as they can in as short a time possible. It's a good idea to reward the side that is winning the war, but the entire sway of the war is affected primarily by players who have no intention of participating in the actual warfare component of FW. **In the Amarr-Minmatar warzone, for at least the past two years (that I've been able to bear witness to), the only reason ownership has shifted towards either direction has been because defenders quit, which leads to the winning side getting bored and quitting because there's nothing left to shoot, and then the defenders return after the winning side's ISK/LP ratio has gone down the toilet.** The primary reason the defenders quit is because the imbalanced proportions of ""free-labor"" farmers who de-incentivize the PVP aspect. It's beyond retarded when a PVP-ready fleet forms on a Friday night, stays plexing-and-pewing until 3 in the morning, goes to bed, wakes up, and sees all their work and more undone by a few guys with a couple alts each in unfitted or stabbed slashers who got paid more LP in less time by doing less work with fewer characters. Alpha Clones will make it even worse, because at least with an alt army right now, you have to pay for it. But what happens when FW farming alts become entirely free? * Even with the restriction against having multiple Alpha Clone clients open, that doesn't stop virtual machines or compatibility-mode switching. Dubbing these tactics as exploits and leaving them up to CCP's support team to respond to will only clutter up their already limited resources, so that's no good. * If Alpha Clones are blocked from doing FW, then that completely defeats the point of trying gameplay out. This would be a terrible choice, and one that hopefully CCP refuses to even consider. * Should no changes at all be made to FW, and Alpha Clones are granted regular access, then it will be even easier for unaffiliated and non-interested third parties to roll plexing alts, which will not only provide a negative experience to the new player directly, but will also even further abuse the veterans that still remain. I'd love to see newbros in fleets being told about how FW is fun, worthwhile, and self-sustainable, not about how F2P accounts (like the ones they'd be on) are the worst things to ever happen to FW. This would hurt my very soul but would be inevitable without any mechanic changes. And if you don't believe me on the efficacy of Alpha clones and capturing the warzone - after all, there was a thread supposedly rebutting the notion that they'll suffice as ganking alts - [how about if I provide some fits for you?](URL Fully tech-1-fitted Gallente ships are dirt cheap, can be manufactured by the hundreds at mineral cost (most of which is refunded through insurance), and can solo o-plex novices, smalls, and mediums with significantly less player input than the infamous hisec retriever. If it weren't for the cost associated with PLEXing each alt's account, we'd have seen these already en masse, but Alpha Clones will remove that barrier to entry. * [841k ISK Tristan](URL Launch drones, orbit beacon, go AFK * [2.23m ISK Algos](URL Launch drones, orbit beacon, go AFK until you hear the rat attacking you, then F1 and go AFK again * [14.9m ISK Vexor](URL Same tactics as Algos, plus 2 warp core stabilizers for good measure *Note that these cost approximately 400k, 1.8m, and 13m LESS isk to replace than they provide on the killmail, as almost the entire cost is absorbed by platinum insurance on the hull. No hub prices would crash or likely even be affected, because it'd be trivial for a player to manufacture these himself by the hundreds.* FW needs a rework all around - every single other component of EVE has received significant updates more recently than FW. The only thing FW has gotten in recent time was a few scramming and webbing rats in missions, which don't really effect anything except for there being fewer bombers and more Vexors and VNIs. Here's just a small list of a few gameplay areas that have received significant attention and/or where CCP have listened to player's complaints more recently than FW: * Mining * Industry * Sovereignty * Ratting * Missions * Incursions * Wormholes * Exploration * Ganking * Hauling * Corp/alliance management * New Player Experience I'm sure there are a few others as well that didn't make the list. The last time that FW received a game-changing update was about two years ago, when they made site rats respawn and they nerfed stealth bombers in plexes. These did help in solving a symptom of the farmer issue, but they did nothing to address the cause, so now we still see griffins and stabbed slashers/thrashers. Basically, **FW would be a better place if plexing payouts were decoupled from the Tier system, effectively being locked at the T2 rates.** T2 is considered base-line, non-penalized, non-bonused payout, whereas T4 receives 2.5x as much LP for doing any of the equal activities, and T1 receives 0.5x as much LP. Tier 2 payouts are enough to pay the bills. Players wanting to multibox to mass capture parts of the warzone will be able to do so, with the winning side having greater isk-making opportunities through mission running. But pure farmers won't completely imbalance the warzone so drastically, filling space with their dishonest clutter - and maybe they'll even go to more traditional PVE-oriented gameplay, which would increase FW's PVP-vs-PVE ratio. I'm not against alt armies affecting the warzone. I'm not necessarily against AFK-able FW gameplay. Decoupling the LP payout is not the end-all, be-all solution to fixing FW, and farmers will always exist so long as there's money involved. But if new players are supposed to enjoy FW, they can't be getting shafted in every possible way simply because the race they decided looks the coolest and most fun to play just happens to be on the losing side of the war, nor should players for the warring race be completely spoiled by the boatloads of free LP for nearly zero effort or investment. Edit: Just a final clarification: This is not meant to be the redeeming savior of FW. It would only be a band-aid. But it might well be the single best band-aid that FW will ever see."
151,vulnerability,Eve,One little wormhole system,130,53apgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/53apgb/one_little_wormhole_system/,2016-09-18 14:03:29,"I love Eve. Tonight was all the proof one could ever need of why its so hard to go back to neatly packaged themepark mmorpgs after experiencing sandboxes at their best. Yeah, this is long, not very exciting to read, and I freely admit I stink at this game, but I wanna tell the story of what happened the last twenty four hours. So, here I am, tiny wormhole corp living in a c3 (from a pos) with a null static, where I make my money in the game to buy ships and do fun things. Finished up a site last night, and then boom, astrahus on the overview. With no warning, no staging, and no visible ships at any time, someone dropped a citadel in the hole I was calling home. A small corp (but bigger than me) had decided to try out wormholes and that was the first one they had found. I tried to roll them out late that night after they were caught outside the system in null, but they had the sense to have an emergency heron standing by. They had more people/accounts and ships than I did, and didn't seem too shy about just muscling into the system and taking it over, though they weren't really vicious about it. So I asked here for mercs, a thread a few of you saw. I wanted to get rid of that citadel when it came out of its 24 hour anchoring. Many people responded (and I thank all of them for their interest). One of the smaller groups wanted to come and make an event out of it, so I agreed to pay them to come, would tell them where the static was on saturday, and it seemed to be all good. I went to bed with just the null static around to worry about. This afternoon after work, I log in to find out that I was now grand central station. I had a roaming highsec hole, connected to a c4 held by an active medium sized German (I think?) alliance (edit: SORRY I thought they were German for some reason, they are not!) called Einstein-Rosen Brigade and a c2 with THREE highsec holes in it along with connections to the rest of the chain. There were people everywhere, and *every single one of them had seen that citadel anchoring* for about 1:15 Eve time tonight. There was no question of trying to get hole control in a zoo like that, it was just hunker down, cloak off all the wormholes, and see what happened. I don't know how many corps learned about that citadel because of those connections. ERB knew right away, of course. Their dozens of trips through my system to the highsec was more than enough for that. They drew the attention of Hole Control, a decent sized and very active chain roaming alliance. The fight took place over both my system and ERB's but I think Hole Control baited their fleet in and then walked away with a flawless victory. About 75 minutes before the citadel was coming out of anchoring, suddenly the group I had got to come in to bash the thing backed out. The guy I was talking to said they were busy doing black ops drops, so sorry. Not good... With almost no time left to find someone and get organized enough to actually get to me, I found someone else from the aforementioned reddit thread (GHOUL) and they agreed to come. At exactly the same time they joined my conversation invite, someone from another group in that thread actually came into my wormhole system completely independently and just as they answered my conversation invite too, a rather bizarre coincidence. This group, MCAV, is yet another PvP wormhole alliance who would have been willing to take down the citadel. They indicated they were jousting with Lazerhawks further up the chain and didn't know if they would be able to come, and since I was out of time, I went ahead and asked GHOUL to do the job. However, it was also clear that MCAV was fully aware that there was an onlining astrahus in their chain and there was high probability of a fight. So, we had me, the citadel owners, ERB (who never stopped peeking in even after HOLE had wrecked them), MCAV, and GHOUL all aware of the location of the onlining citadel, and maybe even Lazerhawks knew, though I never saw them come in myself in the hours leading up. And so begins [Thunderdome in J152333](URL Besides me and the new locals, the first one to arrive at the citadel was MCAV in VNIs, setting up just before GHOUL's variable ship fleet arrived. They had combat probes and quickly landed right near them and GHOUL was quickly in trouble. Most of GHOUL were killed or driven off. Midfight, ERB starts attacking in bombers. This is all going on while the citadel is being shot, and its owners are shooting at my tiny contribution and anyone who got too close. GHOUL is forced off the field, and now MCAV sets about trying to destroy the citadel, when the last group, the seventh group to fight over the system in about a five hour stretch, attacks. This was Catastrophic Overview Failure, COF, who had been roaming further up the chain and had, like so many others, discovered the citadel onlining earlier. They came in Cerberuses. While COF and MCAV came to a temporary agreement to kill the citadel (which was now down to just two minutes on the vulnerability timer) before fighting, for some reason COF changed their minds and piled in when the citadel was almost dead. ERB also made more bombing runs as this was happening. This was the final fight of the night, and it was mostly a draw, with both sides moving off. COF killed a bunch of ERB on their way out and that was that. The citadel survived. This wasn't some epic B-R brawl with thousands of people, or a massive campaign with supercaps everywhere. Six gangs, plus me, mostly in the ten to fifteen ship range (besides me and the citadel owners who were much smaller). It was HOLE vs ERB vs GHOUL vs MCAV vs ERB again vs COF with minor players on grid and groups like Lazerhawks nearby. Great small fleet content from start to finish. It really felt like what Eve was supposed to be like at its best. No one knew at the start of the night that half the active wormhole corps in the game (so it felt like) would put in appearances either at or near the system in question at almost the same time. People followed the content other people were making and it snowballed from there. Nothing preplanned or prepackaged, just taking the chaos as it comes. It was the kind of night that keeps people subscribed. "
152,vulnerability,Eve,Are Astrahusess too cheap/too much of a hustle to destroy?,26,53hstl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/53hstl/are_astrahusess_too_cheaptoo_much_of_a_hustle_to/,2016-09-20 00:29:01,"Okay first of all: I'm just a ~5M SP noob and don't have a firm grip of large scale PVP so I'm 100% talking out of my ass so feel free to downvote this into oblivion if I'm just wrong (although I would love to know where I'm totally wrong). *Warning: Badly written 4000 letter epic incoming, tl;dr at the end.* Okay, an unfit Astrahus costs roughly 1.2b ISK ...for a newbie like me that might be a lot but i figure it really isn't...yes thats just the base price and you can spend more than that additionally on processing rigs etc but I was primary thinking about the defense capabilities you get for that price + maybe 300M for basic warfare modules and rigs. So as far I understand it you can drop that 1.5b ISK, find a nice calm place in 0.5 or so and with some luck don't get wardec'ed 40 times before your 15 minutes of potential terror come along. But if you got through that it takes serious committment for somebody to pop your private station: Make time to play during the small vulnerability window, raise a force capable of stopping the repair timer and grind down the shield for which you need at least continuous 1667dps (yeah thats actually not *that* much) but after that you need to be able to do that again for the armor 24 hours later. After that you have to wait 6 days (unless this happens in a WH) and repeat the process to finish the thing. Yes, getting 1667+ dps isn't that much of a deal (at all) but coming back a day later and then 6 days later kinda is, I get why reeinforcement timers are necessary but given the price of the Astrahus this seems like quite an effort to destroy a structure - especially if you consider that once the final vulnerability window opens half the region might decide to show up (at least when you are in highsec) and assuming the Citadel isn't in some strategical important place - the owners would be pretty dumb to let you salvage anything outside the hull + potentially rigs if it became clear that they don't have a very high chance of succesfully defending it, so there isn't much to gain outside whatever it being gone might be worth. Additionally: I'm not a roleplaying guy at all but I want things to make *some sense*, i get that being able to repackage a 486.000m^3 Megathron to just 50.000m^3 is necessary for this game to be somewhat dynamic without requiring carriers to be size of moons (which in itself would royally fuck up the believability or balance) **BUT** being able to compress a *61km* large structure down to fucking 10.000m^3 is just ridiculous, said Magathron is 5 times bigger when compressed and that thing is just 1km long. This might being a try hard bittervet but it feels wrong that I could carry the 2 structures with the size of a city in an Iteron Mark 5. I might be way of with this but I think even the Astrahus with its limited capabilites compared to the Fortizar or even Keepstar is too cheap or at least to much of a hustle to kill, its price should be around 4-6b ISK or it should have a bigger vulnerability window (with perhaps double the price) . If it would be vulnerable 6 hours/week like the Fortizar is now (which then might be vulnerable for 9-12 hours maybe?) having a defense fleet available might be more pressing which would some limit to Astrahus inflation in highsec. ...additionally: Why not require a freighter to move/deploy it, yes I get that complicates the deployment in WH space but given the protection such a location gives from attacks that just seems fair - and this is just a personal preference question but I would love to see at least the Astrahus being much smaller, perhaps 15-30km , moving it in the area of a Titan - it not really being a ""city in the sky"" and more of a village which i think fits better with its capabilities, I think size should *to some extend* reflect capabilities and value. . **TL;DR:** Wouldn't a price of 4-6b ISK for an Astrahus and or with a longer (6h?) vulnerability time (then 2-2.5b ISK price) be better for balancing the effort needed to destroy them with their price. Additionally: Why so big (61km) for a stored volume of 10.000m^3 which seems to small for a station anyway? Wouldn't be a stored volume closer to a 50-200.000m^3 be more appropriate combined with a size of (15-30km)?"

154,vulnerability,Eve,Citadels - The Good and the Bad,5,4un98y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4un98y/citadels_the_good_and_the_bad/,2016-07-26 16:29:02,"Since the release of Citadels in the early spring of this year, there have been a whole host of them deployed. People in Eve really love them, as four known Keepstars have been anchored, slews of Fortizars, and enough Astrahuses now populate space that they might as well be Pidgeys in Pokemon Go. With all of this however, we should analyze what it is that citadels are aiming to do, and how it is that they can be adjusted, fixed, or nerfed in certain ways in regards to their abilities. **First and foremost, the good:** * CCP did a very good job by making them accessible to people that want to put them down. No more bullshit on waiting for downtime to sneak a station in system, no POS inefficiency going on. It's nice to see that their rolloutw as relatively smooth, inasmuch that nothing technically BROKE in weird and interesting ways. There's something to be said when every small corporation in Eve is clamoring for these new badboys, and they certainly have been very popular. * No dumb racial fuel stuff going on. Simplification of the fueling process for citadels is very nice, considering that racial fuel blocks are the death of people who want to do something other than have racial POS setups matching their region's ice spawns. * They are already generating content when people scrap over them. Mostly over when they are in the process of anchoring, but also afterwards as well (but this will be touched upon later). Really fun to bash one and get a nice killmail out of it, and wreck their dreams. * DPS cap. This might be contentious, but holy shit CCP you did something pretty good here. Now, there isn't the ability for one side to just dump fifty thousand supers on something and instantly blap it after a few hours of fighting. No pointless repping either, only to have your work undone, which was a major gripe for me in the Dominion sov system where you absolutely HAD to go out and rep structures, sometimes for hours if you didn't have triage, only to see it evaporate from you in a few minutes from a dedicated and trollish enemy (hello PL). * Undocking. Pretty cool I guess. Nice to see ships tumble out of all those different ports on Fortizars, and also on Keepstars. Managed to make the station undock congaline just a little bit nicer to look at. **But with all the good, there is also the bad:** * One of the chief issues that we have is the vulnerability windows on these things. While Keepstars get a 21 hour vulnerability window a week, Astrahuses and Fortizars are significantly lower. While this is great for stopping the constant structure bash spam that could erupt during a Dominion era sov war, what is really, really dumb is the fact that to bash some of these structures, you have to be up at the most insane hours, or have an incredibly narrow band of time to attack them. This is the case as well no matter where they are anchored. This is very troubling, because it means to attack them, you have to attack in a very short amount of time, which is not nearly as long (in most cases) as the vulnerability window given to structures from the dominion era sov mechanics. This makes it hard to lay siege to an area, which can be painful enough as it is without inflicting these seemingly arbitrary mechanics onto players just trying to kick in the door in some places. **Let me say that I do understand the nature of citadels as a defensive emplacement meant to be longstanding structures. This does not mean however that it should be more difficult to siege an Astrahus than it is for a POS at the moment. It is rather confusing as to why it has been set up like this.** * ADMs do nothing to affect their vulnerability window. While it is still very early in the process of deploying citadels and the new structures (hell, we don't even have the Industrial Arrays that are promised for this fall tentatively), what is rather shocking is that the Aegis sov system that was deployed last year has been utilized to zero extent in regards to citadels. Having the ADMs affect the vulnerability windows for the new citadels would be nice, because as it currently stands, you merely have to place the citadel down for it to be untouchable outside of that narrow band of time. This makes it extremely easy to hypothetically spam citadels in the event of an insurgency (like how Goons tried in the north), and make them essentially untouchable. Additionally, this makes offensives against citadels that much more difficult considering that not everyone can afford to have a multi-TZ megacoalition at their back to strike at citadels in RU or AU tzs. Pretty self explanatory. ADMs are the current lifeblood of this iteration of sovereignty, so it would be nice to see them actually be used for these structures. I figure that if CCP doesn't touch this issue now, there may be a day sometime in the future when you can buy Fortizars for 5 billion a pop and spam them as often as people spam Astrahuses right now, knowing full well that these forward staging grounds cannot be easily touched. * Capture mechanics. While citadels are fun and all to blow up, I sincerely hope that CCP will allow us to capture Fortizars and Keepstars one day, rather than just blow them up. While incredibly fun to burn down assets and the like, taking these citadels and rebranding them or preventing the enemy from having them would be fantastic to see. **In short, the issues that I have with the Citadels as they stand are as such:** 1. Vulnerability windows are very, very narrow. 2. ADMs do nothing to affect vulnerability windows. 3. Entosis modules do not have a role in the new system. These issues are primarily for a simple fact: Citadels are essentially castles among the stars for the fields and the farms of nullsec. Unlike castles, though, they are only able to be torn down, and each one of them is as impregnable as the day they were set down, even without defenders manning them. **Optimally speaking**, what I'd like to see is that they can be captured and that the citadels anchored in an alliance's space could be given a bonus for the ADMs of the system, considering the fact that soon^TM ADMs won't matter as much because every structure will be destructible and the like, including the current stations that exist in nullsec. Spitballing at this point, but I'd like to see citadels have a standard vulnerability window if they are not in owned space that is a bit longer than the current ones that we have (twice as long and twice as often, perhaps?), and have the ADMs matter in the vulnerability and possibly the defense of them. Fuel bonuses on citadels would be nice, a benefit of owning sov, and I would also enjoy seeing ability to capture them (though I do want to be on a Keepstar killmail someday soon). On another note, really excited to see what CCP is going to do with industrial platforms in the near future, kind of hoping they won't be terribly expensive but we will see. So what are your thoughts on citadels as they currently stand? Are there other mechanics you would like to see changed (outside of known tethering and desync bugs)? How do you envision citadels being? What do you think is good about them as they currently are? Most importantly, how am I most wrong in my assessment?"
155,vulnerability,Eve,Helping a bro out with his hole (SFW),156,4xmt40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4xmt40/helping_a_bro_out_with_his_hole_sfw/,2016-08-14 14:55:27,"tl,dr: Alliance mate gets Astrahus and threats thrown at him in his wormhole. Some bros rally and wreck Astrahus. I feel good about myself and EVE. Text wall: Recently, a friend in my alliance came on comms to share with us that some guy had apparently shown up in his wormhole, dropped an Astrahus, and then after it had anchored told my friend he had to leave. He proceeded to tell my friend that he'd better leave, 'cause he (the interloper) had friends ""high up in Mercenary Coalition."" This might have been a credible threat, I guess, except that my friend - and me, and everyone on TS at the time naturally - are MC. My wormhole friend explained that he'd have been happy to share the wormhole - it's just him and a few RL buddies in there, plenty of room to share - but given what had transpired conflict appeared inevitable. On TS, we all agreed that removing the interloper and his unwelcome citadel was the correct answer. My friend explained that that it was an issue, because he had IRL commitments when the (already anchored) Astrahus' first timer came out that coming weekend. An exceptional but relatively junior corp-mate volunteered to lead the effort, knowing it would mean a 7am alarm on both the coming Saturday and Sunday. He's not an FC and had only recently graduated from Noir Academy, but he's one of the most impressive pilots I've met in my 3-4 months of playing the game. We'll call him ""Fred"" because I liked Flintstones when I was a kid. Without ping power, Fred asked those of us on TS who might be able to help hit the wormhole that coming weekend. And for the next few days, he got the word out that we might need a few guys to help out, off the books if you will. For context, Mercenary Coalition been insanely busy the past few months, and there's been very little time for anything other than contract work. (This is a good thing, and part of why I joined MC, but it complicates situations like this.) For the first citadel vulnerability window, Fred was able to solicit the help of about ten guys. Ten guys who all flew a strat op the day before the op, and would be flying another the day of. Scouts, and a mix of Confessors and Assault Frigs and Logi Frigs. We dropped scouts on the hole entrances, and I left an alt on the high sec hole that had popped up. 8 of us warped to the citadel as it entered vulnerability and started firing. A few minutes later, the owner showed up in an inty, hurrying to dock in his citadel. The owner manned the citadel, exposing us to the pleasures of neuts and webs. Pleasures which were a little more problematic when six more buddies in fast movers showed up, five docking, the other remaining at a perch in an inty. Soon, a Svipul, Armageddon, Vexor, Onyx and Drake undocked. An experienced FC who'd kindly agreed to join the wormhole defense coordinated our small fleet, and we were able to take down both the 'Geddon and the Drake on grid with some timely logi and strategic warp-offs. The Onyx, Svipul and Vexor warped off, and one of the scouts soon called the two of them landing 50km off the hole. We naturally pursued, landing at optimals and adding two more to the killboard. During the melee, the Onyx landed on the hole and escaped. We were sad to see him go. We returned to the citadel, and continued applying DPS, pausing the timer with less than 5 minutes to go. At literally the same time that we applied enough DPS to re-pause the timer, my alt sitting on the high sec hole got ""plus one"" in local, followed by a cerb on d-scan. He landed on the hole at zero, and our fleet in the hole scrambled to warp to the other side to engage him. After sitting on the high sec side of the hole for about a minute, he warped away to a station that was, fortuitously, about 13.3 AU from where my alt was at the worm hole entrance. The wormhole fleet warped back to the citadel, applying DPS and re-pausing the timer with below 3 minutes remaining. At the same time, high sec local spiked. I reported ""plus five, no more like ten...no...plus eleven."" And then saw 11 cerbs on my long scan. Shortly after, three more in local. Hurried corp check confirmed ""elite high sec mercenaries"". vOv A wormhole veteran in the fleet warped to our buddy's citadel in the hole, grabbed a rolling battleship (I don't fully understand this - believe it's a battleship somehow fitted to expedite rolling a wormhole connection). He talked through what he wanted to do, and the acting FC approved it. Having checked their fits, I think we would have taken the fight - but it wouldn't have been possible to do so and also finish the shields on the citadel before the timer ran. Mission first and all that. So we rolled the hole. Within seconds of the hole collapsing, and cerb fleet warped to 0...to nothing. (Well, except my alt staring at them.) I really should have filmed it, was quite impressive. The salt in local was real. We finished off phase 1 of the citadel, ending the fleet on a high and enjoying a good chuckle as I copy-pasta'd local into fleet chat. The next day, nearly twice as many MC bros rogered up to help hit the fleet. We fully expected ""elite high sec mercenaries"" to be a little more prepared this time. We had more scouts, rollers on standby, and more DPS. Though it was great to see so many guys take time out of their lives to help out our wormhole friend, the only action we saw was our friend the Onyx deciding to warp (presumably from a safe) to the only wormhole exit that wasn't bubbled. It wasn't bubbled because it led to a wormhole that was bubbled on the other side. He got caught, a half dozen of our guys took a small Confessor/Assault Frig detachment to add him to the killboard before heading back to the citadel. A short while later, it was down to structure and we were done for the night. Now, I'd love to be able to write about the fantastic final-timer fight we got. But that would be a lie. Instead, what we got was something that makes me feel great about being in Mercenary Coalition. We had two strat ops that day, and a big one scheduled for the next day. A lot of us were exhausted. Despite that, and expecting a spirited final-timer defense, almost 50 MC guys volunteered their time, fleeted up, and finished off that Astrahus. It wasn't just that the whole thing was handled just as professionally as a strat op with full intel, scouting, preparation, all of it. It was that a bunch of guys with stuff to do - in game and IRL - felt it was important enough to support a bro's wormhole operation on the side that we sacrificed that time and rallied to support him. He doesn't make a ton of isk there, but it's a place he can play with some RL friends, and that's worth sacrificing my time for. And clearly, I'm among people who feel the same. I've played EVE for 4 months, and flown with MC for 3 of them. I joined because of a reddit poster who wrote about their professional culture, one without b/s, without racism, without children, basically. I've done everything from small gang to big fleets, surrounded by amazing pilots and led by excellent FCs...and I've tried to suck just a little bit less every time I undock. It's been a fantastic ride so far and I'm excited to see what the future brings."
156,vulnerability,Eve,Counter Point to seraphs counter points to Capri,1,4yzivm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4yzivm/counter_point_to_seraphs_counter_points_to_capri/,2016-08-22 18:12:48,"Edit: said piece of seraph URL Seraph I generally enjoy your reading. Since they are mostly your personal ramblings I consider them entertaining and a great insight into the mind of a fellow player. But the critique you write here is absolutely wrong. And makes me wonder if you even read the entire reddit thread. First of the comment is capri made is at first not even aimed at the mechanics. It is naturally escalated there because of the growing unrest in the community. The first comment is based on a CCP employee wanting to use the big fight as a marketing tool. Capri rightfully so finds it distasteful. So did I, you are using a playstyle for marketing purposes that has virtually died out. Bad way to do marketing, period. Because the Chances of multi trillion isk fights happening with super caps have deminished over the years. Now you can obivously and rightfully say on what I base that knowledge. Well that takes me to World War Bee. The LARGE WAR you claim showed that thing are not so bad. I beg to differ on all accounts named in your critique. World War Bee was as much a war as it was a absolutely boring grind fest. All the major fighting happened on POS grinds. The Land Owners decided not even to barely defend the SOV because it was to bothers some and opted to immediatly abbandon there sov so they could try a counter attack method. If that is not the most obvious sign of a system that is utterly and completely broken I do not know what is. Then to further add to it. No major capital battle happenend during the war. On to the Phoebe mechanics. We can all agree that we needed changes there. But without solid data given t us by CCP we will never exactly know how many people left because of it. So claiming that its not that bad. Or that it was a absolute exodus. I know people who have quit because of it however. But I am still here so thats the counter point because I didnt leave. But I do wanna add my own part to phoebe. Which is the fact that instead of doong it delicately and testing it our propperly with several focus groups they decided to use a sledgehammer and just wing it. Which probably led to more players leaving then would have otherwise happenend. Also deciding to make something suchs a absolute pain to move you need to plan it days ahead of time and actually make time to do it is not compelling game play. So I personally think CCP made a huge mistake there. Its still a game. It should not be easy but its also still a game and should be entertaining somehow. Your next claim is that capri is just thinking from a post phoebe dominion sov point of view. First of the point of half SP dominion sov was a point made by many different players including Capri Now its fair to say that A NC. Member or PL member or even a goonswarm member might be looking from that perspective aswell. But I think the perspective is more of a recent experience point of view. Which I will try to explain. Aegis sov also named Fozziesov after at the moment the controversial and disliked Dev CCP fozzie has a inherit flaw in it. We went from Dominion heavily favoring the defender to a attack centric system. You say its a good thing 3 people can take sov. A lot of other people including capri and myself say. Why is it compelling gameplay or good gameplay 3 people can take sov? Nullsec is supposed to be player empires! As is marketed but a system where 3 people can take sov invest 80 million in ships doesnt say. Well this is a system I can build a empire on. Then comes the point that that defender spend significantly more time fixing what a few did with no isk investment whatsoever. To me this shows a inherent flaw in the system. Secondly anything attacker centric flawed if you want people to build empires and willing to invest real time and effort into holding. Hence the entife CFC just abbandoning there homes because the quickly realised it would be easier to counter attack then actually defend there home. Then we come out to setting vulnerability timers. Which by a large amount of consensus seems to be a bad thing. Personally its nice knowing when something can be attacked because it makes defense more feasable. But as a counter point I would continue to say. That doing that leaves entire weaker timezones in a disadvantage to attack and sometimes even to defend. This is something I personally feel was a lot bettef in the old system. The Sov Block Units. They generated a killlmail which people like. And more importantly its forces a vulnerability within a set window for people to fight in. Which is way more dynamic. Of course the OLD SBU took way to long t anchor and online. But I am sure that very dynamic gameplay could have been developed out of the SBU that could work in a new SOV system. Also immediatly claiming the nullsec focus groups are inherently BIASED to there old game play styles in not a fair assumption. Because a lot of young groups already entered sov. And again without CCP statistics on focus groups or even any form of feedback is not a good claim to make. Because someone has a NC. PL or goonswarm ticker doesnt mean they are BIASED towards that old system. All groups have dynamic members along side static member with that group for years. I am however not gonna provide counter points to Citadels. My personal experience with playing with them is to small. What I do know is that fighting with big ships ln a forizar or a keepstar is a very very bad Idea. And again discourages people of using big stuff because if you are 100% sure you are gonna lose something you are also not going to use it. Everything in game should always have some form lf counter CCP usually has that part right. If it works that a whole other thing. But most systems have a counter to it. Big ships on citadel grids is just a bad idea especially if you can do it with small ships. So why commit bigger more expensive stuff? I small personal ramble of mine on ships in general. The game would also be healthier if mechanics and gameplay was better balanced. If CCP wants to market big fights make sure that you give the tools to let them happen ln occasion. The bifger the ships used the bigger the chance people are willing to get even bigger ships involved. I am ofcourse hinting towards battleships. With very little of them being used in actual warfare in nullsec because of there inherit weakness agaist Bombs. So even though CCP has been doing a great effort into continues rebalancing. There lack of responding to absolutely neglected (battleships) or way overpowered ships (svipul) is absolutely bad for the game I personally feel people are willing to adapt. But the systems currently in place is so absolutely badly done that people are like well Fuck it. I also personally feel CCP needs to take a hard long look at the devs and evaluate if they are in the right positions and if they feel eve is in the right position before using half measures marketing plows to generate a little income. Which wil have people quit again because something they thought existed in game happens so rarely that they do not even wanna bother with it. Thats just my points on your critique. I am not a well versed writer but I do hope I got my points across."

What I believe to be the *middle* obviously won't be the same for everyone, just keep that in mind. ***** ##The Good - **Broke up the rental empires.** *See below: Forces owner to defend space claims.* - **Allowed for smaller entities to affect Sov.** *This has been something Ive wanted to see for a long time, however Corporations still may not claim sov, which seems like a mistake.* - **Singular, large HP structures are no longer the focus of the Sov system.** *This is a double edged sword, large HP structures were a focal point which caused massive battles yet massive server stress which CCP was unable to cope with. It also meant that a single battle could decide the outcome of a week long siege of a system.* - **No more SBU trolling.** *SBU trolling, at its height, was a travesty for any involved.* - **Forces owner to defend space it claims.** *This helped break up the giant rental empires as the holding alliance was typically filled with administration alts, not combat alts.* - **Use/Activity based defense index.** *This has been asked for, for as long as I can remember.* ##The Bad - **Entirely based around countdown timers.** *Everything is a timer now, from shooting Citadels to running timed cycles on an entosis target. Weve always had timers in Eve but weve nearly removed any kind of activity that doesnt involve a timer at some point. Probably another double edged sword.* - **Allows for the reinforcement of assets with little to no risk of assets on the part of the attacker.** *There is no real risking of assets needed to begin a siege. This is very much a parallel to dropping SBUs to start a siege, there was no real risking of assets, apart from the SBU. No combat = bad sov system.* - **Encourages mass reinforcement.** *While the activity based sov system helps to lessen this if the owner is actively using the space, it takes far less effort for an attacker to reinforce a system as it takes for the owner to defend it once reinforced. If an attacker only has to spend 15 minutes to RI an ADM 1 system, it should take a single defender no more than 15 minutes to entosis nodes to return it to safety whilst nobody is actively attacking the claim.* - **DIScourages deployment of assets to win timers.** *When you start deploying capitals to nodes, you get a penalty for the cycle time of the Entosis mods. I know they wanted to make these fights more spread out and more skirmishy, but this discourages, to a high degree, escalation of forces. Dropping a larger ship on a node is one entity attempting to militaristically dominating that grid, which I kinda thought was the point of Eve and Sov...to get into fights.* ##The Ugly - **System encourages avoiding fights in favor of lazoring structures with Entosis mod.** *Toasting Recons are a thing. You begin toasting a node and cloak up when something comes into local or close to the system, there is little risk. (Ive done a fair amount of Rapier toasting.) The entire system revolves around lazoring a structure, not fighting with others. The side who finds and toasts more structures than the other side wins. While there is an element of military dominance in effect here, the nodes spawn too far apart to really create any real flash points.* - **Its far more effort for the defender than for the attacker.** *While an attacker spends {x} amount of time reinforcing a system, the defender must spend approximately four times that resetting the system. Anecdotal evidence: I once, uncontested, reset an ADM 1 system in PB, it took me about 45 minutes to an hour to win the timer but it only takes 15 minutes to RI an ADM 1 TCU.* #What would I _suggest_? - If a system takes one person 15 minutes to RI, one defender should only need to spend 15 minutes to return it to a safe state. *There should be no reason that it should be more difficult/time consuming for a space owner to invest in saving his space than someone attacking it, unless you want to exact an initial penalty for even owning space to begin with.* - If a system is returned to a safe state during its vulnerability window, it should remain safe until the next vulnerability window. *Im honestly not sure if it does or does not do this, however, if someone just invested the time and effort to save that system, it should be a reward that the space is safe until the next window.* - Remove the Entosis Cycle penalty for larger ships. *Lets get back into the game of encouraging conflict and escalation. We no longer have the single, large HP structures which nearly required deployment of huge numbers of ships and large assets, but that doesnt mean we want to discourage the use of those assets and lower the chance of those larger, unscheduled fights. Flash-fights are what makes this game great.* - Add a cycle time penalty for Entosis Cycle times based upon mass or capacitor capacity. The smaller the ship, the slower the cycle. *This just makes sense, assaulting space should mean an attacker must invest larger, less mobile ships if they want the job done faster. This effectively means that an attacker has to make a real choice between cheap assets that take a long time to complete the job, or bigger, less maneuverable, and more expensive assets to make the job go quicker which gives a higher chance of an actual fight.* - Allow the ability for friendly units to give aid to the entosising ship while not allowing propulsion mod activation whilst entosising. *Lets, again, go back to an entity asserting military dominance on a grid to either reinforce or defend their space and move further away from encouraging the avoidance of fights. Let starting a siege be not only an opportunity for future fights for the system, but flashpoints for for fights now.* - An owner should only be able to designate a single constellation capital, not one capital in every constellation. Additionally, the constellation capital should not reward a base ADM, rather give a bonus to the indices generation for that entire constellation. *On the first part, it doesnt make much sense to allow a single entity to designate multiple capitals. A capital is you home base, the last bastion of your defense. On the second part, giving a bonus to the indices generation to the entire capital constellation reinforces the idea of the Alamo for an alliance. An area of their holdings which are more resistant to the advances of an attacker, where assets will be safer and given more time to be evacuated. It also enforces the idea that this is an activity based system, not a system which allows you to boost one system of each constellation by a simple selection.* ##Ideas I havent fully fleshed out - Allow a space owner to use the entosis module on their own structures, building up a time buffer that attackers have to burn through. The generation of this buffer could be at ~25% of normal rate but still allow someone to **actively** protect/shield their sov. This could only be done during the vulnerability window. - Reduce the total number of nodes that spawn, maybe by about ~30% to create more opportunities for combat and less opportunities for avoidance of combat. *They dont necessarily need to take longer to destroy, but less of them would increase the chance that two fleets might actually meet up with one another for a fight/skirmish.*"

164,vulnerability,Eve,Why is the unanchoring process for Citadel so bad? An alternative.,15,4m0kzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4m0kzl/why_is_the_unanchoring_process_for_citadel_so_bad/,2016-06-01 20:29:26,"**Edit:** Forgot to mention the worst part. When a citadel is unanchoring, you cannot see the unanchoring timer. Instead, the vulnerability timer is visible, which is more than a little misleading. The process for unanchoring a citadel takes 7 days. A full week. It experiences its normal vulnerability windows during this time, and any damage receieved resets the unanchoring process. At the end of the unanchoring, the citadel enters a vulnerability timer for an hour, during which it can be completely destroyed. The idea behind this is to prevent people from avoiding HS war decs and vulnerability timers in general by simply unanchoring their citadel whenever it could be in danger, and reanchoring when it is safe again. Makes sense, alright. But why the fuck did CCP choose 7 days? Why not just make the unanchoring time 24/36/48 hours plus 1/2/3 hours of vulnerability for med/large/xlarge, during which your citadel can be completely destroyed. No one is gonna trade a shorter but completely vulnerable timer once per week for 3 timers over at least 3 days, and you still can't avoid war decs, since the minimum time is 25 hours. CCP, I get it, many of us are no lifers who are on all the time. But the amount of time a group has to devote to managing and protecting citadels right now is REALLY high."
165,vulnerability,Eve,[Propaganda] OSS build first publically available keepstar using Upwell plans.,12,4mtks7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4mtks7/propaganda_oss_build_first_publically_available/,2016-06-07 01:43:24,"GIH-ZG, TRIBUTE Questions have been raised over the security and safety of Upwell Consortium's increasingly popular Citadels. Since their launch at the end of April, capsuleers have flocked to purchase the first wave of Citadels, eager to mark out their own corner of space. Today however, news reaches us from The OSS' Research Labs in Tribute that all is not as it seems. As readers may recall, The OSS took part in targeted raids upon the prototype Citadel which was deployed in the region of Syndicate, alongside members of the Serpentis Corporation. While the catalyst for these raids was retaliation against the domineering manner that Upwell had conducted itself in the region, they also proved a valuable source of information on the Citadel projects. This provided The OSS with a head-start when constructing the first Astrahus class citadel in null-security space. The information gathered has also led to the revelation that all Citadels built to the specifications provided by Upwell contain a strategically placed backdoor, allowing for future attempts at market manipulation and/or siphoning of trade fees to occur. The OSS has constructed and put on contracts a Keepstar class Citadel without the aforementioned vulnerability for capusuleers to purchase and independently verify. Anyone wishing to purchase any more of these patched keepstars should contact **Joo Claw** or **shutupandshave** for more information."

I think I read somewhere the repair timer only pauses if you are doing at leaast 10% of the dps cap? Is that true? i.e. the attackers need to be doing at least 6,000 dps (is the cap still 60k dps for an XL?) to pause the repair timer? No, I'm not planning on building one, and no, I'm not planning on blowing one up. I'm just genuinely curious."
167,vulnerability,Eve,CARE4KIDS - Official Citadel Announcement,32,4nnh0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4nnh0a/care4kids_official_citadel_announcement/,2016-06-12 08:01:08,"#CARE4KIDS  KEEPSTAR CITADEL  TITANS RUs (Still not decided a name, but I like this play on ToysRUs) Location: MAILA 0.4 Sec Space #BACKGROUND: Care For Kids is a charity that was setup by C4W3 who is in Pandemic Legion - RKK. - The Charity was setup after C4W3 was spending allot of his time on dialysis and discovered that some of the kids had been playing EVE. This got his old man cogs working and at that moment the idea of spreading some EVE Online Joy. - He started small by funding a few Kids and got them into playing the game, but as interest grew he knew this was not going to be sustainable by himself. Pandemic Legion Bros stepped up and helped where they could with donations, but it just kept growing to the point it was no longer sustainable. - The public announcement of Care For Kids for external help then came to the Eve Community. This being the Number #1 best Community on the internet (which I hope you all agree) really started to help make the difference. I myself (IronBank) since the public announcement, have been donating a large amount of Plexs (150  200) per month, but have always asked C4W3 to keep this on the DL, as I did this for myself and not for the public interwebs Kudos. - Care for kids currently supports almost 280 Kids in Hospitals across several countries (Sweden / UK / Germany / Australia etc) Approx 75 Kids are now self sufficient and Plex their own accounts. Many have gone on to Join other Alliances in the game or enjoying the nomadic lifestyle in HighSec. This for everyone involved is extremely gratifying, and something that we are truly proud of. - Care For Kids also and does accept RL donations to pay for the Care Packages that C4 and his Family make. These care packages cost / contain: -  Travel costs  Eve media (Mini Leaflet)  Candy (Om nom nom)  Postage &amp; packaging Charges  1 x Plex  +3 implant Set  200 Million Isk  Newbro Ships (tailored to the kids playstyle)  Time! (The most important) - Care For Kids is also recognized in several other countries as stated above. Just to clear up a question that has been asked, yes it is not publicly displayed on the Care For Kids website as it contains C4W3s personal information relating to it, however CCP and some other partner organisations &amp; hospitals have all seen these documents. Yes this was a little silly of C4W3 but I assure you this is all above board and legit. If you do not believe it to be so, then dont and move along. I am sure you will not lose any sleep over it. But can I ask that you stop trying to be the Internet Charity Police as it only comes across as petty and small minded. - Lastly  Care for Kids is not affiliated with anyone. Care For Kids is its own entity and members who help run it are from a range of alliances. A collaboration of amazing people working towards a common good goal, yes we have contacts that we can call upon for help guidance, but no external faction benefit from C4Ks. If Care for Kids ever fell for whatever reason, all isk assets would go to CCP Charity at the time In the form of Plexs etc. - #THE PLAN: Prior to Fanfest me and C4W3 sat down and discussed how we could make Care For Kids self sufficient, and with all the announcements of Citadels being deployed in High Sec to compete with the Trade hubs, we concluded that we needed to be different and have our own unique plan. Between us we have bought many supers and always having to get a 3rd party involved to make the transaction. Then came the logistics of getting all the mods required needed from Jita just added to the difficulty and time consumption of having your new big shiny Toy. - The idea was born to create a neutral ground for EVERYONE in New Eden to be able to dock safely and make their trades. - However with the changes to Jump ranges having just one Keepstar in Maila just will not be enough! Travelling or moving your super will just be a nightmare for any pilot wanting to sell or buy, and each jump adds to that danger! We have given this much thought and decided that we will deploy another 5 Keepstars around the ring of High Sec supporting the most coverage we can. - #DEPLOYING THE CITADEL: The deployment of the Citadel was kept very quiet and only a few knew that this was taking place. Our connections to Pandemic Legion meant we could call upon allies to help move the Citadel through High sec, and finally into Maila 0.4 space. We would like to thank them for taking the time out for this and forever grateful. - I saw a reddit post after the Citadel had gone up and the reaction of only a few was negative on the basis that we had not announced our actions prior to the event. My question to these people would be, would you announce you were moving the value of 10 Outposts to the whole of Eve and its destination? So yes we kept it on the DL and no I do not regret this decision we made. but we did release this was going to happen at FanFest which CCP broadcasted on Twitch. - Finally we deployed the Citadel just before DT &amp; We asked on friends to help come protect the Citadel during the vulnerability window. I would like to thank PL, NC, MC, PH, TEST (if I have missed anyone I am sorry) - #CURRENT AND FUTURE FINANCIALS:  1 x Keepstar donated by Lenny Kravitz &amp; was constructed by Suas &lt;&lt; Thank you so much guys for helping Care For Kids start this amazing Journey.  Keepstar Mods  Donated by IronBank  100 Billion Isk Injection - Donated by IronBank to Seed the capital Market  5 x Keepstars  IronBank over the next 3-5 months. - There will be a small Tax on market transactions @ 1% I believe and do not see this changing. - This isk that Care For Kids generates from the Citadels STAYS IN CARE FOR KIDS AND ONLY USED FOR SUPPORTING THE KIDS. NO isk will be given to anyone running or supporting the charity and we are 100% proud of this standpoint. Unlike RL charities that pay salarys to staff, and as Eve mimics real economy and businesss (well kinda), we will not be adopting this practice. - Anything donated to Care For Kids is a donation, nothing is given back in return, except our Thanks and Love!!! - #3rd Party Dead? This was never the intention but I do agree it does or will over time make them redundant to a point. There will still be sales that take place in Null sec or between Corp / Alliance bros in POSs (while they are still a thing), so yes 3rd Partys will still be needed for the long foreseeable future and of course until CCP make contracts a thing in Citadels. - I would just like to say personally from me to those who have stressed a massive dislike for this Charity idea. Grow up, we have kids who behave better than you and I welcome you should join Care For Kids. You may learn something from these wonderful humble little podlings who have a very different view on life. You not only leave me dumbfounded, but I find you utterly disgusting people. - Myself and C4 will be happy to answer any questions you may have, and thank you for taking the time to read this and supporting this great adventure we have embarked on. - #TLDR : We put a big shiny thing in space for everyone to use. - EDIT1 : Donations can be made in game to M1sty / Septu - EDIT2 : If you really want to know the Charity information, to save openly doxxing himself, why not just PM him directly and ask instead of shitting on what is truly a great thing. You should be ashamed of yourselves. - EDIT3 : The Care for Kids Go fund me has reached a staggering 150 Euros in 2 months (link can be found on the C4K website) by 6 people. Watch out were going to scam all of you and become mega rich scummers... In over 12 years of playing this game I have never felt deeply truly gutted by our community :( - EDIT4 : URL - C4W3: &gt;When this idea were born and we talked to CCP all the registration forms were sent there incl the leagal document were signed between myself and CCP this later was actually posted here on reddit by my misstake resulting in actually doxxing myself and my wife since in Sweden your social security number are connected to it.

168,vulnerability,Eve,An Idea about the new moon mining Structures,2,4nnrsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4nnrsf/an_idea_about_the_new_moon_mining_structures/,2016-06-12 09:18:16,"I know we have the POS siphon units but there are various reasons why they are sub optimal and seldom used. Like all new structures I have no doubts that mining outposts will get vulnerability timers to be destroyed/conquered whatever. I propose they have a smaller timer within that timer when they can be hacked using the data analyzer and playing a beefed up version of the existing hacking mini game. Unlike the current version where iirc you have three chances before your loot blows up, against a mining outpost you only get one shot. Success and you can loot up to 50% of whatever moongoo has been gathered by the colony, and no one ever knows you were there. Failure however is where it gets interesting. Should you fail the hack the mining colony defends itself by applying the what i call the Venus Fly Trap, a hic scram and a 99% web effect on the offending ship, or maybe even the entire grid if that's not too OP, that lasts for 10 minutes. It also sends the owning Corp a mail allowing them to investigate and blap the hapless thief, if they can form in 10 minutes. And if the thief has friends well then PVP happens. Im also not adverse to the trap generating a cyno beacon as well. The system encourages occupancy because repeated failures to respond to hacking attempts on your mining outpost will seriously dent if not eliminate your profits. if you dont show up to protect against hackers nothing will stop them from continuing to hack you until successful. To compensate that though the hacking needs to be hard as balls, brute hacking a unbonused frigate with a cloaky hauler alt should have a minuscule success rate. I could also see the hacking difficulty being tied to ADMS so systems with low ADMS could be easily brute hacked and systems with MAX ADMS would be very difficult even on a bonused hull with perfect skills. Since these things will exist in lowsec you could make the lowsec difficulty modifier about half of what a maxed out ADM system would be. The end goal of this idea and others like it is to lower the bar of becoming a content creator, and content creation in general. with a covert cyno a cloaky hauler, a hacking toon,and bridging blops, you could conceivably make off with hundreds of millions of isk in moongoo or potentially get one or all of those ships caught and brutally executed under a 99% web/hic point.

169,vulnerability,Eve,CCP whatever you do don't mess up fighting over moons,0,4nvzhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4nvzhg/ccp_whatever_you_do_dont_mess_up_fighting_over/,2016-06-14 00:56:19,It seems that fighting over minable moons seems to be one of the last good content generating activities in the game. With the new mining platforms and their 'engaging' timers I fear that CCP is going to destroy one of the few major conflict drivers. Whoever thought a DPS cap and limited vulnerability/multiple rfs on a citadel should be thrown in a gorilla pit with no zoo keeper on duty. Seriously how does that make it out of a boardroom. Fighting over alliance incomes is one of the only ways where somebody has something worth fighting over because both the defender wants to maintain their gold and the attacker has something to gain
170,vulnerability,Eve,Eviction Notice Served - The Culture's after campaign report,31,4okn8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4okn8r/eviction_notice_served_the_cultures_after/,2016-06-18 04:29:15,"[EVICTION NOTICE](URL Comrades Hello, Today marks the end of The-Culture's campaign to conquer territory within the Fountain region of New Eden. The constellations of Chimera and Unicorn are some of the richest in Fountain and had been the homes of Violence of Action[VIOL8] and Cede Nullis[-CN-], calling themselves collectively 'The Republic of Space Texas'. Chimera and Unicorn were taken by Viol8 and CN, from assorted F-Core, independents and the ex BL. renter alliance, at the end of January this year. The-Culture looked on, as this space was conquered and settled, without taking any direct action to hinder or help the parties involved. [MAP THEN](URL The-Culture held the majority of the R64 moons within these constellations. These moons were defended successfully on each occasion that towers were timed correctly. The Republic of Space Texas threw down their new Bhaalgorn fleet for one such tower fight. This resulted in a victory for The-Culture. [BHAALGONE BATTLEREPORT](URL [VIDEO](URL Some Thuliums and Neos were lost to Viol8 &amp; CN in the following weeks. One Dyspro was lost thanks to the extended downtime that lasted for 7 hours or so. Stability then prevailed, status quo was established and WWB kicked off. Various deals relating to; AFK camping, blops dropping ratters, NIPs for moons and sov, were made, enabling everyone to go kick that bee guy. Some of these deals may have been broken by a guy blops'ing an ishtar or a guy in a svipul entosis'ing a 1 adm system. TC were guilty of these things without doubt, in the new sov system line members can start shit without leadership having direct control over them. Shit happened, Jimmies were rustled. Fast forward to WWBs eventual cooling down and Viol8 and CN deploy home from Pure Blind. The-Culture secret agents then acquire a recording of Viol8's directors meeting discussing their plans to take the remaining moons within their territory. Orders were given to syphon and RF all TC moons repeatedly and at every opportunity, cloaky camping and blops dropping TC ratters were also encouraged. *Guys basically its open season on all TC assets, TC are fun to shoot.* - Viol8 Leadership person April 2016. With this knowledge TC leadership and FC's decide that a message needs to be sent. This message will be written with lasers, rail-guns and projectile turrets. The initial TC plan was to take back lost moons within viol8 and CN space and of course defend any reinforced towers still held. Blops dropping and 'afk' covert campers were deployed first to CN's pocket of Unicorn constellation, Sun Tzu was consulted and a 'divide and conquer' strategy adopted. Because Viol8 and CN were strong in USTZ and had set all their vulnerability timers accordingly, and TC being mainly EUTZ, psychological warfare was the only method seen as viable to bring them to the negotiation table. TC had no desires to take or hold the sov, we only wanted to keep our towers un-molested. TC naively thought we could force a deal in which all parties leave each other alone and TC keeps its R64s. This deal was, understandably, never going to be acceptable for Viol8 and CN. Fights over towers continued, gradually TC gained the upper hand with every tower saved. Space Texas, attempting to break this trend, started using extremely long range tornados to alpha strike T3s and trade very favourably. TC soon countered with armour Machariels, which could match the nado range, and camp the 6VDT-H undock preventing the tornados from ever getting loose. [TORNADON'T DO THIS TO ME](URL [VIDEO](URL On the 27th of April the citadel expansion was launched. TC started to apply more pressure to CN. Higher Than Everest and a few small gang pvpers from some other Culture corps started living deep behind enemy lines using skirmish warfare basing out of one of the R64 control towers in L-1SW8. TC also anchored a small citadel in B17O-R, this citadel being deployed in enemy sov, had a 6 day anchoring period. The stage was set for a long over due clash between, what turned out to be, Viol8 CN and almost all the other alliances TC had fought with since its creation in September of 2015. The Citadel was named Sydney which burned in a fire as bright as the sun. The Republic of Space Texas undoubtedly won this objective killing the Astrahus, but at great cost. The fight took place on the in gate from IGE-RE, TC jumped into the assembled fleets. Apostles were used to keep the proteus' alive. One Apostle was unable to tank until he came out of triage, and paid the iron price. From then on the blood flowed from the viol8 side, much valiant effort and heart was thrown into the brawl with reshipping from the home team mounting to the losses rather than swaying the fight. Meanwhile a small band of confessors spent the 24 minutes killing the doomed Astrahus. [RIP SYDNEY BATTLREPORT](URL [VIDEO](URL The-Culture promptly anchored another Citadel, everyone wanted to go again. In another region on the other side of TC's territory one time MBC allies TISHU were roaming in the newly buffed carriers and got themselves tackled by Suddenly Spaceships. What followed has been well covered by Reddit so I won't go into it too much, but what sprung from this fight was the great INIT ruse cruise of our time. CN believed INIT were being set blue to TC and were to move into, and occupy, Chimera and Unicorn. This was a truly epic ruse, mostly because, I believe, it was the straw that broke CN's back. They sounded the retreat and started looking for the exit door. The Republic of Space Texas was essentially reduce to one member, Viol8. TC's behind enemy lines unit moved themselves from the L-1SW8 POS into the new citadel, that anchored with only token resistance, in B17O-R. The focus of all cloaky camping and blops dropping turned firmly onto Viol8 in Chimera, Unicorn was left to be evacuated in peace. At this point TC leadership realized that sov conquest and eviction were the only way forward for the campaign, nobody was going to swallow a deal in which we own all the good moons and they fester in secluded ratting space. The culture deployed to APM-6K, in direct range of almost all the contested moons and sov. Small gang warfare became the norm for a week or so of hard EUTZ domination in Chimera. Nothing moved without becoming another killmark on a TC 'kitey faggot' Orthrus, Cerb or Nightmare. Viol8 decided to anchor a Fortizar in their system of 7BX-6F, whether this was a leadership decision or a rich member's personal choice, is not known by myself or anyone else from TC. What we did know was that we wanted to kill it with fire. TC knew if we let it get online we may never get a desirable conclusion to our campaign. Wisely the Fortizar was timed for deep USTZ away from TC's dominant timezone. Alarm clocks were set, batphones were rung and friends invited. The stage was set for another great clash. [FORTIZARS AND BATPHONES](URL [PHOTO ALBUM](URL CN were gone and with no batphones available to viol8, the prospects did not look good for them. Valiantly Viol8 made a stand, they anchored bubbles all around the constellation and cyno jammed almost every system. TC recon noticed XJP-Y7 was not jammed and so bridged in using the gates through AV-VB6. Things were close, The Fortizar had only a few minutes left of its repairing cycle, TC got four dreads on the fortizar catching it with only 40 seconds remaining. Three TC dreads were left bubbled on the in gate, time was as tight as Taylor Swift's buns. These dreads got free and were sent directly to the cyno jammer and started to bring it down and open the system for TC's batphone. Tishu had snuck into Fountain and were in range with their super and titan force. TC promised Tishu they would let them get on the fortizar kill, but held them back in the hope Viol8 would use some of their supers or titans to attack the vulnerable dreads. In the end Viol8 put away their Tornados, that had been out classed by the Machariel hulls, and came with an assortment of left over Bhaalgorns, Zealots and a hand full of dreads. When Viol8 jumped into 7BX-6F, with their new fleet including the dreads, a TC cyno was opened and the hammer dropped. This period was followed by every small POS, owned and used by viol8 members for ratting and mining, getting reinforced and killed by a few wild Nyx pilots and their new tech 2 fighter bombers, now able to hit small to medium POS's. With CN gone numbers were becoming manageable for TC's USTZ and some skirmishes were fought with blood being shed on both sides. Viol8's timidity to use their capitals, and TC's opposite yolo attitude with theirs, often made TC come out on top when otherwise they should have lost. TC's EU dominance was continually used to maximum Psychological effect, tactics like reinforcing all services on all stations, large bubbles anchored on all undock points and Boosh destroyers cloaked ready for an aggressors trying to clear their station or fix their services. All these methods were employed by TC. Everything culminated in the eventual reinforcement of 6VDT-H station, A station famous for hosting some of EVE's great last stands. Alas the last stand of 6VDT-H this time was a pale example of Aegis sov warfare. The stations name was the Space Alamo, quite befitting The Republic of Space Texas Coalition, and its defence involved three relatively small confessor fleets. These fleets split up amongst the constellation with the aim of killing TC's entosis ships and relying on node regen and entosis vexors to win the objective and ultimately secure 6VDT-H. TC split its FOTM armour Machariel fleet into three smaller wings and followed their counterpart confessor gangs around Chimera. First the TCU was killed, removing capital status. Then the I-Hub, removing the ADM bonus. TC then went home vowing to RF the station again, with its new 1.0x ADM, the following night. Viol8 and CN took the space with purely Confessor/Deacon fleets and lost it all in those same Confessor fleets. With their capital crumbling, its ADM slashed, the writing was on the wall and the evacuation order was given. Thus ending the eviction of The Republic of Space Texas, and also ending my wall of text. I hope good fights were enjoyed by all, and that wherever anyone ends up they find their new Space Texas in the stars. Sorry we Accidently'ed your space.

171,vulnerability,Eve,"Citadels and Wormholes - Searching for special advice, pro tipps and things someone should know.",6,4otk7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4otk7x/citadels_and_wormholes_searching_for_special/,2016-06-20 00:42:51,"Hey fellow capsuleers i have finally come here to ask some advanced questions about citadels, especially in WH-Space. It is my first post on reddit. The following will be quite a chunk of text. But i think it is needed because the questions are a bit more differentiated and therefore additional information about my situation is required. So here we go. In the past my corp lived in a C2 WH and we have experience with POSes in WH, but we know only the basics about citadels (for example like in this guide i have found: URL ). Also my CEO has concerns about citadels, because he thinks their development is still in progress and therefore we should wait till CCP is done. So i am searching for advice, pro tipps and hidden knowledge, but also for thoughts and opinions on this matter. First of all some intel about us. We are just 3 guys, maybe up to 6, when some members get active again. Our prime time is central europe in the evening. All members have some experience with life in wh-space and pvp in gerenal. And our CEO is very experienced in POS design. If we go back into a WH, we probably aim for a C2 again. Let me come to the important part now. 1. We are kinda struggeling with the choice of size for our citadel. Given the small size of our corp we don't know if an Astrahus is enough to fit our needs or if a Fortizar is too much to handle. Industrial capabilities vs. defencive capabilities? Does a Fortizar even fit into a C2? 2. Setting the vulnerability windows for a citadel. Our CEO was thinking about setting the vulnerability windows around the server downtime, which recently got shortened to 15 min per day. The argument in favor of this idea is that most players are inactive around this time. The argument against this is no member is online during that time either, mainly because of RL. Setting the vulnerability window to our own prime time, means the members are more likely to be online but for the possible enemies goes the same. Do you sirs and ladies have any further thoughts on this? 3. Are there any hidden facts, bugs, glitches, exploits, etc. regarding citadels that could harm us and should be known? Several searches on the internet led mainly to some basic guides and overviews. We just want to avoid some bad surprices. 4. What are your opinions and thoughts regarding the concerns on further development of citadels? Are there too many or big changes to the basic system still coming and is it better to wait? Are there no more big changes to fear and one can start with citadels without any regreds in the near future? (I know this might be the hardest question, therefore i am looking for thoughts and opinions and less for clear answers and facts.) Thank you very much for your attention and contributions in advance."

While some functionality that pilots use will still fall within the exclusive range of the legacy POS structures (for now), several features of these new superstructures stand-out as potential game changers right out of the box. - Affordability: While large (and certainly XL) class citadels will remain outside the reach of solo pilots and small corporations, the medium class citadels provide a basic ""base-in-a-box"" right out of the gate that do not necessarily require sovereignty or 24/7 monitoring due to constant vulnerability. It will be great for the new pilots and the proverbial ""little guy"" in New Eden. - Access: Being able to use access control lists for your Citadel not only serves as a much needed improvement over legacy POS management, but also allows for greater distribution of public facilities (i.e. freeports) in underused areas like wormholes and NPC null space that are frankly dead as a door nail right now. That being said, evolution of the new structure system as a whole will have to play out over the next year. For the sake of this discussion though, what areas and regions of New Eden do you think could potentially benefit most from Citadels. Full Disclosure: I may or may not be using this feedback to determine where to put a freeport Citadel as my gift to myself and the community. My RL birthday is 4/27. Will it get wrecked?

I think it would be cool, and good for the game, if the highest amount of people were encouraged to participate in sov events. It seems like kind of a silly system when the optimal strategy to defend against an overwhelming group is with something other than getting as many people as you can to occupy your space during the window. I'm not going to give a list of ideas on how to fix it because I am not a game developer, but it would be cool if this strategy wasn't a good strategy. It's probably not an easy fix because there are groups that need a specific window to defend, and any auto generated activity monitor is going to probably end up not working well."

The 15-minute vulnerability window after anchoring has proven to be a ""content magnet"" of incredible proportion in both K-space and J-space, and only HRDX has managed to pull it off so far (with a year of planning, incredible paranoia, and 1T+ ISK). Fortizars are already enormous targets, and one can only imagine that all of the major PVP groups would pull out all the stops for what would amount to a ~5 Titan killmail. This is exacerbated by the fact that everyone in EVE would have roughly 24 hours' notice to form. Do anchoring mechanics need to be changed to allow the anchoring of these things to be reasonably feasible in k-space?"
187,vulnerability,Eve,Skynet 2.0,5,4k88sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/4k88sa/skynet_20/,2016-05-20 23:31:55,"As many will recall during the Scylla release CCP moved to counter a feature known as ""Skynetting"" To quote the forum post &gt;This thread is for discussing the proposed removal of fighter assist for carriers and super carriers. &gt;This change being largely driven by 'skynetting' which is a tactic where carriers and super carriers can sit in near perfect safety at the edge of starbase shields and assign thousands of DPS worth of fighter drones to their fleet mates who can fly whatever ship they want *) , while wielding an enormous amount of damage. We feel this is not meeting our standards for risk vs reward and therefor would like to remove the ability to assist fighters. More details are covered in this dev blog. Of course Citadel brought a complete change to fighter mechanics on top of the scylla changes, so Skynetting as it was previously known no longer exists. What we now have are Carriers with ludicrous lock ranges, gigantic grids and fighters that can be used from thousands of KM's away. Theoretically this could offer interesting gameplay with carriers engaging each other across huge distances. The problem comes in when you bring in Citadels. Citadels brought in the ability to tether which is a pretty cool feature. As a pseudo force field replacement the tether makes you invulnerable and will repair damage as long as you do not meet these conditions: * active weapons timer * having or starting a target lock on another target * lack of docking rights with the structure * ejecting from the ship * ship is warp scrambled * activating a cynosural field generator Citadels need to be 1000km from another structure and 500km from a celestial. With the new grid sizes this of course means that they can be on grid with gates or stations. With the new fighter and carrier mechanics this makes it possible for carriers to sit on a citadel and control fighters on the undock of a gate or station. They can either warp to the gate or station and drop fighters then warp back to the citadel or simply deploy fighters from the citadel and let them slow boat. If they start getting attacked they can simply break lock, wait out the weapons timer and once that has cleared the citadel will re-tether the carrier. Someone locking the carrier will not prevent it from tethering, only a scram can do this. If the citadel is being gunned of course that becomes more difficult. There's also nothing stopping, say a friendly FAX from sitting on station as well. Currently there is a PL Fortizar anchoring off the Saranen undock. Given that the tactic du jour has been camping the undock with carriers already and playing station games, it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going to happen once that Fortizar goes online. Of course you can not truly be camped in a low sec station, since there's no bubbles, you can always instawarp off. However I think this will be an interesting test case to see where Citadels and the carrier mechanics need iteration. Today it is just us dirty goons who will suffer the wrath here, tomorrow it could be anyone across new eden. Yes we could try and form up to kill this citadel during the 15 min vulnerability, maybe we will I have no idea. However we also know that there's a good chance of a large portion of the MBC coming out to defend it. Regardless Saranen is just one example. I know the removal of skynet to begin with was controversial to a lot of people, well here we see essentially a very similar problem, the ability to sit in near perfect safety while wielding an enormous amount of damage. Is this something people see as a good thing going forward? Is this simply ""emergent gameplay""? "

Dates for updates will be in GMT+10 because converting to UTC is not fun.* --- --- --- The political structure of Eve before the war was Imperium , a super-coalition of 40,000 members+ having total dominance in the north of the map, in an area called null sec (or 0.0 space, it's lawless and can be player owned). The hallmark of Imperium is enormous numbers of people in generally cheap, but easy to build and replace doctrines (doctrine being a set of ships and tactics) to outnumber an enemy. They were considered to be totally unassailable, possessing manpower and resources far beyond even the most powerful of entities in Eve. The core of the Imperium (which was rebranded from the Cluster Fuck Coalition to increase marketability in other games for their media empire) is Goonswarm, run by The Mittani who has over all control over the Coalition. The Imperium as a coalition is made up of multiple alliances, including Goons, FCON, Razor, SMA, Co2, Bastion and a few others, and this large group of players is one of the ways they derive their enormous power. Imperium , the big group up north, have been stagnating because no one wants to fight them (they're known for making fights not fun, by intentionally lagging servers, avoiding fights and when they do fight, bringing so many people they can't possibly lose). To counter-act this, they initiated the ""Viceroy"" program which would see all their neighbours pay them tribute to keep their space. As part of this, they invaded Cloud Ring (Pandemic Horde's region at the time), but were disappointed when PH immediately left, denying any content to the Imperium. Instead, the Imperium were left with weeks of grinding out control of the region, which is both boring and tedious, unaided by the fact many groups found it entertaining to take casual ""roams"" out to interfere with their fleets trying to take control of the systems. Low Sec (0.1 - 0.4 space) is another area of space, and has some laws (not many though). The LowSec entities (known collectively as LSV) are constantly fighting over ""moons"" (a way of passively generating income for a player group), and their hallmark is obscenely expensive and skill intensive doctrines, to make up for comparatively very small numbers of players. After invading Cloud Ring failed to gain Imperium content (or tribute, as the inhabitants just left), they decided to declare war on the next region across which happened to be the Low Sec home of the LSV alliances. The idea was that LSV had lived in the area for years, and relied on their ""moons"" (a way of generating passive income) which the Imperium planned to take in order to force LSV to fight. This didn't work very well. Instead of steamrolling the LSV groups with minimal preparation and effort, as everyone (including LSV themselves) expected, they got crushed in pretty much every engagement. By this I mean they'd lose full fleets and kill only one or two ships in return. Gradually they got a little better, but they almost never did ""well,"" almost always losing, and continued to be demolished by fleets that at times were a quarter their size or less. This was vastly different from what was expected - the expectation was that LSV would refuse to pay tribute, would harass the Imperium as they inevitably lost all of their moons and would simply take them back uncontested when the Imperium eventually left. This is because you can't actually take stations and control over systems away like you can in null sec, so it's impossible to drive out a group who are determined to stay, especially groups such as LSV who have their traditional homes in the area. To counter-act these losses, they prepared better and got more numbers. In response, the LSV entities put aside their constant squabbling and war mongering to band together into a loose Coalition, and what is affectionately known as ""Forming Voltron"" (thus the name Low Sec Voltron  LSV). LowSec Alliances might constantly fight and war with their rivals, but they all hate one thing above all others, and thats outsiders demanding fealty and tribute. The same thing happened again, with Imperium losing fights, but on a much larger scale with fights involving thousands of pilots. After not only defending all their own moons, the LowSec entities proceeded to drive Imperium back out of LowSec, taking all their valuable moons, which had previously been left untouched in an effort to avoid provoking the much larger coalition. While this was happening, one of the larger Alliances in the Imperium (who are a coalition of alliances) angered a group called I Want Isk (IWI), an enormously rich and powerful gambling banker organisation. The reports indicated accusations about theft and betrayal of one of the leaders of a Imperium Alliance. As a result, IWI decided to pay the LSV groups, among (potentially) others, to continue fighting the Imperium after taking their revenge in Low Sec. Having successfully expelled Imperium from Low Sec, LSV looked for future targets, and with likely direction from the IWI (gambler guys) and Tishu's extensive BLOPs (battleships with a very long range jump drive to attack farming ships) campaign in the Imperium Fade Region, set their sights on the north. With the assistance of virtually every major entity in Eve, who answered the call to arms from either being paid by IWI or the glory of the next major war, began a full scale invasion of the Imperium's home territory of the Northern Null Sec Regions. This new coalition became known as the Money Badger Coalition (MBC), a play on the name of the group of alliances who fought (and lost) against the Imperium in the last major war (**H**oney Badger Coalition), many of whom also joined with LSV in their renewed fight against the Imperium. Spread across numerous regions and hundreds of systems, MBC have begun to systematically drive out Imperium from their homes. Currently most of the alliances in the Imperium are in full retreat, after having lost several regions that were previously thought to be impregnable. As it currently stands, a large portion of the Imperium have been ordered to withdraw to the far north by Imperium leadership, the home of Goonswarm (known usually as ""Goons""), the leaders and core of the Imperium. A recent address by the leader of the Imperium indicates they intend to use the north as a base to harass the allies as they grind the regions in order to control them totally. As the allies begin to take control of the regions which are increasingly being left undefended, the last few pockets of resistance such as the Co2 Alliance are gradually being worn down. It is assumed that at some point the allies will move further north, once their latest conquests are secure, to take the fight to Goons. If this happens, you can be almost certain that we will see another battle such as that of B-R5RB several years ago (you can look that up, Imperium won that battle and war), which resulted in hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of assets being lost. In other words, its the war of a century in Eve, with pretty much the entirety of the PvP groups in the game all allied against a single super-coalition. Regardless of who wins, it's going to be a really cool time to be in the game. --- **Update 1: The First Major Victory for MBC** As of a few hours ago, the Money Badger Coalition won a major strategic victory, successfully taking control of Co2's (a member of the Imperium) primary staging system. This is significant because it was defended by a number of Imperium fleets, lacking only their capital fleet due to their misplaced suspicions of a trap. This was the first major test for MBC, to see if they could stand up to the force of a full Imperium formup. The timer (or objective) was won, whilst inflicting enormous losses from the Imperium's subcapital forces, with several fleets being wiped out to a man. Of particular note was Vily's (a Imperium fleet commander who defected to TEST Alliance before the war began) bombing run against a FCON Battlecruiser fleet, which wiped out every ship in it instantly before they even got to the fight. Importantly, M-O is traditionally the bottleneck for accessing the regions of the Northern Empires of the past, as it allows access for the allies into the northern regions (where the core of Imperium live). Following the victory, Co2 have declared they are no longer a signatory of the Imperium, resetting their ""blue standings"" (or their official signal of allegiance) within thirty minutes of the announcement which came whilst the fleets of MBC were still mopping up the last stragglers of the Imperium's force. It is assumed they will now be supporting the Allies, in the hopes of having their space returned to them, however the exact degree of their support and whether they will actively fight their old allies in the Imperium. --- **Update 2: The Imperium Response to the Defeat** So the leader of the Imperium, The Mittani, released their version of events from the M-O fight in a soundcloud recording which you can find [HERE](URL The gist of it is they felt it was at least a partial victory for them, as they were falsely lead to believe that the whole point of the iHub fight was to trap and kill their super capital fleet (neither side fielded their extensive super capital fleets in this conflict). Note the iHub is a structure which grants control of the system (ownership if you will) and allows upgrades of the system, and thus is essential to controlling the system. *Edit for clarity:* The iHub doesn't give specific control, but is one of many structures that allows a group to hold sway over a system in differing ways. Taking the iHub in this situation however gave the Allies enormous leverage over Co2, and takes away all upgrades previously in the system, and puts Co2 in the awkward position of not having full control of their primary staging system. Supercap fleets contain the most powerful ships in Eve, Titans and Super Carriers, neither of which can be docked and must generally always be piloted (thus tying up that pilot whilst the individual owns the ship), resulting in added cost on top of their already enormous build costs (for titans, this number is in the thousands of dollars range). It is worth noting that the iHub timer is considered important because it allows the Allies to control M-O, which is an important stepping stone to the northern regions, where the Imperium has retreated to. Whether they remain ignorant of the system's importance, or merely do not consider it to be important is unclear. Thus you have the two sides of the conflict spinning this massive fight two different ways, with both claiming victory of different objectives. --- **Update 3: Fleet Commander Kicked form the Imperium** So apparently one of the Imperium's SMA FCs has just been kicked after doing an interview, see the post [HERE](URL for links to the pastebin and interview. The interview contained nothing that wasn't widely known (see [THIS](URL post for a full map of the Imperium's Jump Bridge network, a way of getting around space quickly which is apparently ~secret~), so one can draw their own conclusions. The interviewer's comment on the situation can be found [HERE](URL I am currently trying to get in contact with an Imperium diplo to try get their side of this story. EDIT: Got in contact with one and got pointed at Sion, a mail has been sent and I am awaiting a reply. EDIT 2: I have yet to receive a reply from Imperium leadership, so I can only assume there is no more information forth coming and the FC kicked's account is accurate enough that no counter point of view needs to be presented. --- **Update 4: The Interview** Today an interview found [HERE](URL between Vily, the campaign Fleet Commander for TEST Alliance (part of the MBC) and DaBigRedBoat (DBRB), his equivalent in Goons for the Imperium took place, overseen by an Eve developer. Beyond a recap of recent events, and Vily describing the victory condition for MBC as the eradication of the Imperium from their territory, DBRB announced the goal is to avoid fights and simply harass the invaders using interceptors (which is very similar to what Pandemic Horde did to the Imperium in their first attack under the Viceroyalty program). The goal is to quote, ""avoid fights"" and try generally try to not engage with the invaders. Instead, DBRB describes his recent activities instead of defending their space as, quote, ""I've been down south with a bunch of elite pvpers, and we've been going after Pandemic Horde which is a newbie alliance."" This is very similar to what PH's parent group Pandemic *Legion* (PL) did to Brave Newbies early-mid 2015. --- **Update 5: The Next Imperium Ally is Attacked** Several important timers (points at which objectives can be contested) came out today, one of which being the UQ9-3C iHub, which is the staging system of FCON and RAZR, two major CFC Alliances. Despite MBC forming up over 1700 pilots for the fight, Imperium wisely planned ahead, bubbling the gate which the invaders would need to pass through, limiting their tactical options. Once the MBC fleets entered system, they were faced down by several Imperium fleets, as well as cloaked bombers who immediately took a bombing run at the Allies fleets. The fight on the gate was a success in terms of an engagement, however the Imperium kept the MBC fleets tied up long enough to recapture their iHub, saving it. Currently Imperium fleets are not engaging, preferring to avoid a confrontation. The MBC fleets are back in UQ9 for the station timer. The station was ""bubble fucked,"" a term used to describe an object in space which has had bubbles placed all over it to prevent anyone from warping in or out. The Imperium fleets however never undocked, and allowed their station to be captured by the MBC. The rap sheet at the end of the day was: The iHub Timer was won by the Imperium after they managed to keep the MBC fleets tied up on the entrance star gate to the system, thus retaining control of it. The Station Timer was won by MBC, therefore they have taken control of the station from the Imperium. In terms of kills vs lossess, the Imperium lost it marginally, however given the only significant fight lasted less than an hour, this result is fairly irrelevant. Additionally, they saved all of their VFK timers which were never attacked. Overall, one has to assume the MBC will claim victory in this engagement due taking control of the station and everything contained within. --- **Update 6: Imperium Responds to Co2's Defection** Sion, the head diplomat of the Imperium, wrote a timeline of the period leading up to Co2's defection after the Imperium's defeat at M-O. You can find these logs [HERE](URL - be advised, it is thousands of lines long. To summarise it, as far as I can tell (I didn't read the whole thing, and I don't think I can be blamed), Sion is describing why he doesn't like Co2, why they are a bad alliance and why they will fail in Eve. The document includes enormous amounts of chat logs between various Imperium individuals and Co2 leadership as well as his opinions on Co2 'betraying' them. It is worth noting that while Co2 most certainly betrayed the Imperium, it was the only path open to them as it was clear the Imperium would be unable to save them from being evicted by the MBC. The alternative was to simply allow this to happen - this was likely the more honorable path to take, but not one many would have expected them to. --- **Update 7: The War for the Name of the War** *04.04.2016* Given the current war started very slowly, and the MBC coalition (which took long enough to name in its own right) formed gradually and slowly, there was never an official announcement by an alliance about naming the war until very recently. The general consensus amongst the MBC is that the war will be called ""World War Bee,"" named after the logo of the primary target of the war, Goonswarm (it's a bee if you missed that). To explain the name, The Imperium is being targeted mainly for their leadership's behaviour, and other reasons previously stated. Given Goons are the primary member, and the leaders, of the Imperium, this is the reason the Imperium as a whole is under attack. A prime example of this is Co2's defection - once they left the Imperium and pledged themselves to the MBC, they were no longer part of the Imperium and thus not a target. A thread on reddit clearly stating the community's insistence on the name is seen [HERE](URL However, the Imperium is obviously not a fan of this name as it implies the MBC is in control of both the war and casts Goonswarm (and their Imperium Allies) as the enemy. As a result, they have been naming the war on their own, and have recently begun reacting to the consensus on World War Bee which both the community and CCP themselves are now using. [THIS](URL ping was sent by the Mittani on the topic, announcing his intent to rename it in a manner that casts the Imperium in a more favourable light. To explain names they have come up with: ""The Casino War"" refers to IWI's involvement in the war as they are a gambling organisation (the link to casinos being a jab at the MBC being their puppets). ""The Turncoat War"" and the ""War of Traitors"" both refer to Co2's defection from the Imperium to join the MBC, and are taking aim at MBC's willingness to accept Co2 into the fold. The Mittani also makes the point that he feels he has the right to have official input on the naming of the war, as seen in his calling out of CCP for naming it ""World War Bee"" based off of community opinion without consulting him first. --- **Update 8: The Grind Continues, AUTZ's time to shine** *07.04.2016* It's been a few days without a major update, so I figured I'd update with the latest minor happenings. I'll try do these updates in between big ones, and I'll include the latest drama and going-ons around the place with links. The drama over the Mittani's demand to be consulted on naming the war has continued the past few days, with numerous call outs and propaganda pieces being made in response. One notable point in particular is the new name reddit has begun calling the Goonswarm (and the Imperium collectively) - ""those bee guys"" - in an attempt to rile up the Mittani by mocking their logo and group identity. An amusing chrome extension to change all mentions of the ""CFC"" (Imperium) to ""those bee guys"" was posted [HERE](URL CCP has released three new character portrait backgrounds in game, two of which are for each side in the war, which is being announced officially by them as ""World War Bee."" This thereby legitimizes the name as such, contrary to the Mittani's vehement disapproval and demand to be consulted on it. Post here [HERE[(URL The only major piece of new news is the CFC have ordered all their Alliances to set their vulnerability timers to AUTZ. To recap, these timers represent the only time of day during which they can be captured. The assumed goal being to try burn out the much smaller AUTZ, the reuslt has only been a mass increase in objectives attacked as the Imperiun's power is much weaker in AUTZ, and the power ratio swings in MBC's favour during this time. Post on the effects of this [HERE](URL Beyond all that, MBC is slowly taking over the Imperium's territory, gradually moving in towards to capital region of Deklein, commonly known as ""Fortress Dek,"" and the 'ancestral home' of Goonswarm. Expect the war to heat up when this happens. In the meantime, MBC is slowly replacing all of the Imperium's POSes with their own on valuable moons, and killing those producing super carriers and titans (enormously expensive ships which can only be built in POSes in null sec). Current numbers of just Titans destroyed while being built is approaching the number destroyed in the penultimate battle of the last major war, the legendary B-R5RB, where 74 titans were destroyed. This remains to date the largest number of titans killed in a single conflict. As of [THIS](URL post, MBC only need to kill 4 more of these building POSes before they equal that number. Again, expect this number to rise rapidly when the invasion of Deklein begins. --- **Update 9: The Super-Capitals Come Out to Play** *09.04.2016* So a large scale Capital brawl broke out a couple of hours ago in the system of X-7OMU. This system is in null sec, but unlike the player owned space around it, is NPC controlled. This means that all of the usual lawless activities take place, but one group cannot 'own' the system nor control who docks in the stations. Normally this means it isn't worth fighting in these systems due to them not being able to be captured (unless there is a valuable POS). In this case, a TISHU (part of the MBC) Hel (a type of super carrier) was caught in the system by the Imperium. They immediately formed up a fleet to kill it, though it was saved just in time as can be seen in [THIS](URL screenshot. Note the central white and red spherical bars - the internal one (structure, and usually has less HP than the others) when it reaches 0 causes the ship to explode, and you can see it came very close before his allies could repair the outer two bars (Armor and Shields). This battle was importat in this war because it was only the second battle of the war involving capitals, the behemoths of Eve Online. The last one involved MBC dropping entirely uncontested with no opposing capital force. In this case it was Pandemic Legion (PL) with roughly 100 Super Carriers supported by a Rattlesnake battleship fleet, dropping on Imperium forces made up of 11 Naglfar-class Dreadnoughts, 60 Megathron/Apocalypse battleships and a large Cerberus support fleet. Losses were extreme for the Imperium, losing over 50bn worth of ships including all of their capital dreadnoughts, most of their battleship fleet and nearly all of their inderdictors (bubble-throwing ships) and tactical destroyers. In return they killed only 8bn of MBC assets, and thus not a single supercarrier was lost. The full battlereport can be found [HERE](URL as well as pretty pictures of the battle [HERE](URL --- **Update 10: A Director-Level Spy is Uncovered** *09.04.2016 #2* Two updates in one day? Yes, and it's because this is a big one. A [USER](URL on reddit has been consistently leaking information from top level Imperium channels, including intel that the Goonswarm fully intends to let their Imperium Allies die off as a buffer zone to their Deklein homeland as well as intel on various corps leaving and internal drama (e.g. [THIS](URL Today, he was finally discovered as Lemba, the director of DOKDO, a Korean corp in Goonswarm as seen [HERE](URL From the mail he sent to his corp [HERE](URL we can read into his reasoning for this. Apparently his defection from the Imperium stems from an objection to the Imperium's leadership forcing their underlings to to far more work than could be reasonably expected whilst doing next to none themselves. Lemba mentions he had access to a significant amount of assets if he had chosen to steal it all - he uses this to make the point that he didn't because he believes in his corp, just not the Alliance and Coalition's behavior. Apparently he has a number of logs of conversation which he will be posting in short order, so stay tuned as it's almost certainly going to be a drama filled day. --- **Update 11: The Walls Crumble** *12.04.2016* Well, this is gonna be a big one. There's a lot to talk about, and a lot of opinions floating around. I'm going to be mostly linking threads and then explaining how they fit together, and giving an opinion at the need because one act in particular disgusts me to such a degree I refuse not to be biased on the matter. This is a long one, so I'll be spitting it. Generic news in this one, and Ill do another update after this one with the major thing. So, to begin with some interesting news that isn't going to be too long, VFK - the traditional home of Goonswarm and the heart of the Imperium - was taken. This wasn't expected to happen for months, and enormous resistance was expected. Instead the Imperium formed a token force as it struggles to remain standing over not only the struggle, but scandals that have broken out in the past few days. The Imperium is now in full retreat to low sec space, now staging in the system of Saranen with line members desperately evacuating assets from now occupied territories. Numerous supercapital kills have been seen as Imperium members try to get them out of harms way seen [HERE](URL [HERE](URL [HERE](URL [HERE](URL [HERE](URL and [HERE](URL (yeah, that's a lot). SMA, or Space Monkey's Alliance, left the Imperium (along with losing a few of their major leadership figures, need sources for this please if someone can provide the relevant threads to me). This, along with the constant attacks in the past weeks has seen a massive impact on their alliance seen [HERE](URL and [HERE](URL FCON, another Imperium Alliance, has fallen into decline losing a major corp [HERE](URL In other news, DBRB, one of the Imperium's last remaining FCs, came under public fire after [THIS](URL thread appeared on the reddit. The TLDR is that one of his pilots accidentally made a mistake and got two cheap allies ships killed. DBRB was furious over this, and ordered the line member to repay 500m ISK - over 10 times the value of the ships lost. And last but not least, Elise Randolph kindly wrote a morale speech for the Imperium members to encourage them in this time of hardship [HERE](URL This is kind of a traditional thing for him to do for the poor line members of alliances he views as facing imminent implosion, and something many have been holding out for. --- **Update 11: The Damage a Few Leaked Logs Can Do, and the Outrage it Caused** *12.04.2016 #2** Now, onto the juice of the story. As you may remember from my previous update (10, because I like to be confusing), Lemba, a director of the Korean corporation DOKDO in the Goonswarm Federation (head alliance of the Imperium), defected away from the Imperium for a number of reasons. As promised, a huge number of logs (hundreds of pages in fact) was released, including some very important documents with implications for the Imperium's alliances and casting a dark light on the Mittani's actions. The logs for these can be found [HERE](URL [HERE](URL and [HERE](URL (If there are more, please PM me, I know I missed a few). Now, there's a lot to talk about, so I'll try spread this out for clarity - I'm not going to be able to do it all, so I'm cherry picking the big bits. First of all, the earlier logs provide proof to the concept that was generally known that the alliances in the Imperium were purely a meat shield to protect Goonswarm. The Mittani is quoted quite literally saying he doesn't care at all about FCON, one of their major allies, and that he fully expects a number of them to fall apart from these attacks and merge into Goonswarm. It explains why Goons made only token efforts to defend the space of their allies, and legitimises Co2's defection as clearly the help they were promised was never going to arrive. Instead, these Alliances were expected to simply be absorbed by the main Goonswarm alliance, thus strengthening them immediately after MBC had finished grinding their Alliances down. This is pretty damming because it is essentially telling everyone in the Imperium they existed for one purpose, and on purpose only: to help Goons, and reinforces the concept that they were no more than tools an puppets. The fallout from this has yet to fully play out, and is largely mitigated by these alliances already being in tatters from the war, but has certainly spoken volumes for how Goonswarm operates in its modern iteration. **EDIT**: So there has already been fallout, FCON (the alliance mittani said he didn't care about) and fourth largest alliance in the game has left the Imperium, significantly reducing their strength, as seen [HERE](URL There's a whole bunch of other stuff in the logs of the leadership doing various untoward things, but that's the main bit. Now. This one is the big thing that people have been getting mad over. What is written in the posts below explains what happened very well, I highly suggest looking at them, but the shortened version is this: The Mittani got very upset about the particular character portrait that was released for the Imperium, and is still furious over not getting to choose the name of the war (which he doesn't actually have any right to, but he seems to feel he does). Given CCP has begun using the name everyone else is using - ""World War Bee"" (including, notably, the group who is *winning* the war) - he has taken significant offense. In return, he is seen in logs to apparently be using an article for the International Business Times to force an apology from the PR rep who used the War's name, and has, according to the logs, directly involved their boss. Unsurprisingly, the community is *furious* over his actions, especially as the Goons have a history hurting people's real lives when they don't get their way. This is a game, and these logs, if correct, show him hurting an individual's real life career over some pixels and a name everyone else agrees with. Reddit blew up over this, as seen in just a few threads [HERE](URL [HERE](URL [HERE](URL and [HERE](URL Posts ridiculing his statements have been made such as [THIS](URL piece of propaganda, and support for the employee mentioned [HERE](URL It would also seem the Imperium's line members are losing faith in the leadership given past events, as seen in this article written by one of their own [HERE](URL --- **Update 12: The Media War** *19.04.2016* Sorry for the delay on this one, haven't had a huge amount of time. Without further ado: Next, a somewhat upset PEST diplo is upset about FCON moving into their space, leaked a brief conversation with an FCON diplo about their immediate plans post-Imperium [HERE](URL Apparently the sov map is quite interesting now too, but unfortunately I can't access the links to them where I am right now - I'll work on that. In other news, large portions of deklein sov (goons homeland) has been hit, with several full high-ADM (hard to take) constellations fully taken over. A good writeup of one of these constellation's battles can be found [HERE](URL The Mittani held a 'fireside chat' for the Imperium (just a QA session essentially) about recent events. Link to thread [HERE](URL The fireside was pretty much damage control, and most of what was said is objectively incorrect (in particular the mentions of maintaining sov, and having an increase in players). As for a less 'official' view of CFC, more leaks [HERE](URL Also, the Imperium is rapidly losing sov, as seen [HERE](URL suffering the most losses in a month ever, as seen [HERE](URL and losing members rapidly, as seen [HERE](URL Perhaps the most amusing news you'll see in a while (it's a little late, but definitely funny enough to warrant including). If you recall in the last update, Mittani used his apparent interview with IB Times to threaten CCP and throw his weight around, the quote ""eager to print whatever I tell them"" comes to mind. Well, have a read of the resulting article: [IBTimes on Eve Online](URL and the response on reddit to this article [HERE](URL --- --- **~Very TL;DR~** Big War. Big group attack little group. Little group win. Little group attack big group. Everyone attack big group now. Big group losing. Badly. **Updated:** Big group continuing to lose. Very badly. Big group lost most of their space. Big group starting to lose parts of itself. They're going missing.... --- --- **USEFUL LINKS:** [EN24](URL a popular Eve news website. [Crossing Zebras](URL another Eve news site.

More to come. --- **JOINING OR RETURNING TO EVE** I've gotten so many messages to this effect, I felt I needed to address it here. First, the ""easiest"" way to into the war would probably be Pandemic Horde, who are a newbros alliance who don't require an API key. Alternatively, if you're look for a newbro group who aren't directly *in* the war as such, Brave Newbies is a good choice, for a less involved option. After that it would probably be TEST, who apparently are always recruiting (an inside joke for the new players among us, it's their catchphrase). If you have any specific questions once in game you don't want to ask whichever group you join, feel free to shoot me a PM on ""Phynix Kautsuo"" - I'm always happy to help out. If you are more experienced, joining the group you were previously a part of (if they in the war) is one option, otherwise I suggest looking at [THIS](URL article which lists the groups involved and gives each a short bio. Keep in mind it doesn't list any Imperium Alliances, the main ones being Goonswarm, ~~FCON~~, Razor, Bastion, ~~Space Monkeys~~ and TNT. --- **Edit 2:** Holy hell, my first gold is for an Eve post, thank you kind stranger!!!! **Edit 3: A Book** So I've begun work, after numerous inquiries, on a more complete version of this writeup, which hopefully will allow me to give a far broader picture of the events taking place.

196,vulnerability,Eve,[Game News] Upwell Claims Serpentis Sabotage while Responding to Capsuleer Attacks on Citadel Construction Sites ~Lina Ambre,141,42z3mb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/42z3mb/game_news_upwell_claims_serpentis_sabotage_while/,2016-01-28 06:15:43,"URL [image](URL FD-MLJ, Syndicate Responding to the destruction of prototype citadel construction sites by various capsuleer attackers yesterday, Special Accounts Manager Lee Brinalle held a press conference this afternoon on behalf of the Upwell Consortium, during which she cited evidence of Serpentis sabotage of the sites' defenses. Speaking from the Intaki Bank Depository in FD-MLJ, Lee Brinalle's statement covered a number of points, including the probable cause of the vulnerability of the construction sites and Upwell's response to the apparently opportunistic and, in some cases, organized attacks by capsuleers on the citadel prototype sites. Off the record sources within Upwell affiliated corporations have indicated that consortium leadership is vexed but relatively unperturbed by yesterday's sequel to the construction project launch ceremonies. For her part, Special Accounts Manager Brinalle's delivery of the Upwell statement was typically forthright. For the record, I can confirm reports that the five construction sites the Upwell Consortium established for the assembly of prototype exemplars of our *Astrahus*-class citadel product were raided, attacked and ultimately destroyed by various independent capsuleers and capsuleer organizations. I am also able to confirm that the construction sites were rendered vulnerable by simultaneous failings in the security and shielding systems of the sites and the associated infrastructure that had been placed in them. I wish also to correct reporting from some quarters that yesterday's attacks destroyed prototype citadels in whole or in part. This is not so. Much valuable construction, testing and nanorecording equipment was destroyed, together with stores of components, fuel and the like. However, I would remind the more credulous members of the press that by very simple logic a newly-established construction site is not the thing that is to be constructed there. At this juncture, Ms. Brinalle gestured to representatives of those news outlets dedicated to producing sensational news summaries for the capsuleer market. Continuing with her remarks, Ms. Brinalle revealed details of an intrusion that Upwell are claiming is evidence of sabotage by the Serpentis Corporation. Following the initial attacks, which took place very swiftly after the sites were established, the Upwell Consortium's investigative apparatus quickly detected signs of a wide-spread computer virus attack on the security and shielding systems of the sites. Further investigation has indicated that this computer virus uses artificial intelligence and information mutation techniques outlawed by the Yulai Convention. Upwell's Department of Friendship and Mutual Assistance has been given responsibility for coordinating the investigation and response to this insidious act of sabotage and the outrageous events to which it led. Following the claims of sabotage, the Upwell statement addressed the involvement of independent capsuleers in yesterday's events. As for the action of capsuleers yesterday, we want to begin by noting that in the wake of the attacks themselves a considerable number of capsuleers decried the raids and we know that several pilots recovered Upwell staff in distress, providing assistance and transport to medical facilities as necessary. We would like to commend these actions and say very clearly that we reject the common caricature of the capsuleers as uniformly bloodthirsty, dishonorable and selfish. Furthermore, where other corporate entities in New Eden would consider these events an unmitigated disaster and endeavor to downplay the events of yesterday, the Upwell Consortium believes that full transparency will only help solidify the future of the Citadel Project. Our members and investors remain confident that our shared vision of revolutionizing space colonization and infrastructure is one that is shared also by the mass of capsuleers. We are on a path to realizing the revolutionary, beneficial changes that citadels will bring to our civilization among the stars, while providing platforms for our capsuleer citizens to help build and shape the future for us all. Having said all this, we utterly deplore the attacks on our equipment and people by those capsuleers who chose the path of opportunism and insensate violence. We know that many of these wanton acts were almost random and unthinking, with the destruction of most sites a consequence of the cumulative acts of barbarism perpetrated by the vandal capsuleers. However, in at least one particularly egregious act of systematic destruction, a site was razed by the organized, collective action of members of a capsuleer alliance resident here in Syndicate. The members of 'The OSS' alliance should be in no doubt that their actions will have consequences. In the first place, all current and future individual members of 'The OSS' are barred from participation in Upwell Consortium research and prototyping efforts, with immediate effect. If any members of those organizations have already contracted components to me they may take this statement as notice that such materials are forfeit. Secondly, while this alliance has been a valuable customer of Intaki Bank services, not least here on this station, we will be reviewing the relationship. No precipitate action will be taken but the Intaki Bank, and other Upwell Consortium members, reserve the right to cancel agreements, without notice or refund, if aggressive acts of the kind we have seen continue. Certainly, in this region it is the Station Owners Council of the Intaki Syndicate that, to quote ISP Security Commander Elteroumie, 'says what goes and what don't go'. My advice is that certain parties should bear this in mind. Now, m'sieurs and m'dames, we will later share a more thorough, up-to-the-minute report with your news organizations and we will be certain to notify you when we are ready to resume the construction initiative. We expect this to be in a matter of days, just as soon as the Department of Friendship and Mutual Assistance is satisfied that the relevant systems have been purged of foreign routines and, indeed, after we have taken steps to correct the vigilance of technical staff at the sites. It could be argued, and I do argue, that the actions of the Serpentis and a few renegade capsuleer corporations have allowed us to refine our plans in invaluable ways. More importantly, the Upwell Consortium values our strong relationships with capsuleers across New Eden and we know how important their contributions have been to the universe we share. We will not let a few rogue actors deter us from delivering a marvel of engineering to the majority of the pilots of New Eden. On the financials, this was certainly a loss but, frankly, at this stage the loss was minor. That said, to alleviate any concerns going forward, we will be renewing construction of the prototype citadels and we are maintaining our request for the required research components from capsuleers across New Eden. All defensive measures will be active at the re-established sites and construction should continue normally. We believe unwavering adherence to our path forward sends a stronger message to the future of new Eden than suspending progress indefinitely or hunting down nihilist gangsters. After all, the Citadels themselves represent defiance. Defiance against the inherent dangers of space. Defiance against impossible odds and inconceivable logistical problems. They are the future of humanity and we shall remain resolute in the face of any and all that would attempt to challenge or block the realization of this vision. Ms. Brinalle declined to take questions from the floor and the Scope has been unable to secure an interview with any official of Upwell Consortium or its member corporations on these matters. "
197,vulnerability,Eve,The Venus Fly Trap,0,43wxqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/43wxqf/the_venus_fly_trap/,2016-02-03 10:24:18," Im posting from my phone so forgive any typos. I also haven't had s chance to sit and fully think this through so hopefully it isn't a giant pile of garbage The recent post about apple trees in null sec got me thinking of what I believe would be a very interesting mechanic around mining outposts involving stealing the ore inside. I was never a fan of the siphon units because I feel they were to easily mitigated and also required the thief to return to the scene to collect his goodies. Like all new structures I have no doubts that mining outposts will get vulnerability timers to be destroyed/conquered whatever. I propose they have a smaller timer within that timer when they can be hacked using the data analyzer and playing a beefed up version of the existing hacking mini game. Unlike the current version where iirc you have three chances before your loot blows up, against a mining outpost you only get one shot. Success and you can loot up to 30% of the silo, and no one ever knows you were there. Failure however is where it gets interesting. Should you fail the hack the outpost defends itself by applying the Venus Fly Trap, a hic scram and a 99% web effect on the offending ship that lasts for 10 minutes. It also sends the owning Corp a mail allowing them to investigate and blap the hapless thief, if they can form in 10 minutes. And if the thief has friends well then PVP happens. The system encourages occupancy because repeated failures to respond to hacking attempts on your mining outpost will seriously dent if not eliminate your profits nothing to stop you from getting hacked three times in an hour. To compensate that though the hacking needs to be hard as balls for example with max skills and optimal play hacking an XL outpost should have a MAX 50% success rate. 60% large 70% medium 80% small.

Furthermore 6h on Large and 21h for the XL. Now if alliance *USAUSA* would want to evict alliance *RUSRUS* this can prove to be very problematic. *RUSRUS* has set their vulnerability windows on all structures of the same size match their weekly primetime on Saturday, say 1500 ET. For the XL this vulnerability window has been spread over 2-3 days to make it fit in the *RUSRUS* primetime. For *USAUSA* to have a nice fight they would have to do the following: * 1) Get up crazy early because their TZ is almost opposite of *RUSRUS* (one could argue you should find a different enemy). * 2a) RF 2 structures (30 minutes per structure with DMG mitigation). Including traveltime between targets this would be a 1,5 hour OP, which I think is long enough for structure bashing. * 2b) You don't get enough numbers to peacefully spend 1,5 hours in hostile space and you get forced off the structures, resulting in no timers being created. (At least there was a fight). * 3) You come back for the timers and have a fight. * 4) You wait an entire week for hostile targets to become vulnerable and try again. (Meanwhile hitting nothing, because all timers from *RUSRUS* is perfectly sync'd). This would mean that you have **only a few** (maybe only one) fight(s) over structures **every week**, all centered in one timezone. The other time-zones cannot even hit a target because they are all invulnerable.

200,vulnerability,Eve,How to Make the Rorqual Less of a Yawn-zone,318,3rb4kd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3rb4kd/how_to_make_the_rorqual_less_of_a_yawnzone/,2015-11-03 15:05:10,"Brass tacks: The Rorqual is awesome. Its boosts are fucking amazeballs and its gameplay is some of the most engaging in EVE. Recently, I investigated how one should go about optimizing their time in this industrial powerhouse, and after discussing the topic with the briniest nullcrabs in Bovril I have distilled the essence of Rorq piloting into three complex but essential steps: * Take a Wing/Fleet Booster role * Turn on your boosts in a POS * Go on vacation Now I know this is already thrill-a-minute kind of stuff, but as a member in EVE's premier asteroid-combating corporation, I still feel as though I could offer some slight tweaks to make this thing less of a Snooze-fest and more of a [Crews-fest](URL **1) Capital-Sized Mining Lasers/Bonuses**. I want to lube you bitches up with the easy fixes first so I don't split you down the middle with the industrial shaft of genius. If we want to coax the reclusive Rorqual out of its POS, we have to give it a reason to leave- and with on-grid boosting still somehow *unpossible*, the most *duh* suggestion out there is to implement Capital-sized everything. Strip miners, ice miners, gas huffers, the whole slew of them- T1 and T2 variations- and the crystals to trick them out even further. **OR,** if you don't want to install all-new assets for essentially one ship, give the Rorq ungodly buffs to normal-sized mining gear. But that would be the :poor: choice, wouldn't it, CCP? And we don't like :poors: in this house. **2) Asteroid Tractor Beams**. Still fairly easy here- the Rorq is again encouraged to sit on-field, but it can tractor rocks within its range rather than having to slowboat around like some kind of peasant. This ship is the god of the forge given form, the fucking Hephastus of New Eden, and do you think this thing is going to be moving around from rock to rock? FUCK NO. The Rorqual tells the asteroids to *get their sexy asses over here* and the asteroids fucking listen. **3) Fleet Hangars**. Whaaaat? That's right, give this soot-choked cathedral some space to launch ships out of. Let's say... enough m3 for 15-20 Cruisers, with anything bigger than a Medium-sized hull disallowed. *But I thought the ideas were supposed to get cooler as you go on*, you whine. Well sit your thirsty ass back down because I'm about to drop a Spod-sized bomb on your ass. **4) INDUSTRIAL SUPERWEAPONS**. [You know what to do.](URL * **Seismic Detonation:** First of all, [it would sound like this](URL Now then, with the important stuff out of the way: Whether through module or mode-changing, the Rorq would blow up all asteroids in a given area and turn them into ready-to-collect ore. To balance it, say that the Rorq has to ""spool up"" to do this for X many minutes; the weapon doesn't go off until the end of that charge period. During that charge time, the Rorq cannot move, warp, or jump, and it appears on everyone's overview, a la cynosural fields. This ability would come with a big cooldown and would cost a lot of fuel, and maybe disallow jumping for a time afterwards, like a Titan's DD currently does. If you want to go *really* [crazygonuts](URL have it deal X much omnidamage in that area. Its not like ships didn't have a chance to get the fuck out the way. * **""Redoubt"" Forcefield:** So you and your merry band of nullbears get jumped on by some door-to-door content salesmen, and now all those long hours you spent ~~afk ratting in an ishtar~~ ~~jacking it to MLP fanfiction~~ *tirelessly earning hard-won iskies* are up in the air as your Rorqual comes under assault. But all is not lost. The Rorq could pop up something like an ungodly lovechild of the current POS Forcefields and the planned Citadel DPS-Caps to give itself precious time to call for help. Again, the Rorq becomes immobilized and a big ol' beacon lights up on everyone's Overview like a neon sign that reads KILLMAILS THIS WAY. Friendly ships are allowed inside the FF and hostile/neutrals are not, and ships inside the FF can't be targeted- all like the POS. This particular forcefield takes the place of the Rorq's own shields, however- so while the Rorq's defenses are increased for the moment, help had better arrive quick because there are no reinforcement timers with this FF. Once its gone, its gone, and while a few passing cruisers probably couldn't overcome it, a dread or two certainly can, and so can a dedicated fleet. This FF might only last 10 minutes or so, after which time it cannot be reactivated again for some time. The idea is not just to make the Rorqual an ore-sucking behemoth, but to make it a content centerpiece. I always have a thousand horrible ideas for extra shit but the point is that this ship will be better only when it is *part of the action*, not just some sidelined quarterback and/or glorified boost boat. I see a Rorq getting jumped, popping its shields, miners reshipping into combat ships in the fleet hangar to try to kill off enemy tackle while both sides rageping for support fleets. Boom, ten minutes later (or sooner if the attackers bring enough DPS to overcome the FF's caps) you have potentially large-scale content, no need for alarm-clocking or waiting for vulnerability windows. No need for entosis mechanics. You just have pure, unadulterated *gudfights*. I need a cigarette and a wetnap. #EDIT NUMERO UNO **MORE SUPERWEAPONS** * **Moon Mining Array-** Stolen shamelessly from /u/INITMalcanis, we could use the Rorq as a platform to shift those sweet, sweet moon minerals away from an Alliance-level only income stream and into a source of revenue for those willing to put their Herald of Geologic Rearrangement on the line. The Rorq could use a short but intense Siege cycle to harvest the moon minerals- maybe 2.5 minutes or so- which would use a shitton of fuel but would allow for a decent yield. I'm really salty I didn't think of this one myself, because moon minerals are some of the biggest conflict-drivers out there, so props to Malcanis for reminding me about this option. * **High-Res Asteroid Scanner-** Probably one of my more *""My God, he's gone mad with upvotes!""* ideas, but whatever, Tuesdays are not for the faint of heart. Give the Rorq some sort of scanner or whatever that allows a more accurate ore extraction plan for a given asteroid. The effect would be one of two things: **Either** Players mining that rock would get a set amount of bonus ore per miner cycle (such that, for instance, a rock with 10km3 would leave a fleet with 12km3 by the time it's mined out), **Or** the scanner would alter the nature of the asteroid itself such that it becomes the next-best quality of that flavor of asteroid (so a vanilla rock becomes a +5%, a +5% becomes a +10%). This last option would mean that the Rorq could essentially create a +15% asteroid variation."

After derping around in Highsec, and once I got a cloak in Lowsec for some exploration, I joined a (smaller) WH corp recently with a friend. Well, as a young player, the call of ISK is very strong, so we were a bit daring and decided to ninja-mine some gas in a connected WH. It was a great time, I got around 35 M in C320, quite a sum for me, and once all sites had spawns, we decided to return to our homeplace. This is when things started to go wrong. We had to jump through a previously empty C4 wormhole, however, there were now several sigs on dscan, and we wanted to get the f*** out of there. Well, easier said than done, because when we warped to our hole, a bubble was already waiting for us. My friend sadly did not make it out, but I managed to warp to a nearby planet, cloak up and hide. But if you think this is the end, no, this is only the beginning. I wanted to sit them out, but they were smarter. They rolled the WH, so I could not get out anymore. And due to my inexperience, I did not bring the valuable core probe launcher that I should have had with me. So, I was stranded in space, no way out. Except... I decided to contact them via the local chat, and try to bargain my way out. In the end, what did I have to lose? We had a tough negotiation, but ultimately we could find an agreement, which comprised me leaving my ship and cargo behind. So I warped to the dedicated spot, and once I ejected, I got a fleet invite, and was safely guided into K-space and made it back to Jita. I have to suck up the loss of my gas miner, but I got to keep my (few) implants. I was stunned, I would have expected them to take advantage of my vulnerability, but they honored their contract, like men of honor. I learned several valuable lessons this day. * Always carry a mobile depot and a core probe launcher. * Eve is not only a ship simulator, but also a politics game. Be nice, but determined, and you might be rewarded. * Never give up, until you are podded. * And lastly, always, ALWAYS, carry a mobile depot and a core probe launcher. o7"

Lets start with ###Defensive regeneration on Entosis targets### All structures that can be captured by Entosis Link modules will now have the ability to automatically regenerate towards defender control. This applies to Infrastructure Hubs, Territorial Claim Units, Conquerable Stations/Outposts, Station Service Modules, and Command Nodes. If one of these structures has a defender alliance, then the structure will slowly capture itself on behalf of that alliance whilst it is idle. The rate of defensive regeneration is fixed for each type, and is unaffected by any modifier such as the Activity Defense Multiplier. [image](URL This Command Node has been idle for around 10 minutes, and so will automatically capture for the defenders after a further 88 minutesFor structures with daily vulnerability intervals, when the structure has completely re-secured itself by defensive regeneration, it will be able to enter an invulnerable period as normal. If any ship begins capturing a structure with an Entosis Link module (after the module has completed its warm-up cycle), the defensive regeneration is disabled. If a ship stops capturing the structure for any reason, the structure will immediately resume the defensive regeneration. As a defender, manually re-securing your structures (or capturing your Command Nodes) with an Entosis Link module will always be faster than relying on the defensive regeneration. It does mean however that you aren't always forced to re-fit in order to undo a small amount of capture progress by an uncommitted attacker once youve chased him off. Just keep the area secure from further interference and the structure will take care of itself. Note that if a Station Service Module has been completely disabled by an attacker, it will not have any regeneration and will need to be manually re-enabled by the defender. However an enabled Station Service Module that has partial attacker progress but was not fully disabled will be able to regenerate back to fully secured. The following table shows the regeneration times for each type of item. (Values are unchanged from the previous blog) | | Base capture time (sec)| Regen Speed Multiplier| Regeneration time (min)| |:-|:-|:-|:-| | Station service| 235| x 0.04| 98| | Station| 595| x 0.20| 50| | IHub| 595| x 0.20| 50| | TCU| 595| x 0.20| 50| | Command node| 325| x 0.40| 98 (neutral starting point)*| ** An unattended capture node event will self-complete in 196 minutes (assuming all solar systems in the constellation have been visited by at least one player since downtime)* Command Nodes linked to the same parent structure will regenerate independently of one another. When one Command Node is being manually captured, any other related idle node will still continue to regenerate by itself. Any command node that completes 100% regeneration will count as being captured by the defenders, and award them 5% progress to the overall campaign as normal. Command Nodes associated with a free-ported station will not have any defensive regeneration, as there is no defender alliance in this scenario. ###Manual Online/Offline Control of Infrastructure Hub Upgrades### For those not familiar with Infrastructure Hubs and their associated Infrastructure Upgrades, the upgrades are items that can be installed in an IHub in order to provide some kind of bonus or ability within a solar system. These include extra pirate/asteroid spawns or the ability to anchor certain restricted starbase structures such as Cynosural System Jammers or Supercapital Ship Assembly Arrays. Infrastructure Upgrades are similar to rigs in that once installed they cannot be removed. Some upgrades also add to the weekly upkeep bill that the owner of the IHub is required to pay. This means that an IHub can become quite expensive to run if it includes upgrades that are only required on a temporary basis. [image](URL The Infrastructure Hub Management UI now allows you to configure Strategic upgrades, and shows you the weekly cost for the current configurationPrior to the release of the new Sovereignty system in the Aegis release, one workaround for this forced billing cost was to use multiple IHubs. An alliance would launch two IHubs in a system, one fitted with the high-upkeep upgrades and one without. They could then offline one and online the other, letting them switch between different billing levels according to their current circumstances. With the Aegis release the mechanics of activating IHubs changed, such that only a single IHub could ever be launched in a solar system at a time. The only way to switch to a new IHub would be to destroy the old one. This obviously makes it extremely cost (and time) inefficient to swap out IHubs just to avoid paying upkeep for an upgrade module that isn't currently required. We are therefore introducing the ability to switch Strategic Upgrades on and off once they are installed in an IHub. (Strategic Upgrades are the only type that increase the weekly IHub bill) When a Strategic Upgrade is switched off, any starbase structures dependent on it will immediately go offline. These structures cannot be put back online without first switching the Upgrade back on. If the structure is currently running any industry jobs, these jobs will be immediately paused for as long it remains offline. When the next weekly IHub bill is generated, any disabled upgrades will not count towards the bill value. We've also added a new 'Weekly Cost' label to the IHub management UI that shows you the next billing amount for the current upgrade configuration. This label will update as you switch upgrades on or off. If you have a keen eye for details, you might now be thinking that you can save some ISK by switching off an upgrade just before the next bill is generated, and then switch it back on just after. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this is already accounted for: When installing a new upgrade, or switching on an existing upgrade, you will now be required to pay an upfront activation cost. This cost is equal to the weekly upkeep for that item, and must be paid by the character performing the action. Given the strategic importance of some upgrades, switching them off can only be done by a character with Director roles in the corporation owning the IHub. Installing a new upgrade or switching on an existing upgrade only requires the Configure Starbase role. ###Sovereignty Structure Self-destruct### Following on from configurable infrastructure upgrades, another requested feature was the ability for corporations to manually remove their own sovereignty structures without having to have a different alliance come along and complete a multi-day capture process. We are now adding a Self-Destruct option to Infrastructure Hubs and Territorial Claim Units. This will provide a quicker way for an alliance to tear down their assets in a solar system. "

204,vulnerability,Eve,Warning: Sovereignty suggestion by a non sovholder incoming.,0,3l51iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3l51iy/warning_sovereignty_suggestion_by_a_non_sovholder/,2015-09-16 16:13:40,"So, this is one of the things that just came to mind. If sovereignty is based upon who holds the system and the idea is that you actually have to live in your system in order to hold onto it. Why aren't we using the system indexes themselves to claim sovereignty? Instead of this random ""Capture the flag"" game of chasing random crap around. Why not base it entirely off of the indexes. Whoever literally uses the space by mining, ratting, and whatever the hell the strategic index is, the most owns the system. I think that the industrial index would need to be expanded, just mining being counted is silly (But I'm pretty sure CCP has plans for that anyways, especially with Citadels incoming). But other than that? Meh. You take sov by actually using the space. Your warriors are still needed to protect your borders and keep people from messing with your carebears. It gives null alliances a reason to have an industrial wing still, it gives them a reason to keep around people to defend that wing. It rewards them for the ratting they're already doing. It rewards alliances for having a well rounded timezone coverage instead of punishing anyone not in your primary timezone. Current sovholder is capable of building up a certain amount of points that require the attacker to overcome before their sovereignty is actually threatened. Those points DON'T respawn, so if you're not there and you're only repping up your borders every few weeks, it's possible for smaller entities to nibble a little at a time. It avoids the organizational requirements of having to manage thousands of timers. The N+1 Blob will always reign supreme but a smaller entity would have the ability to possibly strategically bottleneck systems. Most of all it removes trolling as a way to harass sov holders. Someone CFC sized could absolutely kick your teeth in no matter what you do if you decide you want a piece of branch or Deklein, but they aren't just going to be able to go sit on Provi and fuck shit up without committing a pretty sizable amount of assets. Roaming gangs can either be dealt with militarily or carebears can safe up and wait them out. A random roaming gang that has no interest in holding sov won't have the ability to significantly impact sovereignty holders. Defender has the advantage, as an attacker must literally seed in every industrial ship and ratting ship and must put bodies IN those ships that can't be committed to defense. You start playing the game of whether or not to try to blitz the system as fast as possible at the risk of losing a lot of ships or to do it slower and steadily with more people waiting to defend. It becomes very much an asset and personnel management issue. No more chasing around uncatchable things, no more watching a laser do stuff. People either fight for their space or they don't. If CCP wants to keep trolling around as a legitimate playstyle, they can make it so Entosis links still shut off station services and maybe offline system upgrades. Same vulnerability requirements, same bonuses for indexes and such. You could make someone's space pretty damn annoying to live in but you'd have to harass them for a very, very long time in order to make them move out just because you turned off their clone bay."
205,vulnerability,Eve,[Sov Ideas] Pace of Campaign vs Individual Event Grind,19,3l5xay,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3l5xay/sov_ideas_pace_of_campaign_vs_individual_event/,2015-09-16 22:33:04,"In the CSM Summit minutes from Day 1 we saw an interesting debate over the current sov mechanics. &gt;Sion - It's also way too fast, it's unthinkable we could have killed so many ihubs in 3 days. &gt;Larrikin - Do you think this is a bad thing? &gt;Sion - Yeah, it should feel epic, that's what's great. These big logistics chains, big name FCs, that kind of thing. With this speed, we can wipe a whole region in a week, this needs to be drawn out, there needs to be an actual fight. &gt;Mike - Wasn't the aim to break up the fights and make them smaller? If so, that's a good success. &gt;Sion - This is where we're really losing players, there's no support structure for this huge war style now because it doesn't happen. As you gradually step down the epicness of warfare, there's less motivation to take part. Now it's easy to look at this and say this is a cry for the old system where sov was made slower across the board by walls of HP. In reality this is looking at things not from the perspective of individual timer, but across the swath of a campaign. We did see under Dominion, that when a defender was active, wars ended up concentrated in single system and single battles because of the need to concentrate large amounts of DPS on single objectives. We aren't seeing that happen in Aegis for a lot of reasons. The systems naturally spreads out fights across constellations and that's fine. But there's a unintended multiplying effect that happens by RF'ing the whole constellation in a single go. You end up with multiple nodes for multiple structures across a single system and you can actually concentrate a great deal of your effort in a few systems. This is part of the reason you see the pace of campaigns as fast as it was in Providence. My interpretation of Sion's argument is that the Pace of a Campaign, not necessarily the pace of an individual timer, needs to be slowed down. This means each individual battle means more. But how do you do this? Well I'm bad at math but one thought is a constellation wide ADM that is an average of or based off system ADM's and then used to create what is essentially a reinforcement stacking penalty. Reinforcing structures in one or two systems maybe easy but trying to do subsequent ones will be harder. This would concentrate fights into being over a smaller area. Again this isn't about trying to increase the grind of individual events, but to effect the pace of an overall campaign. As I said in the minutes thread, fighting an active defender in Eve should feel like the Eastern Front in Winter, not Iraq 2003 ~Future Structures Caveat~ How would this play out in a future system where we have more than 3 structures per system? Where we could potentially have 2000 XL Citadels in one system? Well that would seem to naturally force everyone into fighting over one system and the weekly vulnerability windows of citadels would seem to extend the pace of a campaign. Although we don't know what the windows will be like on other structures we can assume they will be longer as Citadels are supposed to be the most secure. In this case I think the reinforcement stacking penalty would have to be system based and would have to be triggered or increased by reinforcement in each subsequent system. When you start to think about this though you can see how trying to develop an iterate the sov mechanics, which are slightly ahead of structures must be a challenge. "
206,vulnerability,Eve,"Open letter to CCP, CSM: Factional Warfare",275,3la3ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3la3ft/open_letter_to_ccp_csm_factional_warfare/,2015-09-17 18:38:51,"Hey-o, FW and PVE discussion happens today at the CSM panel, and Im worried, to say the least, about what that title implies for the upcoming changes to FW that have been rumored about lately. CCP will be in congress with CSM today about my favorite part of EVE, one that does not necessarily attract the most outspoken of communities, but nevertheless contains one of the largest content drivers in the game - one that is several years old and in dire need of attention. **A brief intro about me**, because I dont post on reddit *too* terribly much and I want you to understand where I come from, since despite my corp ticker, Im usually one of the less vocal members in my corp: Ive played EVE for almost two years now, and Ive risen to become a director or CEO of every player corp Ive been a part of (all 3 of them on my main, heh). I have experience in hisec (mostly industry and missions; have yet to try incursions), wormholes (both in lifestyle and as mere daytrips), sov-nullsec (CFC during Dominion; TEST briefly at the start of Aegis), and, mostly, lowsec (piracy and FW). More than half of my time in this game has been in FW as part of Dirt n Glitter, and before that, I was an active director of Scope Works. I joined DNG during the start of Burn Huola last year, when Amarr had a mere handful of systems, and since then, the Amarr-Minmatar warzone is coming to the completion of an entire pendulum cycle. At a particularly low point in content availability, I led DNG to check out Aegissov with TEST alliance, and upon returning to FW, started up our current alliance Local is Primary. I love FW, I want it to thrive, and I love the many successes its achieved thus far. Unfortunately, the FW system also has a great number of flaws, and for the sake of wanting to see my corp/alliance/militias members continue to have fun for months and years to come (and the same for all militias, not just Amarr), its important to me that CCP hears from those of us who are not and have not been accurately represented in CSM but who make up much of the small-gang content present in EVE. There is plenty of change happening in nullsec, but FW is receiving almost no mention at all in these discussions. I dont want FW to be left by the wayside and merely patched with band-aids, like Im worried could happen today. **A balance pass of the tier system** Personally, Id call for its removal entirely, but at least until ihub upgrades start becoming individually worthwhile, basing the entire balance of the warzone on such an arbitrary mechanic is comically misrepresentative of militia efforts. The current system heavily penalizes the losing militia until the winning side has oversaturated its own LP value. This pendulum makes the PVE component entirely seasonal: in the Amarr/Minmatar warzone, each side has approximately 3-4 months of the year to farm their hearts out, while the other 8-9 months its entirely infeasible because either LP is oversaturated or payouts are revoltingly penalized. I imagine the Cal/Gal warzone is even worse. **Corp Incentives** LP payouts are great for newer players, but outside of the few months each year for prime farming time, most veterans pay for their PVP habits through other means. This has several implications, but when players graduate from the low-SP, low-ISK, new-to-pvp culture, they usually just become pirates, in which case they get to shoot twice as many people. There are effectively zero (0!) corp benefits for FW, mechanically. Instead, we get limited access to hisec, cant dock in enemy controlled systems, and when FW corps/alliances are active participants in a war, they have fewer resources (time, isk, warm bodies) to spare towards fighting against pirate corps. There should be rewards, more than just monetary, for corps to be active in FW. The empires should be rewarding their most successful corps and alliances by providing strategic benefits. A few examples: * Militia-exclusive bonuses for upgraded ihubs (bonuses dont apply for neutrals) * Additional defense timers and/or smaller vulnerability windows for upcoming structures * FW-oriented corp income. LP taxing, for instance: add an LP wallet to corps, retrievable by members with wallet roles * Reduced-cost and/or free ship repairs, based on ihub upgrades * Reduction in structure fuel costs for ihub upgrades * FW-specific structures, such as an intel structure that sends in-game notifications to players/corps/alliances when the enemy militia captures a plex in the system (home systems, etc) **Strategic benefits for geographic control** One of the big goals with Aegis-sov is geographic significance. Constellation layout and tactics play a big part in defending your sov, with chokepoints being valuable, and buffer systems being important safeguards for ratters, miners, etc. Nullsec alliances also have system indexes based on activity. Oddly enough, nullsec entities are the only real force that have such geographic value assigned to which systems they control. FW, on the other hand, is comparable to a real-world war. I envision militia leaders in smoky rooms looking at war maps and discussing which systems are better to attack, and how come. Right now, locational value is nothing other than docking access. Given how stretched out the conflict is in FW compared to null, though, its the perfect environment for assigning value to owning many systems in constellations and even regions, in the way of deplex timers: Systems would have control indexes similar to in nullsec, but instead of having shorter vuln windows based on ownership length and pve content, plexes would have shorter deplex timers based on system ihub level, and how many systems the respective empire has in the constellation and region. * For owning an entire region and having a fully upgraded ihub, deplexing in that system might have up to a 50% reduction in deplex timer length, making homedef easier * Organizing an attack against a cluster of systems would involve strategic thinking, because as ihubs are destabilized and systems are claimed, it becomes harder for the defenders **Better API / CREST tools** Just like kills are public via CREST, so should plex captures. When a player of any militia captures a plex, the following information should be publicly available: * System = Asghed * LP awarded = 5,000 * Size = Novice * VP awarded: 20 (or -20 for deplexing) * Time = 2015.09.17 05:40:00 * Characters = Nikolai Agnon, Edeity, Odysseus Olacar * Corporations = Dirt n Glitter, Holy Amarrian Battlemonk, Calibrated Chaos * Alliances = Local Is Primary, Habitual Chaos * Militia = Amarr Empire I personally have written a program that tallies my corps FW activity - our members love it, because [they can track how many plexes they capture and in what systems](URL Unfortunately, its awfully round-about in how it has to be implemented. I wont discuss my programs specifics here*, but I want timerboards and live-feed maps available for the FW warzones just like what exists for sov. Naturally, itll be up to players to build such programs, but we need better API and/or CREST tools to work with. *I will probably post the code and an explanation thereof in the near future. In an ideal world, everything my program does now should be public for everyone involved in militia efforts.* I want lowsec booming, I want FW to reach a golden age, I want all the militias to thrive. Even the Minmatar and Gallente, in-game grievances aside. Lowsec is where non-blobfest PVP happens, and FW makes it happen every single day. Itd be nice to get some love, though. FW is not just pve. Its a content magnet, and it needs help. Please give us some attention, CCP. *Edit: Formatting is hard*"

You may be surprised that we are going to discuss structure protection and attack yet again, a point already tackled in [Citadels, Sieges and You](URL This is mostly due to our quite radical change in direction regarding what we would like to achieve regarding structure assault mechanics a shift that happened after reading feedback from various sources and extensively debating that point with the CSM. #Entosis links are not going to work on new structures# [image](URL Long story short, we have had long meetings about the structure attack system, and came to the conclusion that, while Entosis Links do indeed achieve our design goals for the Citadels, they are not actually delivering an experience we are satisfied to provide. * Its not fun being shot by massive structure weapons while being unable to retaliate in kind, it gives players the feeling to be helpless while they watch a timer go down * There is gameplay involved in applying damage that Entosis Links do not preserve, like range, speed, falloff or positioning * It devalues capital ships as a whole, especially Dreadnoughts, which were specifically introduced to assault and destroy static structures * Last but not least, there is a visceral connection in shooting a structure down to destroy it. Having guns blazing while watching the target hit points go down is a very strong visual and adrenaline factor that Entosis Links remove out of the equation. **So, there are several points that come out of this:** * We are going to make sure we have mechanics in place to prevent problems with the existing Starbases specifically that HP damage always benefits whoever brings the most ships in the field, since damage always scales by number. That is why incoming damage will be mitigated past a certain point (more on this below). * This will not affect the current Aegis Sovereignty system. We have plans to merge those systems when we move Sovereignty into the new structures and we will account for the specific needs of the Aegis Sovereignty system when that happens * We are aware Capital Ship are in the pipelines to be rebalanced, and bringing HP damage back into structures is not a coincidence. We want both structures and capitals to have a strong tie with each other, a binding theme delivers a unified and enriching experience. As such, the Capital Ship rebalance will definitely account for this HP damage system for structures * Wormhole space presents unique gameplay we want to preserve whenever possible. As such, variations will be made in the attack system for this specific area when we feel they are justified * *All of the numbers, timers in this blog are still up to discussion and debate.* If anything, we do believe we have proven so far that we were willing to listen to feedback and change our designs accordingly, so please make sure to remember those are not final numbers yet #Meet the new structure attack process# With that in mind lets have a look on how the new attack process is going to look like. [image](URL We wanted to simplify it as much as possible next to [the previous version](URL You will notice we merged the online and reinforced states altogether, which technically work the same way (the structure cannot be shot) we also introduced the concept of a repair timer. More on that later. We also removed the concept of three vulnerability and reinforced states. Since structures can now be damaged through regular means, we are simply going to represent that by using structure shields, armor and hull, which is a much more visual and familiar way to represent structure attack phases. ##Vulnerable state## A structure enters this state during the weekly vulnerability window or after it has been anchored / unanchored. Damage can be applied to the structure in this state. When any kind of damage is received, the structure enters a repair state. The weekly vulnerability window design hasnt changed much from the last blog. This still represents a specific amount of hours that have to be assigned on a weekly basis, during which the structure will be vulnerable. Hours are assigned on a calendar and players with proper roles have control when they should happen. What has changed however, is that the vulnerability window will not vary based on Sovereignty indexes anymore, as this we realized it would cause management nightmares when trying to apply vulnerability hours while Sovereignty indexes are changing. Sovereignty indexes will instead modify repair timers (see below). | Citadel weekly vulnerability window| M| L| XL| |:-|:-|:-|:-| | All areas of space| 3 hours| 6 hours| 21 hours| **Example from the last blog in case people missed it:** Soft Croissant Incorporated is a small 5 man corporation having a Large Citadel structure in high security space with 6 hours of weekly vulnerability window. Not being a hardcore gamer, the structure owner decides to set the vulnerability window 2 hours during Tuesday evening and 4 hours on Saturday. During that time the structure will be vulnerable to damage (a war declaration is still needed to shoot a structure in high-security space). [image](URL ##Invulnerable state## The structure cannot be attacked through any means when in this state. It serves to protect the owner assets, pauses gameplay and gives a chance for all players within different time zones to interact with each other. * It is the most common structure state, encountered when a structure is operating normally, being anchored or unanchored, or after a successful attack by external parties * Unlike existing Starbases, the new structures will not use fuel when invulnerable. In fact they will not use fuel at all by themselves. Fuel consumption has been moved to service modules, which will use a new type of fuel blocks, made of the materials from all existing fuel blocks, plus strontium clathrates. This will be explained further on a separate blog on Structure acquisition and composition materials **Invulnerable state duration:** * Shields will be invulnerable all the time, except if the structure is within one of the weekly vulnerability window mentioned above * When vulnerable and attacked, if shields hit points reach 0, the structure will become invulnerable for a specific amount of time (this is the equivalent of the old reinforcement timer). Exactly how this is going to last is still up for debate. We are discussing various options, like a fixed time on existing Starbase reinforcements, or the system we had in [the previous blog](URL More details as we get them * This process is repeated for hull: when armor reaches 0 hit points, structure will become invulnerable for a specific amount of time after which hull will become vulnerable to attack ##Repair state## Any damaged structure that is in a vulnerable state will automatically try to repair its shields, armor or hull after a specific amount of time. Unlike regular ship shields, this is not an on-going regeneration process its like a shield booster or armor repairer that would instantly restore all hit points after a specific cycle time has passed. Please note this will not happen if the structure is invulnerable. It will not be possible to accelerate the process using any kind of remote repair modules "
208,vulnerability,Eve,Yet Another Suggestion for Structures (Why can't we have the best of both worlds?),0,3lr9vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3lr9vt/yet_another_suggestion_for_structures_why_cant_we/,2015-09-21 12:59:20,"Combine the benefits of Entosis Links with Ship DPS: OK, so here's my suggestion on how to make citadels better and how things would be played out. This could be modified to apply to other structures too. First things first, the citadel is in its vulnerability window. I fly up with my entosis link and begin entosising the citadel. The time it takes to entosis is dependent on where the citadel is located (hi sec, null, and W-space. Length to entosis in null is dependent on system indexes). Entosising works just like it currently does. I cannot warp, receive remote reps. Once entosising is complete the citadels shields become vulnerable. Ships can start shooting the shields but the structure will not have a massive amount of hit points. A small gang should get through the shields in about 5-10 minutes while a large fleet could just blap it. The idea is that the majority of the time will be taken by entosising and a fleet can chew through the shield hit points quickly. Once the shields are gone the citadel goes into reinforce. Once the citadel exits reinforcement, I can entosis again to make the armor vulnerable. Just like I did with the shields, once I have completed entosising I can shoot the armor. After the armor is gone the citadel goes into its final reinforcement. I entosis again for a third time to make the hull vulnerable. I then shoot through the hull and the structure blows up. All loot is subjugated to the currently proposed asset safety mechanics (assets are saved in k-space but lost in w-space). This should provide the benefit of not needing large fleets to take out structures while still ensuring people get the satisfaction of blowing something up and receiving a juicy kill mail. This is my first attempt at coming up with an idea to improve structures and I know theres a lot to still be fleshed out (how long entosising should take, how many hit points the structure should have, should freeporting be a thing?) but this is the basic mechanics of how I think it should work. Also I would like to see my ideas somehow modified to improve game play in wormholes, I know waiting through two reinforcement timers in a wormhole can be a pain. TL;DR: Entosis -&gt; destroy shields -&gt; reinforce -&gt; entosis -&gt; destroy armor -&gt; reinforce -&gt; entosis -&gt; destroy hull -&gt; receive kill mail Any constructive feedback is welcome o7"

Been having issues running into their EWAR/Logistics wing since they readily fly 2:1 dps/ewar/logi ratios. Even with that bullshit we still can pick off guys and pull a few kills each skirmish. We're also able to reinforce quite a few things while engaging in skirmishes. Been consistently putting up 3+ timers a night for Bane to deal with which we then harass them while they take nodes.

Time has passed since we last discussed upcoming new structures (Fanfest 2015 and shortly thereafter), which we have spent reading feedback and iterating on concepts. More importantly we have been busy coming up with more detailed answers on the following two questions, which are the most heated topics you wish to see explained regarding this specific feature: * How exactly am I going to attack, or protect, one of those new structures? * What happens to my stuff if one of those structures has been attacked? We now have a refined version of how those systems are going to work and are ready to share them with you. However, to avoid heart attacks, eye gouging or bleach drinking we are going to focus this blog on answering point 1, while another blog is to follow on point 2. For all the math wizards, min-maxers extraordinaire, and OCD freaks out there, numbers will be provided, but please remember those arent final and will most likely change based on player feedback, testing and various iterations. **Missed a structure blog? Have a look at the following:** * [Back into the structure](URL - Blog introducing the structure changes and long term plan. * [Shake my Citadel](URL - Blog listing the first structure class to be worked on, as well as general mechanics. * [I feel safe in Citadel city](URL - Blog outlining theasset safety mechanics once a Citadel got destroyed. * [CSM Citadel FAQ](URL - A detailed FAQ covering all important aspects of the new structures. Compiled by the CSM in conjunction with CCP. Available in English only. #Capture process# As mentioned in *Shake my Citadel*, new structures are going to use mechanics similar to the revamped Sovereignty system, with a twist to fit our own needs. This naturally implies vulnerable and reinforced states. All Citadels, no matter their size, will have 3 vulnerability windows. They are supposed to be the safest structures around, and thus provide the longest defense buffer available to owners. Please note this will not be true of all structures. Observatory arrays may have only 2 for example, since they are supposed to be more fragile. Also, there will be no Command Node spawning under this system CSM feedback showed it was quite counter-intuitive to fit big guns to your massive structure only to have the fight take place somewhere else. **With the chart below, we are going to go into details how each phase is going to work.** [image](URL #Deployment# All structures will have a deployment time, which will vary depending on the structure size and type. The larger or more impact on the surrounding the structure has, the more time is going to be needed in an effort to give various parties more time to react. A new structure that is being deployed is totally vulnerable to entosis links, and any third party can come to disrupt it *(for high-security space however, a war declaration is required not to suffer the wrath of CONCORD)*. The exact details on the attack process are explained under the entosis link contest below. **Current numbers to deploy Citadels, our first batch of structures, are:** | | **M** | **L** | **XL** | |:-|:-|:-|:-| | **Citadel deployment timer** | 1 hour| 2 hours| 4 hours| Please note those do not require downtime to proceed, unlike existing outposts. It is also important to remember that scooping a structure will cause an immediate and full vulnerability window to begin. If a vulnerability window was already underway, it will refresh the duration to its maximum value. A structure going through a reinforcement timer cannot be scooped until it comes out of it. #Vulnerable 1# A structure that is successfully deployed then enters normal operation mode. Players may use its services, dock, man the defenses or do whatever else is allowed by them. The structure also becomes vulnerable to attack during specific times. **In more details that means:** * Structures may only be attacked by entosis links during their vulnerability windows. * The duration of a vulnerable 1 window is a mandatory timer expressed on a weekly basis, whose length varies depending on the structure size, location and role. * This phase happens periodically while the structure is working normally and has not be set into reinforcement yet. * Players owning the structures set the vulnerability time themselves (if they have enough roles) this can be done in advance, before deploying the structure. * Attacking a structure in high-security space without a war declaration is a bad idea and thus gives you a criminal flag. It is like trying to add pineapples to a pizza *(which is one of the many barbaric traditions a Frenchman must endure in Iceland)*. How players assign weekly vulnerability hours is entirely up to them, as long as they fill the quota. You could assign all hours consecutively if you dispose of enough manpower, or you could spread them out over multiple days. Hours have to be spent whole however, no weird split minute shenanigan is allowed. **Example 1:** * Soft Croissant Incorporated is a small 5 man corporation having a Citadel L structure in high security space with a 6 hours of weekly vulnerability window. Not being a hardcore gamer, the structure owner decides to set the vulnerability window 2 hours during Tuesday evening and 4 hours on Saturday. [image](URL **Example 2:** * The Alluring Baguette Syndicate is a large alliance that just deployed a Citadel XL structure in null security space with a 21 hours of weekly vulnerability window *(they have full occupancy and indexes)*. Confident of its manpower and general resources, the structure owner sets the vulnerability window to cover 3 hours each day of the week. [image](URL Current numbers for the weekly vulnerability window are set as follows and varies based on location or occupancy. Those numbers will most likely change with time. | | **M** | **L** | **XL** | |:-|:-|:-|:-| | **High-sec, low-sec, Null-sec with full occupancy** | 3 hours| 6 hours| 21 hours| | **Wormhole space** | 6 hours| 12 hours| 42 hours| | **Null-sec without occupancy** | 12 hours| 24 hours| 84 hours| #Reinforced 1, 2, and 3# Structures that are successfully attacked through entosis links during their vulnerability windows go into an invulnerable mode for a specific amount of time, at the end of which another vulnerability window may occur. * Reinforcement periods exist to pause the assault and give both attacking and defending parties time to prepare for the next phase, especially if they do not operate within the same timezones. * They also serve to give penalties to the structure owner. A structure entering its first reinforcement window cannot have its fittings altered players will still be able to refuel its various bays, fit ammunition to the various defense systems or take items in or out of its hangars, but will unable to add, remove or change fitted structure modules in any way. A structure entering its second reinforcement window will cause all industry jobs to be paused and services to go offline on top of the previous penalty. Those penalties will exist until the structure goes back into its normal operation mode *"

The attackers get a change of pace and a satisfying pop/killmail, the defenders can switch their ships into full combat mode and have a good old brawl instead of worrying about spacewands, with the timer being actual structure instead of the funky entosis tug of war icon. Attackers win, pop as usual, defenders win, structure auto-repairs before the next vulnerability timer since station repping is cancer. Also dreads would still be relevant, but more to the point, it'd just shake things up in Entosis-land since we're already, and will for the future, use the bloody things for everything. "

Story* I spent some time last week going through various sources, Reddit, feedback threads on Imperium Coalition comms started by Reagalan and Endie, feedback given to me personally or within my alliance. As I did, definite patterns emerged. This doesnt purport to be a complete survey of every complaint or comment about ShinyPixieLaserSov, but I think it summons up the most common and pressing issues. Ill be injecting some of my own opinions into this, but Ill try to clearly mark them off against the feedback. Ill also credit Jayne Fillion for helping formulate and focus some of the issues presented here. **I.** **Specific Issues with Current Gameplay** * Entosis modules on small, fast ships, and particularly interceptors, allow for a high degree of trolling by aggressors, without any commitment of forces. Nullification is particularly problematic because it allows them to travel to their destination with little chance of being stopped, and renders borders extremely permeable to hostiles. This forces an asymmetrical defensive obligation onto the sov holder, who has to spend hours indexing such systems, and frequently hours on entosis timers. Commonly Suggested Solutions: Several suggested, including entosis links turning off prop mods or rendering a ship immobile, but remote repairable, thus both forcing fights if the attacker wants to proceed and allowing the ship to be properly defended. Alternatively restriction of links to certain ship types, such as battlecruiser or above. The mechanics of entosis should encourage fights on a grid for superiority, not trolling or kiting mechanics. My Solution: I believe that entosis links should somehow limit speed via some method, or be limited to slower ships (I am agnostic as to which). I strongly feel that whatever option is chosen should eliminate entosis on nullified ships, and *perhaps* prohibit fitting a cloak. This puts skin in the game for the attacker and means that entosis becomes a matter of grid control, and not simple trolling. * Frequently, aggressors have not made any effort to follow up on their attacks, presumably because they were intended to troll for effect and require a response from the sovholder. This leads to burnout, and frequently, systems will remain uncontested by either side for days or weeks. Sovholders should not have to respond to false threats, or an attacker who is not willing to commit to a fight. Simple griefing of this nature will lead to sovholder burnout and lack of desire for sov. Commonly Suggested Solution: Decay of nodes to a safe state for defender after the end of the scheduled vulnerability window. Several hours should be sufficient for a serious attacker to press their attack. My Solution: Yep, im in favor of some method of node decay. Im willing to discuss length, but there are an awful lot of systems where no one is bothering to contest right now. The onus should be on the attacker to press their attack if they really want the system. * The nodes are excessive in number and spawn very slowly. In the event where no one contests a timer, resetting or saving the system still takes an unreasonable amount of time. The few contested fights have been lengthy, and have not received positive reviews, as they were limited largely to interceptor solo fights. Most fights, as discussed, were uncontested. Commonly Suggested Solution: Reduce the number of nodes required for victory, either as an absolute, or linked with index so that heavily used systems require fewer. Spawn all or most of the nodes close to the beginning of the fight so that redeeming a system where the attacker fails to show up is quicker and more painless. If either the defender or the attacker is in position and ready at the beginning of an event, they should be rewarded for their diligence. My Solution: Ive actually sort of fallen in love with the tennis match solution some folks have been pushing on Reddit, and that was discussed on the Metashow this weekend. Basically first to 5, win by 2. I think it would work really well in this context. * Vulnerability windows every day turn sovereignty into an unpleasant job, even for large alliances. The windows diminish or eliminate opportunities for play outside their own sovereign territory because leaving their space leaves them instantly vulnerable to attack. This problem is exacerbated when the entity is smaller. The vulnerability timers are intended by design to be during their prime time. Smaller entities will likely have one major time zone. Thus, the members must reside in its space during the entirety of their usual online time. This will be a larger problem in lowsec and wormholes entities for structures particularly due to their generally smaller size. Commonly Suggested Solution: Reducing the lengths of the vulnerability windows significantly for higher indexes, so that you rapidly gain a greatly reduced window at ADMs higher than approximately 2.0, the basic ADM at strategic index 5 with no other indexes. Additionally the entosis of station services outside of the alliance window has proven to be an annoyance rather than a content enhancement, that leads only to griefing, particularly for smaller entities. It should be removed and folded into the vulnerability window. My Solution:**I strongly believe that the new vulnerability system included in the Structure blogs should be pushed to ALL sov structures ASAP** . It allows alliances to create the space they need to take a day or two off and go cause trouble in someone elses space, thus increasing the potential for conflict. If all of us with similar TZ windows are stuck defending our sovereignty at the same time, the only people left to conflict with are the occasional roams or trolls. * Currently, if a structure is partially hacked, but the attacker then leaves or is chased off, it remains vulnerable past the scheduled window, unless someone flies there and manually fixes it. This mechanic, like others in this system, places burdens on defenders without requiring input from attackers. Commonly Suggested Solution: When the vulnerability window closes, reset the structure to a fully defended state, and make it invulnerable, unless there is an active link on it at the time. My Solution: That, pretty much. * Activities carried out by sovereign entities are not captured by the indexes, and the entities are required to engage in two of what are widely considered the most boring activities in the game, ratting and mining, in order to defend their space, rather than taking into account manufacturing, refining, research, market orders, PI, PVP kills and other activities that legitimately represent activity. Commonly Suggested Solution: Find ways in the near future to capture these activities significantly within the indexes. My Solution: Again is perfectly in tune with the most commonly suggested one. I will give credit to CCP here and point out that they have acknowledged this issue, and stated they will iterate on it. Its not easy, some of these are pretty gameable unless the approach is careful. * Under the current mechanics, it is currently impossible to offline or unanchor both the TCU and the IHUB. Additionally, it is currently impossible to remove, destroy, or deactivate upgrades. This prevents the transfer of sovereignty between entities. Commonly Suggested Solution: Implement these mechanics as soon as possible. My Solution: This really needs to happen as soon as possible, please. "

I have some advice for you.... there is a bunch of sov that just opened up in catch.... go take it.... also.... enjoy dropping 4B+ on an ihub+upgrades, and 40m+ on an TCU.... Then you get the joy of sitting back and watching it all get blown away by a fleet of Assault frigs with a mix of destroyers. Also.... look forward to defending a 17hr vulnerability window right off the bat because levels don't transfer with sov you get the joy of grinding it all back up.... My two cents: This sov crap was released backasswards the new sov should have been released over a period of 2-3 years with lots of testing long before release Super/Titan changes &gt;&gt; This should have been introduced first long before jump changes, these ships are that which caries sov defense. Having the bigger stick is the best deterrent and anyone who Complains about this is mad cause they got a small stick.... pun intended Introduce new structures &gt;&gt; This should have followed capital changes... let the players get used to this system and changes... Phase out POS/Outpost BPOS &gt;&gt; this is a no brainier, once people get used to the new structures remove the ability to create more of the old. Lock New outpost construction &gt;&gt; This is the first tipping point and test... give people time to build the ones that have already been bought and paid for, after this point has been crossed it all becomes a new collectors item in eve. Phase out Player owned starbases &gt;&gt; This can be done simply.... Remove the ability to anchor new pos'es. Then if a POS goes offline for more then 36 hours.... it gets deleted at downtime. over time there will be fewer and fewer POS's left in the game.... Eventually POS's like outpost will become a collectors item and horded as such. POS killmails will become all the rage for a while.... Sov Changes &gt;&gt; Ok now this is the real raw part of the deal, the new sov system has promise. As it is currently implemented i see several Giant glaring problem with this... how in the world does an entosis link destroy a structure. Destruction should be up to the victor. I should be able to capture a structure or choose to pew it down without the benefits of timers once i have ""Won"". If eve is a sandbox, why should i be forced to destroy something i went through all the work of capturing... thousands of timers and hours of aggravated boredom later and all i get is a Dank killmail, some frosty corpses and some minerals... that i then have to be able to harvest/transport out blah blah blah.... really really.... w/e Then the capture process is the same as a game of whack a mole.... for six hours or more... especially if its hotly contested... take a look at catch in dotlan if you want to see what a region on fire looks like. its been on fire ever since... Dear CCP, I know you want to force players to conform to your vision of eve... however take this advice from an MMO veteran... The we reason play eve instead of any number of other games out there is the sandbox, give us the tools, then let us build our sand castle our way. Let Code./wardecers gank in highsec, let low sec pirates complain all day about null sec empires and highsec carebears, and let nullbears dream about building empires and live in fear of/lookfarward too visits from wormholers.... wormhollers yall keep doing what you are doin you add spice to the game that gives it that complex flavor that we all enjoy.

218,vulnerability,Eve,Why monthly patch releases have backfired and why you should care about it. #firefozzie,14,3ic4lz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3ic4lz/why_monthly_patch_releases_have_backfired_and_why/,2015-08-26 00:24:49,"Hi, i'm writing this and spilling my guts here because I believe the fastest way to get things fixed is to have the playerbase screaming for changes in unison. I've noticed a lot of lowsec/highsec players taking this opportunity to vent all their frustrations about the perceived cowardice of nullsec inhabitants and supporting CCP's recent 'punishments' in what seems to be a spiteful manner. I get it, any system will eventually reach a mostly stagnant state when the great powers settle into their seats. It's frustrating for line members and onlookers to watch diplomacy rule, and invasions halted by backroom deals. After the time i've spent on the peripheries of bloc wars, I gained an understanding in why these wars have been so rare. There's certainly an element of comradery and mutual respect between the big FCs and leaders, which makes them unwilling to suddenly declare war and make the first move. There has been many informal understandings and agreements which lead to playfighting and fake wars, which are embittering if you can see behind the curtain. However, there's more at play than just diplomacy. It takes a tremendous amount of time and effort to lead a war, logistically, in combat, and from a leadership perspective it is a lot of strain to put an alliance under. Any cracks within your group will widen. The number of people willing and able to lead wars steadily drops as experienced FCs lose interest. **The snowglobe of Eve Online will always tend towards stagnation and needs to be shaken up occasionally by CCP in such a manner as to encourage conflict**. At the same time, players need to appreciate the amount of effort that wars demand from leaders and FCs. If you take into account that all these people know each other and are not going to backstab each other for no reason but to risk their own destruction, you should be able to understand why serious conflicts in Dominion were pretty rare. With all that said, I hope you all can read this post with an open mind to understand my perspective here. As we're approach another barren release, consisting of minor bug fixes, database changes and new skins, it's a good time to examine the problems caused by releasing half a patch at a time. Due to the lack of pre-release testing and iteration, we are forced to beta-test half-baked features on the live server. Eve players end up dealing with serious bugs and design flaws for weeks and months before they are addressed or acknowledged. I know some of you are thinking that i'm being unreasonable, so i'd like to point out that Aegis was tested for weeks during the duality competition which provided a perfect chance to gather feedback and to iterate on the system before release. This opportunity to launch Aegis in an enjoyable state was squandered and the roughest edges of fozziesov made it all the way onto the live server unaltered for some reason. Phoebe is up to 10 months without any iteration which is incredible. Maybe they were waiting to see how Aegis played out under current mechanics if you want but that seems like a very weak excuse to me. A degree of live testing is unavoidable, but most of the Aegis problems would have been solved with some rudimentary bug-chasing and quality control. Troll-ceptors are the most fitting example of this, since that's an issue which was raised at the initial presentation of the concept and discussed as a potential exploit since then. Yet we put up with them on the live server for 4 weeks before something resembling a fast and dirty band-aid is applied? I find this indefensible when it is so easily prevented. I'd like to start by listing the most obvious flaws of the Aegis sovereignty system; things which should not have made it past any testing whatsoever. It's sometimes difficult to separate the design decisions from technical limitations, so i'm not going to try and make that distinction and instead simply list all the major problems I can think of in no particular order so here we go: * Partially contested nodes remain capturable until defenders reset them individually, completely ignoring vulnerability timers. (this is a game-breaking exploit). * Lack of node decay, requiring defenders to tediously 'reset' systems even when attackers do not contest the timer. * Lack of node momentum, which would allow uncontested timers to be resolved faster. (under Dominion, uncontested timers would often be blitzed safely using capitals since hostiles were not formed). * Slowly spawning nodes which punished people for turning up on time, further discouraging fleet content. * No killmails for structures. * No attacker details in the notifications for structures. 'partly' due to technical limitations according to CCP Masterplan.. * Lost the ability to transfer, offline and unanchor structures. (why?) * Failing to pay bills causes structures to spontaneously explode, probably related to above point. (Maybe bug / technical limitation). * Lack of risk required or encouraged. (Capitals accomplish less than interceptors). Now i'd like to go over some quality-of-life improvements which should have been released alongside such a punishing patch for sovholders, to encourage conflict and make sovereignty more bearable/rewarding when you are able to defend it. This would have helped to offset the current situation where neither attackers or defenders care about the objectives: * It's still not possible to offline or remove IHUB upgrades. When combined with the lack of ability to offline IHUBs, along with IHUBs exploding if you don't pay your bills, this presents an even bigger problem than before. * Strategic indexes do not suit the come-and-go nature of Aegis sovereignty. Holding a system for 35 days to install a jump bridge/jammer is infeasible and unrealistic. Combined with fatigue this has rendered jump bridges even less of a benefit than before. * The cost of IHUBs and upgrades are too expensive considering how easy they are to destroy now. * Industrial index is determined entirely by ore mined, which is not a true representation of industrial activity. * All anchored sov structures EXPLODED on patch day, forcing sovholders to run around scooping them all before the patch hit (again, why?) **In conclusion, Aegis feels like a square peg forced into a round hole**. Older Dominion mechanics now make very little sense combined with fozziesov. Many aspects of Dominion have been appropriated into the new system with no thought put into how to integrate them with new mechanics and how well they mesh. Over time, most of my points will be addressed eventually, the 'expansion' today is taking some baby-steps towards a less torturous system. The question is really whether a few baby-steps every month is enough. **Is sovereignty the ishtar? Can Eve wait another year for it to be fixed?** I can't imagine what state nullsec will be in a year from now at this rate. Are Eve players are happy to wait a few more months for sovereignty to even become a tolerable experience? I'm not even thinking about new structures and fun, compelling reasons to hold sovereignty, just for the existing mechanics to be blended with a little more thought and care than pushing them together and hope the players don't notice. For some anecdotal experience: Before patch day, I had to fly around scooping up all defensive SBUs and anchored structures before they exploded which raises a few questions. Why couldn't they have just remained anchored after the patch and allowed people to unanchor them at their own pace? This screams 'technical limitation' to me. If they really had to explode, why not reimburse corp wallets directly and save us the effort? Then the patch hit, and all our systems were being reinforced by PL and NC who we had no chance of engaging. I learned that nodes never expired, and that it took 10x the effort to defend our systems than it took to reinforce them. We had no motivation to chase around interceptors and t3 destroyers 18 hours a day. I knew this would be a problem before the patch hit, but I couldn't have known quite how bad this system would be on release. 'Okay' I thought, 'I guess i'll just go scoop all these IHUBs and drop our sov'. Then I discovered it was no longer possible to offline or unanchor structures. I was shocked and annoyed that Aegis was allowed to launch in this state. Our only options were to stop paying bills and wait for our structures to EXPLODE, or wait for the systems to be taken from us. We were essentially left holding a bottle full of piss with hundreds of tiny holes in it. I tried to unscrew the cap but it was melted on so that we just had to watch the piss leaking out of the bottle all over the carpet. I interpreted the removal of these features as a giant 'fuck you' to all current sov-holders, with no possible justification or upsides. The only explanation I have is that Aegis sovereignty is so poorly coded that they had to sweep many aspects of it under the rug to maintain the illusion that it works as intended. Finally I have a few links with some quotes from CCP: * Fozzie on 'game mechanics he thinks he understands': URL Try this one at home kids. * Fozzie on 'why band-aids are the solution to everything': URL Working as intended. * CCP Masterplan on 'why entosis notifications don't tell you anything': URL 'We encountered technical difficulties implementing this. Then we decided it wasn't worth doing anyway'. **It makes more sense to unsubscribe than cut yourself on the sharp edges of Aegis and Phoebe, and CCP needs to acknowledge the drawbacks of implementing half a system at a time. I would rather have a finished product than have it dismantled and rebuilt piece by piece.** URL #hirefozzie @riot"
219,vulnerability,Eve,Tales of a pilot,36,3ih6xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3ih6xk/tales_of_a_pilot/,2015-08-27 01:30:40,"Drifting into conciousness I awoke on my bunk in the captains quarters to the dull boop of my terminal, the stale recirculated air felt warm and moister than usual on my cheeks, probably another burst pipe in atmospherics... Damn Minmatar stations, there was always something breaking, its a wonder something this big even stays in one piece. The boop sounds again, stealing the attention from my thoughts, getting up and throwing on my flight suit from the day before I stumble over to check the alert, flashing in the corner is the new mail notification, taping the icon I see the title ""The Goonies Are Coming...For Reals This Time"". Pondering this, my mind drifts off to old news of Imperium engagements when they were still called CFC, massive fleets, massive explosions, massive bills. The image of thousands of pilots bearing down on the region I call home fills me with a mix of dread and excitement, dread for the sheer numbers that are coming and what they could do, excitement for what it will bring, more fights and more lone pilots for me to engage. The general rumour floating around the spacenet was that they were bringing trollceptors (interceptors with entosis links) that could move fast and warp faster. Hard to counter without specific ships and fits. My eyes wander onto the Sentinel class electronic attack frigate sat at the berth outside my quarters, its symmetrical hull pleasing my eyes. It was a beast of a ship, and for killing interceptors it was amazing. 216Gj/5s of pure neuting power with 108dps, enough to stop any frigate in its tracks. A klaxon goes off somewhere overhead and another alert appears on my terminal, Goons had been spotted in the local constellation, and were entosising station services, the alliances vulnerability window wasn't for another 3 hours, so deciding it is time to get into space, I start the slow walk to the berth where my capsule and its warm embrace await. I would run, but my legs wont respond properly, it has been this way for 4 years since a mandatory firmware update to the neural link had been performed. Reaching the end of the causeway, I begin the descent to the capsule station beneath my ship, stepping into its shadow the memories of the last time I was podded and the loss of my carrier come flooding back. I chuckle at the thought, the pilot who had killed my first battleship 3 years ago had also been involved in the carrier kill, and filled me with a moment of nostalgia. Both for the carrier and the journey since the battleship loss. As I step into the capsule, its door sliding shut and locking with a click of maglocks, I feel the tendrils of the Neural bridge linking with my spine, each new link causing a twitch in different muscles, then as they finally lock in place the goo starts rising from the bottom, till it is at my chin then up and over my head till the capsule is completely full. I take a breath of fluid and my lungs cry out at the liquid, I take no notice, the fluid is oxygen rich enough to sustain me. Then gravity and blackness take hold as the pod is lifted up and into the belly of the ship, a hiss whispers into the pod through the goo as it locks in place and bulkheads slam shut behind it. I will the ship to undock and it is kicked out into space, I feel the coldness of space upon the hull and hear the sing of the solar winds, this is what it was all about, freedom and beauty. Engaging the warp drive to the nearest gate and set it to auto-jump. I arrive in the next system, its sun a blue ball of fire in the centre, a nice change from the dark red of my home. There are reds in local and my adrenaline spikes, I spot one warping off towards station and follow hoping that my ship can keep up. However once I arrive the grid is empty, he must have warped to a celestial nearby. Deciding to warp back to the gate I came through I warp back at 100km and see there is now 10 red Goon interceptors on the gate, my pulse spikes again as 2 of them burn towards me, I align back to station and engage my micro warp drive hoping to keep them drawn out. They keep closing... 50km... 40km... 30km... I look up the closest ship, a Stiletto class interceptor and engage neuts, his speed starts to drop as his MWD offlines and realspace pulls on his craft, I drop drones as I start to take damage from his fleet mates their ammunition exploding against the shields, my drones fly off to engage the Stiletto as I lock up the next ship, a Slasher class frigate, a baby version of the Stiletto. A shrill whine breaks through the sounds as my shields dissipate and I start to take armour damage. My ancillary armor repair activates, pouring nanites into the cracks appearing in my armor, going back and fourth between 65-100% as the cycles complete and run again, I register an explosion, I had almost been too engaged in keeping my armour at a good % to notice the Stiletto going down. I engage everything on the Slasher, and he starts taking hits. My armor dropping lower and lower now as each cycle starts and reinforcements arrive on grid, another alarm, scrammed, my MWD shuts down as its core becomes unstable. Slowing I feel the reinforcements bearing down on me with incredible speed, and more guns add to the cacophony of fire. More alarms and I am taking hull damage, the armour protecting me getting thinner and thinner. Light from the sun begins to shine through cracks and is visible on the internal CCTV, feeling moments of panic I try to disengage, but I am too far down the rabbit hole, ships surround me as the Slasher's reactor breaches and creates a 2nd sun for a split second before slagging the frigate into a wreck. I check my hull for damage, as splinters of metal and components start pinging off of the outside of the capsule. A loud shunting noise is heard as my pod shoots out into the void and a rumble as the pressure wave from my ships own reactor goes critical, then silence. I will my pod to warp before it can be locked and I manage to escape the jaws of death. Warping to the station in system I hope there is a bar, I need a pint. Tl:Dr: Fought goons 1v20 got 2 kills. Good times."
220,vulnerability,Eve,[Dev Blog] Summer of Sov - Transition and Deployment ~CCP Fozzie,30,3cfmsc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3cfmsc/dev_blog_summer_of_sov_transition_and_deployment/,2015-07-08 01:19:29,"URL [image](URL Hello dauntless capsuleers! This is CCP Fozzie bringing you another dev blog about the big sovereignty capture changes coming on July 14^th. Here in CCPs Reykjavik offices were hard at work tweaking and polishing the new system for release, and we cant wait to roll it out for all of you soon. This is the fourth major dev blog providing information about the Summer of Sov, and you can expect two more after this, one covering some hitherto secret changes and another summarizing the whole system so that people dont need to dig through five other blogs to get all the information. * [Politics by Other Means](URL * [Summer 2015 Nullsec and Sov Status Report](URL * [New Details on July Sovereignty Release Schedule](URL * This blog! * Blog covering details on changes to **REDACTED** . * Final blog summarizing the new capture system in one place. Todays blog will be a bit of an information dump, covering quite a few topics related to the new system and its rollout to the Tranquility server. * Transition: What to expect on patch day * Capital system details * More details on structure launching and capture * CREST and API details for third party tools * Duality testing and the results of the playtest competition ##**What to expect on patch day** ## With the July 14^th deployment date of the new sov capture system fast approaching, its important that everyone be aware of how the transition from the old system to the new one will play out. Since the basic functions of TCUs, IHubs and Stations are remaining constant, the transition for most of these structures will be fairly straightforward. We are endeavoring to cause as small of a disruption as possible to any sovereignty conflicts that may be in progress on patch day. ###**Sovereignty Blockade Units** ### SBUs do not play a role in the new system, and will begin to be phased out this month. During the patch downtime all SBUs in space will be destroyed, and SBU blueprints will be rendered inert. Any new SBUs launched into space after patch day will explode one minute after appearing in space. At the same time, we will begin the process of phasing out SBUs and their blueprints from the game. NPC buy orders will appear for SBUs and un-researched SBU blueprints so that players can choose to recoup some of the value of their SBU stock at their own pace. After a few months of voluntary buyback we plan to convert all SBUs to TCUs, SBU blueprints to TCU blueprints, and remove the legacy market entries for these types. ###**Excess Territorial Claim Units and Infrastructure Hubs in Space** ### Under the new system, only one TCU and one IHub will be allowed in space per system. As part of this transition, on the patch downtime any TCU or IHub that is in space but not in an online state will be destroyed. This will ensure that only one TCU and one IHub per system will remain. We advise all Alliances to ensure that their IHubs are online before the release downtime on the 14^th. ###**Structures that are reinforced or vulnerable as the patch downtime begins** ### In order to prevent unnecessary confusion and complication on patch day, all Infrastructure Hubs, Stations and TCUs that are in reinforced, vulnerable and/or damaged states will be reset to full health and full owner control over the patch downtime. This means that a sov structure that has a reinforcement period straddling the patch downtime will no longer be reinforced after the patch deployment is completed. If the structures normal vulnerability period (as determined by the combination of your Alliances vulnerability timer and the systems Activity Defense Multiplier) extends over the time of the server startup, the structure will begin in a vulnerable state with 100% control by its owning alliance. Otherwise the structure will begin in a secure state and become vulnerable at the beginning of its next vulnerability period. Any stations that are owned by corporations outside of an Alliance during the patch downtime will immediately enter a Freeport reinforcement period for approximately 48 hours from the server startup point. In order to keep the disruption for ongoing sovereignty warfare to a minimum, we are not currently planning any other sov invulnerability period after the patch (beyond the one time removal of reinforcement states over the patch downtime). ##**Capital Systems** ## ###**Quick Capital selection for the first two days after release** ### Starting immediately after the July 14^th downtime, Alliances will be able to designate one of their systems as an Alliance Capital. In order to allow Alliances to gain the benefits of their capital quickly after deployment, we plan to make all capital system selection and changes apply very quickly (as close to instantly as possible given server limits) for the first two days after deployment. This means that between downtime on July 14^th and downtime on July 16^th Alliances will be able to set their capitals and change it as often as desired with no waiting period. Once downtime on July 16^th has passed, changes to Capital system settings will require 7 days to take effect. ###**Single system Alliance Capitals** ### The one exception to the 7 day waiting period for Capital systems is that anytime an Alliance only has Sovereignty over one star system (as determined by TCUs) that one system will automatically become the Alliance capital. This means that Alliances taking their first system will not need to wait a week to gain the benefits of the Capital system defensive bonuses. It also ensures that when an Alliance is pushed to a final stand in its last system, that system will always gain the capital defensive benefits. Any other changes to Capital systems will always require 7 days in order to take effect. This includes cases where an Alliance that controls multiple systems has lost its previous capital and is setting a new one. ##**Alliance Vulnerability Timer Settings** ## As many of you already know, the ability to set your Alliance default vulnerability timer has been available in game since the [Carnyx release](URL on June 2^nd. So far this setting has only pre-loaded the value in the database in preparation for the next Sov release, but on July 14^th it will begin applying to all Sovereignty structures belonging to your alliance. This means *it is very important for every sov-holding alliance to choose an appropriate vulnerability timer before the 14^th to ensure that their structures match their alliances primary time zone.* The setting can be found on Tranquility right now within the Corporation window, Alliances tab, and Home subtab. Characters with director roles in the Alliance executor corporation can edit the vulnerability timer by clicking on the cogwheel on the right. The image below displays where this setting can be accessed. [image](URL Sovereignty structures belonging to Alliances that have not chosen a default vulnerability timer will have their vulnerability windows automatically centered on 11:00 EVE Time (downtime). ##**Sov Structure Deployment Process** ## For those players who have not yet had a chance to try out the new system on the Duality test server, we also want to go over some of the details around deploying structures in the new system. This information can also be found in the show-info window for the Sov structures, but we want to make sure the maximum number of people see it. "
221,vulnerability,Eve,FozzieSov jump bridges,37,3csbi8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3csbi8/fozziesov_jump_bridges/,2015-07-10 21:07:08,"As a providence resident, Jump Bridges are an important part of moving around our coalition space, and as a result, many different sov holders hold strategic systems to maximise jump bridge efficiency. Under fozziesov, these 'strategic' systems are going to be difficult to hold, if not impossible. From the perspective of someone living in the 'core' systems of a group, a faraway system which we only hold for a jump bridge is now going to be undesirable to live in, and remote. People aren't going to want to accumulate fatigue jumping several times in their vulnerability window to defend a system that they have to gate through many systems, and if the indices of that system are low (because noone wants to live there because it's cut off from their main base of operations), the response time of a group via gates may not really be sufficient either. So the big question is, where does that leave jump bridges under fozziesov? Will we see a lot more 'short hop' JBs that only span a couple of jumps to stop choke points and help in constellation warfare, or will these strategic systems still be held as they currently are? Will jump bridges become pointless when (if!) each sovereign group only has a few systems to protect? Will they be worth the setup and maintenance costs? Will Feawen like this?"

Please see the following series of dev blogs for further details: * [Politics by Other Means](URL * [Summer 2015 Nullsec and Sov Status Report](URL * [New Details on July Sovereignty Release Schedule](URL * [Sovereignty Transition and Deployment](URL * [Nullsec PVE and upgrades](URL * Territorial Claim Units, Infrastructure Hubs, and Outposts are no longer subject to regular weapons damage. Instead an Entosis Link module is required to capture and control them. * Ownership of Territorial Claim Units, Infrastructure Hubs, and Outposts has now been decoupled from one-another. Each different structure in a solar system can be deployed, owned, attacked and destroyed by different alliances at the same time. * Territorial Claim Units no longer require an upkeep bill. Instead, the running costs have been moved over to bills onInfrastructure Hubs. * Each alliance can set a Default Vulnerability Time for their sovereignty structures. This is a daily interval where structures will become vulnerable to Entosis Links. The length of this interval is based on the Activity Defense Multiplier. The ADM in turn is based on the Strategic, Military and Industrial levels of the solar system. Changes to the Default Vulnerability Time will take 48 hours to come in to effect. * Each alliance can set a single Capital System on one solar system where they control aTerritorial Claim Unit. Structures controlled by an alliance in their Capital System receive a bonus to their ADM, making them easier to defend. Changes to the Capital System will take 7 days to come in to effect. * Destroying/capturing another alliance's sovereignty structures requires attackers to use Entosis Links on the structure during its daily vulnerability window. If this action succeeds, the structure will become invulnerable. At some some point between 24 and 72 hours later, Command Nodes will begin spawning around the constellation. Attackers and defenders must capture these nodes using Entosis Links in a tug-of-war battle in order to destroy/secure the structure. * Sovereignty Blockade Units are now obsolete. Any SBUs in space will automatically self-destruct, whilst SBUs in hangars can be sold back to NPC buy orders. ###Exploration:### * The effects of Pirate Detection Array, Entrapment Array, Survey Networks and Quantum Flux Generator infrastructure upgrades have been adjusted. See[this dev blog](URL more details. * Nullsec and Lowsec versions of the Assault, Headquarters and Mothership Incursion sites now allow 50% more players before rewards begin to decrease. ###**SKIN:** ### Added ship SKINs for Tech 2 Cruisers and Tech 2 Industrials. They are the following: * AMARR* Sacrilege EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Zealot EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Devoter EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Guardian EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Curse EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Pilgrim EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Augoror Navy Issue EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Omen Navy Issue EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Prorator EoM SKIN (Permanent) * Impel EoM SKIN (Permanent) * CALDARI* Cerberus Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Eagle Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Onyx Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Basilisk Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Falcon Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Rook Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Caracal Navy Issue Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Osprey Navy Issue Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Crane Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * Bustard Wiyrkomi SKIN (Permanent) * GALLENTE* Deimos Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Ishtar Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Phobos Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Oneiros Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Arazu Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Lachesis Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Exequror Navy Issue Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Vexor Navy Issue Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Viator Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * Occator Intaki Syndicate SKIN (Permanent) * MINMATAR* Muninn Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Vagabond Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Broadsword Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Scimitar Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Huginn Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Rapier Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Scythe Fleet Issue Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Stabber Fleet Issue Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Prowler Justice SKIN (Permanent) * Mastodon Justice SKIN (Permanent) ###User Interface:### * New map: The circular cursor has been removed * New map: The map can now follow markers, including your current location. #Fixes:# ###PvE:### * Certain hacking containers that were supposed to spawn items in your ships cargo were not functioning correctly. ###User Interface:### * Fixed an issue that caused bilingual clients to not display content correctly. #**Third Party Development:** # ###CREST API:### * New endpoints are available in support of the new sovereignty system:[API changes for Aegis sovereignty](URL "
223,vulnerability,Eve,[EVE News] Important! Issue with sovereignty vulnerability timers ~CCP Falcon,28,3dftkz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/3dftkz/eve_news_important_issue_with_sovereignty/,2015-07-16 08:56:24,"URL An issue has been found that can cause sovereignty structures to immediately re-enter vulnerability after defenders win their capture event. The intended behavior in this situation would be for the structure to become secure until the beginning next days vulnerability period if the defenders win the capture event. There is a fix for this issue that will be deployed at downtime tomorrow, July 16^th. This particular issue is unrelated to the extended downtime on July 15^th. Since some sovereignty structures will be exiting their reinforcement period before downtime tomorrow, we will be taking steps to ensure that this issue does not impact these particular structures. These actions will only be needed if the following criteria are all met: * The defenders win the capture event at the end of the reinforcement period * The defender victory takes place before downtime on July 16^th * After the capture event completes, attackers reinforce the structure again during the same daily vulnerability period that the capture event took place within The structures that could potentially need intervention are: * The Station in B-DBYQ * The IHub in LXQ2-T * The TCU in 9-8GBA * The TCU in Q-HJ97 * The IHub in KZFV-4 * The TCU in N-CREL * The Station in BI0Y-X * The TCU in J-A5QD * The Station in H-MHWF * The IHub in VVO-R6 * The TCU in XT-R36 * The TCU in VVO-R6 * The TCU in DY-F70 * The TCU in OAQY-M * The Station in AZ3F-N * The TCU in 7X-02R * The TCU in MKD-O8 * The TCU in 2I-520 * The TCU in 5GQ-S9 * The TCU in 4-43BW * The TCU in EOA-ZC * The TCU in E3OI-U * The Freeport in 38IA-E * The Station in LP1M-Q * The TCU in B-5UFY * The Station in TYB-69 * The IHub in TYB-69 * The TCU in FYD-TO * The TCU in 54-MF6 * The Station in KZFV-4 * The TCU in QSM-LM * The IHub in 71-UTX * The TCU in TYB-69 * The TCU in H-MHWF If any of these structures follow the sequence of events listed above completely, CCP will manually cancel the second reinforcement period for those structures and cause them to become secure until the next days vulnerability period. We will not take any action if the attackers win the capture events for these structures, as in that case the mechanics will be working normally. "

The smoothness of Tuesday was good. To good it seems with the main hiccup being [a confusion of sov bills](URL Concord was displaced by the Secure Commerce Commission. No more paying the cops. On Wednesday Eve went down for just under twelve hours while a bug was hunted down and exterminated. [CCP decided to gift the players with skill points](URL for the inconvenience. This surprised me. I'm torn on it. It goes into my pool of reimbursed skillpoints I've managed to gather. I don't think it was necessary. I do know some groups lost their complete play time that day and some players displayed a level of rage that I consider grossly disappointing. I think it was a good move on CCP's part as a company but I'd not have been writing angry posts it if had not happened. This is a wide, sweeping changes and brings with it bugs. Tower anchoring notifications in sovereign space vanishing is a bug. Sion pounced on it quickly and the bug was confirmed and we hope that it will be fixed shortly. [There was an issue with vulnerability timers as well](URL One thing that I have heard questioned is the value of public facing timers. [Timerboard.net](URL is up and active. Like the wormhole mapping programs, it brings information once gathered to the fingers of any interested. It is easy accessibility to what was accessible before with a bit more work. Over in Tweetfleet Slack CCP Nullarbor mentioned the current plans to allow supers to dock in XL Citadels. &gt; [CCP Nullarbor](URL AM](URL talked about this in blogs that we are considering it, and haven't heard any good arguments why we shouldn't do it Last year before the power projection changes were announced, I knew we'd be discussing the future of capitals, supers, and titans quite often. One of the information gathering things I did was to see how people felt about supers and titans being able to dock. It is yet another split field. I've never been fond of the coffin in space and because of that I've never wanted a super. Even if I could dock it I'd not want one now. However, this isn't a potential future that is about me. On the side of keeping things as they are some discuss the 'cost' of maintaining a super. Various aspects of this cost, from dedicated accounts to hoards of cyno alts, often come up. My personal concern is about supers in low sec. They are already a powerful tool and this gives them a bit more flexibility. Yes, I know capitals need to be rebalanced. Yes, I have heard people say that there is now*absolutely100%completelyand utterly zero* use for them in game. Those frustrations do not negate the fact that they are used and being able to dock them will change things.An organization that is housing supers will be able to anchor XL Citadels at pretty much any budget point. I feel that this has a more impact then anchoring a Large POS and housing the super fleet. Other's disagree. I've presented all sides of the argument that I know. It is a big change with a lost of questions and I'd like to thoroughly examine it now. I have been addressing super usage in low sec and common points such as catching supers. At the end of the day for those against it, CCP Nullarbor wants a good argument and 'because it has always been' is not. For those curious: Things I will not ever support for low sec. Bubbles. Bombs. Removing gateguns so that it can be just like null sec with sec hits. How about this jump clone bug? What do you think about it? Like it? Feel devalued? I think its interesting and opens a door to see how players feel about something once hidden behind a barrier like standings being this, casually open. It has already been accessible with the switch of a corporation but a corporation switch even for a reasonable thing such as jump clones is not one made casually by many. This week I did not make the weekly meeting. As always, I can only make it every other week. There was another marketing meeting thrown together at a moments notice which was quite nice but also on a work day. I'll have recordings to catch up with on my days off. As for talking to people. I aim for next weekend, probably Sunday to hang out on coms for chats. I tend to announce in game and on twitter. **"

Answer: Sov. Sov only appeals to you if you are a farmer. What if I don't want to play the farmer? What it I'd prefer to play the Marauder? I don't want your sov, I want to come and take what you've been farming all summer before you harvest it, and I want kill the fleet that you send to try to stop me. Right now, can't. Invulnerable in a station. Sucks to be me. I think that fozzie + phoebe will be ok if they don't get cowardly about the last part - structures. They need to handle it in such a way that accumulated wealth is always at risk. ""Citadels"" and other structures should be destructible, and player built stations should be phased out. The magical un-scannable can thing? Meh, but OK. It gives the loser a chance to, but no guarantee of, retrieving their stuff. NPC Null Stations should be phased out, and replaced with destructible structures. If one gets destroyed, the NPCs will rebuild it eventually. Low-Sec and High-Sec NPC stations should limit how much crap you can keep in them. 10m m3 should be sufficent for newbie players. Want to store more than that, or have a corp or alliance office? Build your own damn station. So, you're a farmer and you are sick of marauders taking your stuff? Get some more farmers together, find out where they're keeping it, and go take it back. I don't think the answer is resource depletion. I think the answer is resource vulnerability. The game needs to support both farmer/empire builders, and marauders. I think that CCP has the right idea. I just hope that they take it far enough, and don't cave to the whiners who will inevitably threaten to rage quit if someone can take their stuff. Bonus Feature: If you're feeling really salty and hardcore, and you don't think the above takes it far enough, start making folks carry their isk in their pod. Kill that guy who has been ratting for 3 hours? Cha-Ching! Sure, people would create banker alts, but, gotta move them sometime. They'd be docked in a destructible station, after all. "
226,vulnerability,Eve,[Dev Blog] New Details on July Sovereignty Release Schedule ~CCP Fozzie,94,383tj9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/383tj9/dev_blog_new_details_on_july_sovereignty_release/,2015-06-02 03:33:37,"URL [image](URL Hello capsuleers! As most of you will already know, we here at CCP are currently in the midst of preparing and releasing a major rebuilding of EVE's Sovereignty capture system. We've released two dev blogs ([here](URL and [here](URL detailing these plans so far, and your feedback and contribution has been invaluable as always. The next part of these changes are being deployed tomorrow in our Carnyx release, when Entosis Links will start being used to enable and disable station services, alliances will be able to pre-set their default vulnerability times and the in-space player activity of a system will begin to be collected in the Activity Defense Multiplier. As we continue to work on implementing and testing more parts of the new system we are continuously updating our plans and schedules to make sure we release the best possible quality as quickly as possible. We also want to keep you all up to date on these updates to the plan. Today we're announcing two changes to our schedule: * We are moving the target date of the next set of major Sovereignty changes back one week to July 14th. This means that they will deploy as a one week follow-up patch to the Aegis release rather than as part of the main deployment. * The ability to set custom vulnerability timers per structure will come in a later release, once we feel it meets the quality level our customers expect. We are still committed to this additional feature as we believe it will get us a stronger and more flexible system. It will be released as soon as it can be fully polished. These updates are part of our commitment to ensuring that this feature has the time to be thoroughly tested internally, with our external testing partners and by the community on our public test servers. It also ensures that we will have enough time to polish the usability of the feature ensure that every player can enjoy the new system. We'll be making full use of the rapid deployment system that CCP Seagull outlined in her recent [dev blog](URL in this process. It's always possible that more changes to the schedule could be made if new information comes to our attention, and as we respond to your feedback both before and after public test server testing begins. If more changes do occur we'll continue keeping you all up to date through the dev blog and community news systems, as well as official social media channels. Full information on release dates is also always available on our [EVE Updates webpage](URL your one stop shop for information on what's coming to EVE. We have more dev blogs planned in the coming month, including one coming soon that will detail the transition plan from the old system to the new system on patch day. We continue to welcome your feedback and we'll be announcing soon when our test server war games will begin to help nullsec alliances try out the new system as well as providing us with more solid testing.

227,vulnerability,Eve,[CSM10] Concerns sent in. ~christopher wall (noreply at blogger.com),2,35l2l4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/35l2l4/csm10_concerns_sent_in_christopher_wall_noreply/,2015-05-11 21:18:17,"URL I recently got mailed in some pretty good questions by Selto Black of The Desolate Order, so figured I'd answer them here as there probably concerns alot have. **** ***What affects do youbelievethe new structures will have on j-space?*** * *I'm hoping it will make life in W-space easier, although there are issues. Trying to balance everything for all different spaces, Isn't going to be easy ***Do you think that the window ofvulnerabilitywill work in j-space?*** This is where it gets tricky, firstly its worth remembering that just because the vulnerability window works one way in sovdoesn'tmean it has to work that way for everything. CCP are building in asmany knobs and buttons so that things can be altered and changed as much as possible as easily as possible. My guess is yes it can work although. I'll be pointing out issues and concerns as we go along I've posted alot of feedback already on the confluence page andas wellraised them in our slack group and toCCP Nullabor, we're hoping to have a meeting soon where we can get some more information about general things to help give us a betteroverallidea of what will be happening. ***What is your view on the new shattered holes?*** If you mean in general I still have some things I don't like, I'm still not a fan of forcing people to go armour in them with the Wolf Rayet effect, although I can see why they did it. If you mean will they allow POS's in there, my guess at the moment would be no. They probably want to keep it how it is. ***How do you feel about Wormholers jumping into null just to entosis station services to provoke fights?*** **** ***How do you feel about Wormholers Reinforcing Null-Sec structures just for the shits and giggles.*** I'll answer both these together I'm not sure these will get fights I can see small groups going out and saying ""hey fight me or we start knocking your services offline"" But the majority of people who don't want to fight will just stay docked and try to put them back on afterwards when noone is around. I think its potentially going to be a griefers paradise. Which has me concerned on some levels. Its one of these thingsthat'snot to much a issue for big groups but will be a huge issue for smaller less organisedgroups. Sadlythat'snearly always the way regardless of changes but this willdefinitelymake it harderfor smaller groups that live in null. Alot of this will depend on just how much people use there space, and how big the vulnerability window is. ***What is your view on the bluebagelrenting out C6 space?*** I don't really like it, sadly its hard to stop, its a player driven issue. Not a mechanical one. I must say I find it funny when Hidden Freman (CEO of lazerhawks) moans there isn't enough pvp in w space when he's part of the blue bagel going around kicking people out. I'm hoping the changes to capital escalations will help in some way although I doubt it will be enough. The other issue is should CCP even do stuff to alter players behavior as its a sandbox after all. I think the only way you can say yes here is if its in the interests of making the game better as a whole. Then it gets subjective on whats best for the game. ***Howwouldyou go about making Poses in Wormholes ""Fair"" (with respect to not being moon locked,How to make them findable without having to reveal that you're there)under Fozzie structures?*** * *With the first part if that happens in W-space, as stuff can change. You have to look at what issues it will cause, the main one being full moon coverage being a defense of system mechanic. When I did all the POS survey last year nearly half of the people who filled them in said they covered all moons. It also wasn't just people in high class wormholes that did this. loads in lower class wormholes did as well. If your going to take that away you need to add something to compensate. If we can't have full coverage we need something else one way would bemaking it so POS are a real force multiplier. They will need teeth and a much better way to affect the battles around them than they do now. On making them findable and I think youdefinitelyneed to be able to find them without revealing that you arethere. Having them appear on the overview tab like stations, is probably the simplest way to do it. another option would be to maybe have some probes you can launch while cloaked that are cloaked as well but can only scan structures. Although that to me personally seems needless complex compared to the first way."
228,vulnerability,Eve,[Dev Blog] Shake my Citadel ~CCP Ytterbium,305,35pu3x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/35pu3x/dev_blog_shake_my_citadel_ccp_ytterbium/,2015-05-13 01:01:24,"URL Hello again dear space friends and welcome back to another structure blog from Team Game of Drones. As we have been riding the Fanfest hype train and gathering feedback from the forums and other communication channels, we decided it was time to bring more details to chew on. So, take a seat by the campfire and grab some marshmallows while we give you some updates on our structure overhaul plans. ##First Structure Type: Citadel class## [image](URL Since the scope of a full structure overhaul is larger than the [Stay Puft Marshmallow Man](URL we had to play smart and focus our efforts into one structure role at a time instead of crossing the streams everywhere. There is difficulty involved in picking which one of those roles to start with. Since the first structure we release is going to require core mechanics to work, like fittings, deployment or even management, we need to make sure the foundation is solid while still delivering an interesting package for players to enjoy. When that is out of the way, it will significantly speed up development time for more advanced structure roles that have their own new mechanics but still require the core gameplay listed above. **You may remember the structure roles from** [**our previous Dev Blog** ](URL being:** * Assembly Arrays * Research Laboratories * Market and Office Hubs * Drilling Platforms * Observatory Arrays * Gates * Administration Hubs * Advertisement Centers We will spare you the endless debates, bartering sessions and casualty reports coming out after locking two dozen EVE developers in various meeting rooms and go straight to the point: we have decided to start with Market and Office Hubs, but with a twist. Since we like giving you a place you can call home and collectively interact with, be it for cooperative or competitive needs, this role is ideal to start with. At the same time we want to achieve much more than just adding a fresh coat of paint on existing structures. We want to develop their use in the EVE universe and develop excitement as a whole. Market and Office Hubs sounds a little bland, like another day at the office dealing with a grumpy boss and an unreliable coffee machine. How about we spice that up a little bit? Of all the structures, we want these to be the most dedicated to asset safety, protection, and a feeling of home just like when you are tucked inside your bed sheets while the elements rage outside. At your coziest you should be fortified in [giant bunkers](URL equipped with [mega death rays](URL to weather the storm. As such, we are slightly changing the purpose of the Market and Office Hubs structures and renaming them Citadels to give a better approximation of what they do (note: I initially wanted to have them called space [chteaux](URL but got rejected by a team full of damn barbarians who dont know what good French taste is). In time they will still retain the other functionality mentioned (Market, corporation offices, cloning, insurance, character customization, Customs Office and potentially Interbus), as we release new service modules. CCP Nag and CCP Maximum Cats have scattered a few concept arts for the Citadel structures within this dev blog for you to feast your eyes upon. As usual, please remember those are still work in progress and may not represent final look. ##Pick on a Bully Your Own Size## [image](URL As mentioned during the [Fanfest presentation](URL and associated Dev Blog, structures are sorted in various shape and sizes. Citadels are no exception. * Medium sized Citadel structures will be around 5-25km in diameter and are tailored for individual or small groups of players. They will be able to fit some appropriate defenses to offer resistance against most kind of assaults including capital ships. Moreover, players can dock inside them with sub-capital ships. * Large sized Citadel structures will be around 25-50km in diameter and are made for corporations or even small alliances. They will offer more advanced functionality over medium-sized Citadels, mainly in the form of area of effect (AoE) defenses and facilities that are more tailored to support large fleets. While players will be able to dock with sub-capitals, capitals are still up to debate at this point. * X-Large sized Citadel structures will be around 100km in diameter and are specialized for high-end alliance gameplay. On top of the mechanics listed above, they will have the best defensive options to face against particularly large groups and allow capital ships to be docked (even maybe supercapitals--to be discussed). Most if not all of those structures will have a replacement for the current Starbase forcefield with the use of the invulnerability link (final name to be discussed), which will ensure safety for friendly ships within a specific radius. This will not cause your ship to stay in space when logging off. **Sizes also determine their release order.** * We will start by focusing on Medium and Large Citadels, since we believe they offer gameplay that extends to most player groups. They also are a lot simpler than X-Large Citadels to design and implement. * When Medium and Large Citadels are out and we have gained some experience through them, we will then deploy the X-Large variation which offer much more challenge in their conception due to their humongous sizes and intended use cases. ##Capture the Flag## [image](URL As mentioned during the last blog, we also have given some more thought on how players will be able to take structures out. Small structures, which are going to assimilate existing deployables, cargo containers and mobile warp disruptors will still be able to be directly shot by players. Some exceptions may be kept around for the time being, like the Mobile Depot having a reinforcement timer on their own. Medium, Large and X-Large structures will use a version of the Sovereignty capture mechanic, which means they will only be attacked through the use of the Entosis module. [Please refer to this blog for more information on how that works](URL and [this blog](URL for an update to those plans for this summers Carnyx and Aegis releases and beyond. **Some details will vary however, as our needs arent exactly identical:** * Unlike existing Outposts, nothing is to prevent us from having the new structures destroyed after a successful Entosis capture. * Those structures will use the same principles of vulnerability and reinforced states from the Sovereignty overhaul. The structure can only be attacked by Entosis modules when it is vulnerable, and is invulnerable when reinforced. The difference between normal and reinforced modes remains that penalties may be applied to the structure in the latter case (like jobs stopping for instance). The number of vulnerable and reinforced states depends on the size, role and importance of the structure being attacked. *Example:* Capturing a Large Citadel structure could require attackers to go through 3 vulnerability phases before it is destroyed, while a Medium Observatory Array may only require 2.

229,vulnerability,Eve,"Different viewpoint on the extender/plate rebalance, or why I should sober up after a triple OT win before posting on reddit.",83,36mnep,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/36mnep/different_viewpoint_on_the_extenderplate/,2015-05-21 00:33:09,"I don't have any fancy math to back up my opinions, but this is how I was hoping they would fix the modules: Small Extenders and 200mm plates become the new 'Standards' as far as tank for frigates goes. Small gets a 75% HP increase over the proposed changes (700 for meta 0), PG increased slightly, signature penalty increased slightly to bring it closer to the live values of MSE. Overall, a small HP nerf for frigates, but lower signature penalty than medium extenders have for live values. Micro Extenders still exist and return to the loot tables (rip collectors), have their HP bumped up to 400 (Same as SSE on proposed changes), and have **0 signature penalty.** Don't freak. This is kinda what CCP wanted to do with their idea for their proposed small shield extenders. Medium Shield extenders have their 'overtanked' status bumped up, but with a twist. Same PG as previously (any ships that didn't need a MAPC gimped their fits anyways, so it should be fine), tiny bit more CPU cost (to match up with the trend that shields use more CPU but less PG than armor), HP bumped up slightly over the proposed changes, and get an extra 5 to signature penalty. Changes allow all three shield types to be viable. You have the no sig penalty MiSE for kiting ships to keep them from dying in one shot, you have the new standard tank SSE that allows frigates to not have to gimp their fits with fitting upgrades, and you have the overtanked MSE that lets frigates/destroyers get a big chunk of buffer, at the cost of more vulnerability. Allowing SSEs to become the standard tank for frigates will hopefully allow shield AFs to have a bit more power. With lower incoming damage and lower buffer, frigate logi will have a greater impact on them as well, as well as additional sources of self rep if they have the mid slots for it. MSE AFs and destroyers can still be vaible, but should probably be flown with bigger logi. As far as armor is concerned, 200mm gets lower mass penalties, a little more HP (to keep with the idea that armor has more buffer), and the same fitting costs. The mass penalty still being there is enough of a deterrence to prevent people from armor tanking ships like interceptors or fast T1 tackle, which is where 100mm comes in. 100mm gets more buffer and the MiSE treatment of **no mass penalty**. Everything else stays the same. 400mm gets the 'overtanked' MSE treatment. More HP, more PG and cpu cost, same mass as the proposed changes. Same idea as the shields. I think the proposed changes for shields and armor for Cruisers and up are fine. I don't know if we need an extra size for shields, but some people where asking for them in the other thread. inb4 downvotes because I'm a no-name and don't know what I'm talking about (both true). Go Hawks. Edit: **tl;dr** cuz I didn't see how long this got. SSE becomes the new MSE, but with lower Sig and buffer, MiSE becomes a viable variation of the proposed SSE for small Sig ships so they don't have too much buffer, MSE is bigger, both in HP and in signature penalty, to make SSE preferred in most cases. 200mm has lower mass, better HP, and won't get you yelled at by your FC for using it, 100mm has no mass penalty and has enough HP to make it an option for fast tackle that is limited in the mid slot department, 400mm gets a bit better, but keeps the proposed mass increase (which is actually a lot)."
230,vulnerability,Eve,[CSM10] Structures. ~christopher wall (noreply at blogger.com),25,36n81d,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/36n81d/csm10_structures_christopher_wall_noreply_at/,2015-05-21 02:51:17,"URL A [Dev blog](URL came out a bit ago. Alot of the stuff is pretty good, How ever there is always concerns. From a wormhole POV I have three main concerns 1) **No autodefenses** . I have several issues here, You have to set the vulnerability time for your prime time (ok you don't have to, but you'd be pretty crazy not to). So when its your best time to be on and playing with your mates, some one has to stay back to man the guns. This to me is terribly counter intuitive. After that you have the issue that without a hp threshold anyone in any ship can potentially reinforce a pos meaning that cloaked ship in system could easily reinforce a pos if your not about. 2) **Loot not dropping.** This isn't strictly true some minor stuff will drop, but it won't be how it is in w space where everything could potentially drop. Its one of the main reasons people invade for loot and without this its likely to not be worth the hassle. 3) **Just how will we find these new structures and get intel on who is inside.** This is probably the least impactful and easily solved of the three, alot has already be discussed regarding this. **Station games and linking.** **** I've had alot of people moan about wormholes getting docking games and this simply isn't the case. It basically comes down to a couple things, people not reading the feedback thread and CCP not explaining it really well. Here is what it will mostly be like. you will be docked, you will be able to see the grid outside. So can see if anyone is about. You undock and enter a linking phase, while in this linking phase you are invulnerable, can't lock people or be locked yourself. You will how ever be able to fly around the citadel to a certain distance. This will act as a pseudo force field. As for feedback, I've gone and spoke to nine different wormhole groups so far for approximately 11 hours. I've had some really great ideas and feedback along with alot of good questions that need to be asked, three A4 pages of wormhole questions and notes and another 1 page on general stuff. Which I have posted on to CCP's confluence. I've also been speaking to CCP Nullabor alot about issues regarding citadels in w space (500 plus lines of convo in the couple days before the dev blog coming out) So much so I feel pretty confident that he could now actually plan a semi decent wormhole invasion on his own. One of the main things I got from people was overall its a positive thing although its still really early, and we need to wait for more information. Which I totally agree with, We had a meeting with CCP this week to get a better feel for there overall ideas and will be getting more info to read through soon, which will be nice, I raised a few issues (number 1 to 3) and also mentioned how some stuff just wasn't explained all that well, which they are hoping to sort in the future, I'm pretty optimistic at the moment although its very early in the development at the moment. PS. I'm looking to try and find some tiny wormhole groups 20 max players to chat to about this."

For more details see the previous dev blogs[SUMMER 2015 NULLSEC AND SOV STATUS REPORT](URL and[POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS: SOVEREIGNTY PHASE TWO](URL * **Station Services** * Station services for outposts and conquerable stations are now enabled/disabled using the Entosis Link module. They have become immune to regular damage. * The structures have been moved away from the center of station to more appropriate locations on the station model. Each type of station/outpost has a different layout of service locations. * Services will take 5 minutes of uncontested Entosis Link activation (after completing a warm-up cycle) to enable/disable. To provide a defensive bonus, the time take to disable a service is increased according to the solar system's occupancy multiplier (more details in the dev blogs linked above) * **Activity Defense Multiplier** * System Sovereignty Index values now combine to form a single Activity Defense Multiplier. In this release the multiplier modifies the time required to disable station services, and in future releases it will modify the time required to capture and reinforce sovereignty structures. * Activating an Entosis Link module will now trigger a Weapon Timer. This causes the normal penalties on the ship (cannot jump/dock or switch ships in space) * A director in an alliances executor corporation is now able to set a default alliance vulnerability time. Currently this has no effect, but will allows alliances to pre-set their timer in preparation for the next stage of sovereignty changes coming in AEGIS. * **Entosis Link module** * Activating an Entosis Link module will now trigger a Weapon Timer. This causes the normal penalties on the ship (cannot jump/dock or switch ships in space) * **Default Alliance Vulnerability Time** * A director in an alliances executor corporation is now able to set a default alliance vulnerability time. Currently this has no effect, but will allows alliances to pre-set their timer in preparation for the next stage of sovereignty changes coming in AEGIS. ###Exploration:### * New systems are available that can be accessed via the Unidentified wormholes. (Unidentified wormholes can be found in systems that contain the Jove Observatory) ###Graphics:### * The second iteration of PBR has been applied to all ships, capital wrecks, turrets and drones. * The Naga has had a texture update. * Secondary lighting from ships and stations has been added. ###Gameplay:### * Ships in high-sec space piloted by a character with a Criminal Flag will now be unable to use in-space re-fitting facilities. ###Localization:### * All ship SKIN durations are now fully translated in Russian and German. ###Market:### * New items have been added to the Trade Goods Unknown Components Market category. ###Modules:### * Afterburners and Microwarpdrives have been rebalanced to reduce complexity and provide more meaningful options within each module set.

233,vulnerability,Eve,Micro Jump Drives for Carriers - an elegant solution to encourage small-scale use?,2,33e2s0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/33e2s0/micro_jump_drives_for_carriers_an_elegant/,2015-04-22 05:48:46,"I think most people can agree that one of the appealing aspects of RnK's Clarion Call series (aside from its ingenuity) is the usage of a single (or two) carriers to support a small gang. I suspect that taking part in this type of gameplay would be appreciated by a decent proportion of players. However, RnK's use of single triage carriers dates back to a slightly safer era for carriers and saw only very *very* specific use. With the changes to capital gate usage and the implementation of FozzieSov on the way, the carrier is in a strange spot. Carriers are still highly effective en masse, but their vulnerability to be held down by a single Keres or dictor before getting dogpiled with more tackle makes them largely uninteresting from a small or even medium-scale perspective. I feel that introducing an XL Micro Jump Drive (for carriers only) would not solve all of the carrier's problems nor eliminate the ping-ping-ping-carrier-tackled allure of the ship class, but might create more opportunities for groups that want to try using carriers on a smaller scale. The mechanics behind the MJD lend themselves well to the carrier. One of the small-scale carrier's greatest problems is that it can be held in place by a single bubble or by frigates who can maintain transient tackle from a safe distance. The small-scale carrier's fleet is capable of burning out of bubbles, but the carrier is not. The MJD forces hostiles to come into scram range, which gives the carrier an opportunity to apply heavy tackle and remove those ships from the field. In application, the carrier could still be dogpiled. A dogpiled carrier will not be able to remove tackle quickly enough to MJD away, but the MJD *does* confer a greater window of opportunity to remove a handful of tacklers, dodge a bubble, and peace out before the 40 man gang lands. You've probably already had the red flags go off that such a change would make a doctrine like Slowcats extremely overpowered. For this reason, the XL MJD would have a unique restriction in that it **Cannot be used within 20km of another capital ship**. This means that your bubbled 20-man slowcat fleet can't just MJD away from hostile dreads. The MJD would only benefit single- or possibly double-carrier fleet compositions. Introduction of a hostile carrier within 20km of the carrier would also prevent MJD use, firmly locking both onto the field. ----------- This isn't intended to be a complete solution for all of the carrier's problems as a ship class, nor intended to completely change the meta. I do not think that every fleet will take a carrier around with them if XL MJD were implemented, but I do feel that it is an avenue of play that would be used and appreciated by some groups. Under FozzieSov, the use of a single carrier with a small support fleet might prove effective for both attackers and defenders, and doubly so if the carrier (as a ship class) wasn't a nearly immobile coffin that can be held down by a single Keres or dictor."

235,vulnerability,Eve,Addressing Foreseeable Problems with the Upcoming Sovereignty Changes,0,2y4oe1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2y4oe1/addressing_foreseeable_problems_with_the_upcoming/,2015-03-06 23:22:03,"Hey! I've been playing Eve since 2010 and I've spent most of my time with a null sec Alliance. I think the changes to Sovereignty are overall good but there are definitely some glaring problems to the upcoming system. Below I've outlined the ones that seem most relevant to me. 1. As the system is stated by CCP the attacker doesn't need to commit to harass sovereignty holders. A bunch of interceptors can reinforce a whole constellation with little risk or effort. If someone wants Sovereignty they should be forced to fight for it and commit forces rather than be able to avoid fights entirely. The risk versus reward is too heavily shifted towards the attacker. The issues with the ESS is a great example of how the attacker can harass the defender too much with too little effort. 2. Cloaked alts will be put in every system in a constellation to win command nodes. While CCP envisions larger engagements being spread out into smaller skirmishes over several systems the truth is cloaked alts will be everywhere to grab the command nodes before fleets can be directed to go take them. Once again there is very little risk or commitment to take nodes. Cloaked alts will be waiting in every system to reinforce everything which is a boring waiting game resulting in very little content and fun to be had by either side. 3. The 4 hour prime-time vulnerability will alienate the off time members of alliances and result in other problems such as neighboring enemy alliances with different timezone unable to fight each other due to their timezone differences. Also people who have jobs and other obligations may not have even four hours to spend playing EVE every single night. Forcing Sovereignty Holding alliance members to chase interceptors and other hard to catch gangs around for four straight hours encompassing all the time they have for Eve a night every night is a great way to push people back to high-sec. To start I have several proposed solutions for the problems up for discussion: 1. The attacker should be forced to commit forces to take sovereignty and the attacker should have to commit to defend it as well. This can be accomplished by limiting the Etosis link to a battle cruiser and above. Others have proposed cruisers and above but this does not stop nullified t3's from moving about freely taking sovereignty without fighting. Battle-cruisers are large and slow enough that the attacking fleet would find it hard to avoid a fight with the defending forces creating content for both sides. Small gangs would still be able to cause havoc if the defenders are not willing to commit forces to stop them. Additionally this would help shift the meta to ships larger than cruisers with a focus on staying power over mobility. This would force fights as a smaller force doesn't have to hold the field but just survive long enough to finish their Etosis link hacking. 2. Limiting the Etosis link to battle-cruisers will help the cloaking alts issue somewhat, but I think a further step is required. An Etosis link should require a rig that prevents the use of a cloaking device and also cannot be fitted from mobile depots. This serves twofold. Fleets will have to have dedicated Etosis link ships (or forgo a rig slot on their doctrine) that need to be protected. This means that much like there are hero sabres that pin down that super there will be similar hero link ships that take Sovereignty rather than every ship in a fleet with a spare high slot fitting an Etosis for utility. Secondly it will limit but not prevent spamming cloaked alts in t1 battle cruisers from impacting sovereignty warfare too much. The only ship that should be able to fit an Etosis rig and a cloak (via t2 covert ops Etosis rig or equivalent) should be black ops battleships and specialized ships such as the Nestor because they are significant commitments and should have the ability to shake things up much like interceptors or combat recons do to bubbles and the d-scan. 3. The 4 hour window seems like it will cause more problems than it will fix. I propose that a shorter window be created perhaps 1-2 hours where all systems owned by an alliance become vulnerable. The caveat to this is that sovereignty owned systems that border other alliances (even allies or coalition members) are always vulnerable or vulnerable for a much greater 12-24 hour window. So border systems for alliance sovereign systems will almost always been reinforced creating warzones that need to be fought over constantly. This behooves alliances to use choke-points and not share sovereignty with other alliances as it will make their adjacent systems vulnerable. This also means that getting a foothold in the middle of held sovereignty during the few vulnerable hours makes every adjacent system vulnerable for almost all time zones. I feel that this would make holding space worth it because your inner systems are relatively safe except for that one hour you have to defend. If you don't defend during that hour and lose an inner system your whole empire becomes vulnerable to attack. Additionally I would like to see the defenders have some sort of influence on the reinforcement timers ( Similar to POS reinforcement) so if they plan properly they can set the time for the fight over command nodes. Once again I'm very excited for the new changes and hope they'll shake Null Sec up a bit. I'm certain CCP is going to figure out their own solutions for the problems with the implementation of the new Sovereignty mechanics. I'm guessing they'll do something such as limit Etosis links to a t3 subsystem or some other factor as giving Etosis links to interceptors will just be a headache for everyone. I just wanted to throw my two cents out and open up a discussion for suggestions to fix foreseeable problems with the upcoming Sovereignty changes. The TLDR version: New Sovereignty mechanics will cause problems. My Ideas: Etosis links are battle-cruisers, battleships and capitals only / require Etosis rigs to use Etosis links that prevent cloaking except for black ops battleships + Nestor / Systems that border other alliance sovereignty always vulnerable, all systems vulnerable very short prime-time during day. Discuss."
236,vulnerability,Eve,[FozzieSov] Challenges,0,2ykytw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2ykytw/fozziesov_challenges/,2015-03-11 05:01:59,"Hey! Another post on the new sov system. So Fozzie has given his point of view on some of the major questions regarding the new sov system. Here's my summary about his general guidelines: * No more structure bashing * Supers &amp; Titans have to change role * Unoccupied space should be easy to conquier * Living in that space should benefit the defender * Sov warfare should be available for smaller groups * Victory shall be defined by multiple grid control. Enthosis is a proposal in that way. So far so good. That's in par with what the community wanted and asked CCP to do. Questions have been raised mainly about: * The 20/24 protected TZ issue * The need to have occupancy indexes reviewed * Incentives to live in null sec space * Owning sov may not be worthy. Station and iHub are important but TCU are likely less important * Sov harassment may be too easy * The possible abuses in the Enthosis thing * Mechanics of the multiple grid system (too much grids ? what about small corp having to defend in an hostile constellation) Dev team made also very clear that their proposal was an early one and that lots of thing could be changed. On the other hand, and by my professional experience, the more we will advance in time, the less they will be able to accept drastic changes into their project. So we, as players, have a excellent opportunity to participate in that debate and make our game better. This is something unique to Eve in the current market. As far as I understand the problematic: * The TZ issue is likely to be adressed in some way. Several good options have been fielded (extended ir dynamic vulnerability time). * Titans and Super carriers will probably be looked at as a secondary project * Sov holding and null sec incentives are vast questions. They should be treated appart * The major priority now is to answer to Fozzie's main issue : Enthosis is a way to determine who has the control of the grid and this is very difficult for a computer to determine it. So let's focus here on the grid control question. What would be a good scalable mechanic that determine grid control ? "
237,vulnerability,Eve,In Which 100b In BPOs Is Stolen,46,2xcxk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/2xcxk1/in_which_100b_in_bpos_is_stolen/,2015-02-28 02:29:43,"The roles were audited. Alts were placed in them and every known method of abuse was applied diligently. Hangars were checked. Containers were checked. Small amounts of valuable blueprints had been left as honeypots - if they were grabbed, the overall collection would survive, and a new breach would be identified then swiftly closed. None of it mattered. A very short window opened up after months of monitoring. One tiny vulnerability was missed. It had been tested on a honeypot blueprint, after which everything was returned exactly the way it was found. Early on, the collection was scattered over multiple systems, with multiple active researchers. Any deviation would be noticed. Any missing blueprint would cause the entire research project to be suspended and the collection hidden again. Unlike many similar collections, this collection was not a result of slow organic growth from a motivated industrialist making market purchases. It had been assembled, one theft at a time, purchased from scammers through backchannels like a fence. Recruitment scams for free freighter service. Role-based corporation thefts from infiltrators. Disgruntled directors flipping available assets on the way out. Pulling together a dozen separate stolen caches was only part of the effort involved. With Industry changes on the horizon, there was a frenzied project in nullsec to push every blueprint to the minimum threshold that would become perfect material efficiency after the changes. However, the other industrial challenges faced by the owner and the size of the hoard meant specialists were needed to assist with research. This was where I slipped in. At first, the collection was separated across multiple locations and multiple characters. The owner did his homework. The bins containing blueprint were not accessible, they were in a hangar set to view only, and the only way to interact with the blueprints was through the Industry menu. I tried many ways to alter their location in the menu - output to after each type of research, output to after building, running in POS arrays instead of the station, canceling jobs, and everything else I could think of. The breakthrough came after another player got director roles and we began recruiting. My roles, which were similar to a director's but missing some key things, were shifted ever so slightly. One degree had changed my life before, and now, it would do so again. [information on the specific method is redacted but available for 5 bil]. Okay. Now I had the method, but the collection was scattered over half a dozen systems from Empire to deep null. There was no plausible way to push for consolidation without revealing my intent to steal everything. Queue months of research. Then, upheaval. Great changes swept through nullsec with the announcement of jump fatigue. Power grabs and bloc warfare caused large parts of the collection to get evacuated in the middle of the night. No place was safe, the owner hid the pile in the safety of Empire and we went inactive for a while. Those changes kept going, though. Freeports, once a joke, started opening up. Earnest young rebels began trying to carve out pieces of null that the major powers abandoned. The owner saw an opportunity to reclaim sov space and we were suddenly back in business. Touting a banner of liberation for the serfs of rental empires, we returned to nullsec. This was it. Everything would be brought to one place. A vast panorama opened up, piles of blueprints cascading over my nude pod-bound body. This could be a vast heist, ironically re-stealing many goods I had already stolen to provide in the first place through alts. After waiting a little bit, I got more active. Recruited some guys. Asked to waive the bonus for recruitment in favor of an Astero, trained up perfect probing skills and some cloaking. While the Astero never arrived, all the blueprints did. It was time. The theft itself was anticlimactic. Drag. Drop. Sort by value over 1 million isk. Return bins and cheap BPOs. Check mouseover. 69 billion isk total displayed, which with the perfect material efficiency and hefty volumes of time improvements came to easily 100b. Station egg with upgrades. Carriers. Capital parts. Dreads. Ships and drones and rigs and modules of such bewildering range that I stopped reading. It was everything you would need to arm a nullsec alliance for war. Unfortunately, I had completely forgotten that the Astero wasn't here yet. Those blueprints were stuck 40+ jumps from civilization on a character with no interceptor skills or T3 skills, in a volume of space with no probes or cloaks for sale. 65 jumps in an interceptor from the dreaming heavens of Deklein, I eventually had an alt on hand to make the extraction. What followed was the most terrifying undock to date. Rendevous at next door system. Jetcan. Run like the hounds of hell were after me and had been denied loving care for weeks. I made it into Empire. The corporation found out quickly, but assuming I was sane, thought the blueprints were still in the station. They knew I didn't get cloaks, probes, or escape ships and that I was a cautious man, so I'd be sitting on the blueprints. Maybe I'd barter for their return, maybe not. Either way, they weren't going to travel far. This is where things took a turn for the comedic. The next day, I brought out a shuttle, taunting people that it contained blueprints, and went next door warping around to safes every few minutes. A wormhole native dropped out of hellscape. He gets a convo from a corp member about how I'm here with tons of stolen blueprints and they want to kill me, could the wormholer help. Being immune to taking sides other than his own thanks to living in a wormhole, he immediately convos me for confirmation. I pretend to be a bitter industrialist, link him an Evepraisal of the haul, and send over the alliance mail about the theft. He brings friends. They offer an evac. Before I can convince them to give me money, I catch wife aggro offline. One dinner later, things have escalated to tengus and gilas and perfect probers and gatefights. Unfortunately, my time AFK is enough for them to grab me. After negotiations break down due to me hitting self destruct timer, they find an empty shuttle kill. Confusion reigns. I quickly grab another shuttle from space and taunt the alliance before going AFK again for post-prandial drinks. Come back to another empty shuttle loss. The farce gets old, I dock up, steal another bil in courier contracts, and then a newbro asks for some help getting a discount on skillbooks. Being a nice guy, I hem and haw, ultimately agreeing to a 50% discount. A secure container is contracted over for 19 million isk of the 20 million isk he had made in EVE so far. This feels almost as good as the big heist, albeit with less joy over planning. Then I started growing sick of sin. The blueprints were mine, wealth incalculable for most random people in EVE. But there was a social cost to acquire them. I spent time with these people. They influenced my career moves. We shared war stories from work. I talked about overcoming cancer, they shared struggles in marriages and homes. My cover was too good and I suddenly found myself inexplicably empty after the role, instinctively going to check chat channels I was blocked from. The best ship in EVE is a friendship, they say. I crashed one for an lifetime supply of less-than-best ships. While I got enough isk to never have to indulge in pve activities again, it had an incredibly steep price, one I am not sure I would pay if I could re-do all of this."

As EVE Online has a lot of out-of-game tools it is important for capsuleers not only to secure their in-game assets but also to be careful with out-of-game systems that might compromise their accounts... # What is OPsec for Gamers? [CDSEChris!](URL Hi, I'm Chris. I founded the Operations Security (OPSEC) Professional's Association. I also teach cybersecurity for the federal government and contractors under the National Industrial Security Program. I'm also working on presentation about [OPSEC in EVE Online!](URL that I'll be presenting at the National OPSEC Symposium in June. (...) I'll be posting them here before the conference, and hopefully I'll be able to record the actual presentation and share it as well. What you're talking about is probably better referred to as information security, cybersecurity, or the depreciated term ""information assurance."" Those disciplines are concerned with protecting information systems like computers, servers, etc. Operations Security, or OPSEC, is actually focused on protecting critical information that can give away friendly plans, intentions, capabilities, things like that. Both have their place here, and they actually work well together. While the terms are often used interchangeably, I think it's important to look at the concepts individually and see how they can each benefit us. [Mad Librarian]: For a slightly different take on OPsec you can also watch the [OPsec for Hackers talk by Grugq!](URL # INFOSEC: Information Security Tips (protecting your machine) [CDSEChris!](URL As far as protecting your computer, which is the core question here, there's a few important things to remember: (I'm not going to repeat the advice already given in this thread, because those are all GREAT points. Especially about passwords and ad-blockers) 1. **Update everything.** Everything installed on your computer is a potential point of entry into it and into your network. Install updates and patches for your operating system, your browser, your office suite. Patch all your software, especially the internet-facing ones like flash, java, and adobe. Some of the most damaging recent hacks and breaches were caused by out of date software, when patches were already available. 2. **Watch where you go online.** There's something called a Watering Hole Attack where certain sites are compromised and the targets are encouraged to visit them. This may be done by compromising already popular sites, or it may be done by creating a new site and then trying to encourage people to visit. I talk a little bit about that here, if it helps. For the same reason, don't follow unsolicited links or click on untrusted attachments. 3. **Consider using a virtual machine for anything... risky.** A virtual machine is basically a computer session that runs on your computer, but in a ""sandbox"" mode that doesn't normally interface with the rest of your computer. I feel like this is a good place for the ""yo dawg"" meme... So if your virtual machine gets a virus, you can just delete it and start over. I like to use virtualbox, but that's just a matter of preference. 4. **Use an antivirus program, but don't trust it.** Antivirus programs primarily rely on signatures- that is, known code that flags software as a virus- or heuristics, which is virus-like behavior. They're good, although some of us don't like the resource hit. All the same, use one, keep it updated, and scan your computer regularly. However, know that they're not perfect. They can get infected, too, or sometimes they can miss things. If you suspect that's the case, use an online virus scanner from any of the major providers. 5. **Configure your firewall.** Your computer most likely has one built in, and your probably have one on your router, too. Use 'em. You can configure them to be as restrictive as you want, but the one on your computer can be configured to let you know when new programs try to connect to the internet. That's pretty handy to know! At a minimum, make sure that you're protecting your inbound connections so that an attacker has a harder time getting in. And make sure to block icmp echo requests- that should be a specific option available. ""Pinging"" (that is, sending such a request to) your computer is often the first step in an attack; it shows that your computer's online and responding to connection requests. Blocking pings can stop casual attacks before they start. 6. **BACK UP YOUR COMPUTER!** All your data, or at least the stuff you want back. Seriously, copy your files to google. Get dropbox. Buy an external drive. I think I have some old floppy discs lying around I can send you. Whatever it is, back up your files. Ransomeware's on the rise, and it's only getting worse. If you're infected, you might be able to pay the ransom and get your data back... maybe. But if that happens, you want to be in control of your data. Back up whatever you want to back up, but please back up something. And call your mother, she wants to hear from you. 7. **Uninstall programs you're not using anymore.** That saves space, but it also helps to reduce potential attack vectors. 8. **Do your normal computer browsing as a regular user**; use your admin account only for adminstrative tasks. That helps reduce the impact of a compromise or infection. The agency I work for has a [publicly available cybersecurity course!](URL that really gets into the meat of that. Some of you already know this course well, and I apologize for the fact that you have to take it every year. Not my call. Maybe if you try chasing down the phone thief they'll be so impressed with your tenacity that they'll give you a year off, I dunno. # OPSEC: Protecting your information [CDSEChris!](URL I'd like to talk for a moment about OPSEC and how it can actually support your information security efforts. As I mentioned, OPSEC is a lot more than INFOSEC, but they go hand-in-hand in a lot of ways. If I could convey just one thing, it would be to make yourself less interesting to a potential attacker. Try to avoid standing out, at least in a way that pairs your online persona with your real one. Think about the information that you're giving away when you post online, and what that might give to a hacker or other potential adversary. We're often not as anonymous as we like to think we are, and it's not difficult for an attacker to build a useful profile about us to allow them to spear phish us (that is, send us a phishing email that's highly tailored to us, specifically). Here's a little bit [more information on OPSEC in general!](URL # Tools for INFOSEC 1. **Secure your browser:** * Use the [latest version of your browser - check here!](URL * Try only to use HTTPS - secure connections to a website - there are [adons that can force secure connections!](URL if any are available. * Use Ad blockers - they remove or alter advertising content from a webpage, website, or a mobile app. Ads can contain phishing links, malware, pornographic images, irritations such as flashing colours and sound, stealing data and draining data allowances... some [Background!](URL Examples are [uBlock Origin Plugins!](URL [Privacy Badger Plugins!](URL [Mustasade!](URL and [Key Lime!](URL mentioned also [NoScript for Firefox!](URL * [Niraia!](URL For more control, at the expense of more hassle while you figure out what a site needs in order to function, I love uMatrix ( [Chrome!](URL - [Firefox](URL Works happily alongside uBlock Origin. * And finally - configure your browsers for security as far as that is possible: [Browser Security Settings for Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer: Cybersecurity 101!](URL 2. **Secure your network** * [jhhnl!](URL If you really want to block all ads and trackers you should give [PiHole!](URL a look. It blocks the internet addresses on a DNS level. This together with a VPN and a reverse proxy of the PiHole gives you a lot more security on your data and internet behavior. 3. **Secure your Operating System** * Swift On Security has a basic [guide for securing Windows 7 and higher!](URL that is a good starting point. * [Batolemaeus!](URL Use a secure operating system like [Gentoo Linux!](URL 4. **Secure your Passwords and information** * [Funkmaster_Plex!](URL you forgot the most important ones: never use the same password (and username if possible) on multiple sites/services; use 2-factor where available. I will extend the guide from the comments (thx for the great posts so far) and also [post it on our blog so the info remains there!](URL if it does get de.listed again... "
