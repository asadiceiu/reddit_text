0,vulnerability,DnD,How to Scale XP for custom higher cr monsters 5e,1,i34z15,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i34z15/how_to_scale_xp_for_custom_higher_cr_monsters_5e/,2020-08-04 06:33:17,"So I have home brewed a world and what not. The PCs are part of a Guild that sends them out to hunt down monsters. I took Inspiration in home brewing the monsters as described in the Zee Bashew video [URL where you take a Monster 3 cr higher than the average party level, give it 3 extra resistances, 1 immunity and then give it a vulnerability and other ways to cripple it to make the fight easier. I liked the idea because it gave the characters the need to role play as they researched the creature and had to plan out their attack ahead of time. The players are level 3. The first session they had to hunt down a Chimera, and they did a fantastic job of gathering information and setting up a trap. Two went down due to the fire breath, but the Rogue popped out with a crit on a sneak attack to end it. Everyone was happy. In the end though, I felt that the typical xp they would get from fighting a creature like that was off. Splitting 2,300 xp 5 ways, when the creature had the possibility of killing one or all of them if things went wrong in the slightest, seemed too little, even with the halved hp. So I decided 1,400 xp for each player kind of worked. It was an accumulation of gathering information, setting up a trap, roleplay and actually slaying the monster. If we're looking at the Xp, just for killing the monster, what amount would other DMs give their PCs. I also gave bonus xp to players that I felt were really doing well with role playing their characters."
1,vulnerability,DnD,Dm is coddling the party,1,i69v6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i69v6q/dm_is_coddling_the_party/,2020-08-09 10:15:14,"I was playing dnd the other day and my DM decided to let a player character do something that really shouldnt have worked. Let me explain so me and another PC were attempting to fight 4 creatures with about 100 health at level 5 each which honestly would have seemed hard at first, but we did get ourselves into the situation. But friend who is the other PC decides to use shocking grasp on the water all the creatures were in which is already outside of the spells actual use I didnt point this out because I didnt want to ruin the fun, but all 4 creatures took double damage from the attack which were knocked out for 4 turns, while we were able to literally just walk away. (Creatures didnt have any vulnerability to lightning damage asked after the session) I brought it up with the DM after the session because I just felt like the situation made no sense and felt we were being coddled. But I dont think I was able to really explain to him why I felt like we were just being given a way out rather than earning it. Im just looking for advice on what to do anything is appreciated."
2,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrewed a Vampire Race - Critiques and Criticisms Wanted,1,i6a4n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i6a4n6/homebrewed_a_vampire_race_critiques_and/,2020-08-09 10:32:30,"This is my first time homebrewing a race, and I did take some bits and pieces based on what I could find for Vampires in 5e. I showed this to a fellow player and they mentioned it was a bit complicated. There are two traits (Natural Regeneration and Forbiddance) that I think the race can do without, but I can't tell if the race would still be complicated. Vampire Traits * ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2 and your Dexterity score by 1. * ***Age.*** Vampires are immortal. They age at the same rate as humans until they reach adulthood. From then on, they age at a significantly slower rate. * ***Alignment.*** Most Vampires keep to themselves or stay amongst their own kind in the darkness. Not all are prone to evil, but an overindulgence or lack of blood may lead to a more chaotic mindset. Nobility within the Vampire community typically maintain order and often fall under the lawful alignment. * ***Size.*** Your size is Medium. * ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. * ***Undead Resistance.*** You have resistance necrotic damage. * ***Superior Darkvision.*** Accustomed to living in the night you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. * ***Vampiric Charm.*** You know the Friends cantrip and have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Command spell at 2nd-level once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Upon reaching 5th level, you can cast the Suggestion spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting modifier for these spells. * ***{Bloody} Bite.*** You can use your fangs to make a Bite attack on a humanoid, dealing 1d4+Strength damage. In addition, you can spend up to 1/4 of your hit dice (minimum of one) to deal additional necrotic damage by sucking their blood. You then recover the hit points based on the necrotic damage dealt. You cannot spend hit dice using this feature again until you complete a short or long rest. * ***Natural Regeneration.*** While taking a Short Rest, you regain an additional 1d4 hit points for every hit die you expend. The amount increases when you reach 5th level (1d6), 10th level (2d4), 15th level (2d6), and 20th level (2d8). * ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. ### Thirst For Blood The longer you go without consuming blood, the weaker you feel and you begin losing control over your instincts. Every night you go without drinking blood past the threshold of 4 days, you suffer one level of exhaustion and it becomes harder to fight your craving for blood. Consuming the blood of an animal will temporarily remove one level of exhaustion until the following night. Once you drink humanoid blood however, you recover from all levels of exhaustion and your behavior returns to that of a civil nature. When you have gone at least 6 days without drinking blood (2 levels of exhaustion), make a wisdom saving throw, DC 14. If you succeed, you suppress the urge to drink the blood of any humanoids around you. If you fail, you will lose control and attack until you are restrained or you consume blood. The DC will increase with every additional level of exhaustion you gain. Consuming animal blood will also temporarily reduce the DC. ### Vulnerabilities * ***Standard Vulnerability.*** You are vulnerable to radiant damage. * ***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** When exposed to, or starting your turn in direct sunlight, you take 1d8 radiant damage. * ***Running Water.*** When entering or starting your turn in running water, you take 1d8 acid damage. * ***Blessings.*** When in contact with or starting your turn in something that is blessed or holy, you take 1d10 radiant damage. In addition, when the Bless spell is cast on you, it acts as the Bane spell. Bane, on the other hand, acts like the Bless spell for you. * ***Forbiddance.*** You are not supposed to enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. If you do so, make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save you take 1d8 force damage and cannot enter the residence. On a success, you enter but will take 1d4 force damage every round until you are properly invited to the residence."
3,vulnerability,DnD,"I'm planning on making a homebrew greatsword variant, due to how similar GS and Maul are",1,i6m05r,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i6m05r/im_planning_on_making_a_homebrew_greatsword/,2020-08-10 02:17:20,"I was thinking of, since they're mechanically twins (unless a RARE enemy with vulnerability to bludgeoning comes along), that I'd add a variant greatsword. Instead of dealing 2d6 slashing, I was thinking, what if it dealt 2d4 slashing, and had a 19-20 crit range instead, while the maul stayed 2d6, but only crit on 20's as usual?"
4,vulnerability,DnD,Is this balanced and fair (what do you think) Also I used bits and pieces word for ford from u/Leuku 's reply from another thing on vampires as PCs,1,i6p253,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i6p253/is_this_balanced_and_fair_what_do_you_think_also/,2020-08-10 05:08:18," **Vampire Subrace Stats** Pick any race and include those stats and features **Upsides** * ***Superior Darkvision-*** Darkvision up to 120 feet. * ***Resistance to Necrotic Damage*** * ***Life drinker-*** You gain a bite attack. It deals 1d4 piercing damage, and you can use either your strength or dexterity modifier for the attack and damage. If you hit a creature that has blood you can drink (DM's discretion) with a bite attack, you can as a bonus action attempt to suck some vitality out of the creature. The creature makes a constitution saving throw against DC 10 + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the creature expends and rolls one of their hit dice and you gain that plus their constitution modifier in hp. If the creature has no more hit dice available, you still roll to gain hp and they gain a level of exhaustion. * ***Blood Knowledge-*** You gain advantage on perception checks that rely on smell to detect and track the presence of blood. * ***Vampiric Magic-*** You know the *Sapping Sting* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast *False Life* once per day. When you reach 5th level you can cast *Blindness/Deafness* once per day. **Downsides** * ***Sunlight Hypersensitivity-*** If you start your turn in sunlight you take 15% of X radiant damage, where X is your total health (Unless most of the skin is covered). * ***Forbiddance-*** You cant enter a building without an invitation from one of the occupants. * ***Harmed by Running Water-*** You take 15% of X acid damage, where X is your total health if you end your turn in running water. * ***Stake to the Heart-*** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is removed * ***Vulnerability to Radiant Damage*** ***Bloodlust-*** Each day you go without drinking blood from a creature adds one level of exhaustion to you. These exhaustion levels do not go away unless you drink the blood of another creature. However by drinking more than necessary you can go longer without drinking blood. If you drain a medium creature of all their blood you can go 7 days without drinking blood. If you drink half of a medium creatures blood you can go 4 days without drinking blood. If you make a bite attack you can remove one level of exhaustion."
5,vulnerability,DnD,DnD Card Sets,1,i92fta,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/i92fta/dnd_card_sets/,2020-08-14 01:54:53," There already are a few posts with lists of cards included per pack, however I missed a complete list with ALL the packs. It made ordening stuff a bit harder. So while putting all the cards in the right place, I made a list of all the monster and item packs I currently own. **The list includes:** \- Monster Cards Challenge 0-5 \- Monster Cards Challenge 6-16 \- Volo's Guide to Monsters \- Creature &amp; NPC Cards \- Epic Monster Cards **And as a bonus:** \- Magic Item Cards Some sets have, besides the regular size cards (marked in the list as small cards), larger cards, that are double the size of the regular cards. I know the most common card sleeves fit around the small cards, but I havent really looked for sleeves of the large cards. So I have no idea if they exist. I do have a lot of the spellcards too. I do plan on making lists of those in the future as well. If there's any need for any list in particular, let me know. The only one I'm currently missing as far as I know is the bard set, because one of my players already owns it. But I do plan on buying an own set very soon.

7,vulnerability,DnD,Necromancer - maximizing Animate Dead as a level 8 wizard.,1,icegtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/icegtk/necromancer_maximizing_animate_dead_as_a_level_8/,2020-08-19 11:40:59,"How to create your Undead army Im using an 8th level Necromancer wizard drow elf in DND 5e Animate dead spell plus Undead Thralls A few reminders of the rules in the players handbook- Animate Dead This spell creates an Undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a corpse of a Medium or Small Humanoid within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an Undead creature. The target becomes a Skeleton if you chose bones or a Zombie if you chose a corpse (the DM has the creature's game statistics). On each of your turns, you can use a Bonus Action to mentally Command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can Command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same Command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general Command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against Hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete. The creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it stops obeying any Command you've given it. To maintain the control of the creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the creature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one. At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th Level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two additional Undead creatures for each slot above 3rd. Each of the creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones. At 6th level, you add the Animate Dead spell to your spell book if it is not there already. When you cast Animate Dead, you can target one additional corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as appropriate. Whenever you create an undead using a necromancy spell, it has additional benefits:  The creature's hit point maximum is increased by an amount equal to your wizard level. +8  The creature adds your proficiency bonus to its weapon damage rolls. +3 . To maintain control of your skeletons cast animate dead again before the 24 hours and you continue to control 4 skeletons per casting using a level 3 slot , or 6 per casting using level 4. (undead thralls does NOT give you an extra Skeleton to control it only raises them). You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest (8 hours). A character cant benefit from more than one Long Rest in a 24-hour period. Even an elf who goes into a trance and does not sleep still needs 8 hours of REST to get all spell slots. Arcane Recovery You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spell book. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. For example, if you're a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots. So at level 8 you get back a 4th level animate dead casting . Walking Dead idea Have a pit where you throw bodies and animate the dead to raise skeletons who you lose control over after 24 hours , but they are trapped there. But you can make loads of them over time. Then, you release the hoard! But this is my real Animate Dead PLAN Day 1: Make 14 skeletons at 10pm. (use 3 x lvl 3, 2 x lvl 4 = 3x2, and 2x4 =14 skeletons) 1 hour Short rest. Make 4 more at 11pm.(regained lvl 4 slot) total 18 skeletons Sleep for a long rest at 11pm (8 hours) Day 2 7am: all spell slots are regained and 18 skeletons are under control until 10pm 9pm: reassert control over 6 +6, (2 lvl 4 spells) Take a Short rest 10pm: another 6 controlled (regained lvl 4 spell) Use lvl 3 spell x3 slots to make 6 more total under control at 10pm is 18+6 =24. Long rest 11pm for 8 hours Day 3: 7am-make 4 more with a lvl 4 spell. (Total is 24 + 4 = 28 controlled) Short rest. Til 8am. Regain the lvl 4 spell All spell slots are ready and 28 skeletons under your control til 9pm !! If they live through the battle and you have spell slots: regain control 4,4,4,6,6: 24 every day. If you have no spell slots then you lose control at 9pm (18 skeletons) and 10pm (6) and then 7am (4). So command them into the pit before losing control If you want to go all in, then make 14 more at 8am on day 3 to give 28+14 = 42 skeletons til 9pm on battle day! (but you have no 3rd or 4th level spells that day) You can use zombies but I chose skeletons for this army SKELETON Medium undead, lawful evil  Armor Class 13 (Armor Scraps)  Hit Points 13 (2d8+4) +8 = 21 HP (at level 8)  Speed 30 ft.

8,vulnerability,DnD,"PC creating custom shrink spell, need help with wording and specifics",1,iedu3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/iedu3z/pc_creating_custom_shrink_spell_need_help_with/,2020-08-22 16:47:54,"So one of my players, our Sorcerer, is wanting to create their own spell under the idea that they are through pure charisma shaping their magic in a way they want. Which i'm more than happy to accommodate. He was wanting a shrinking spell, similar to Enlarge/Reduce. They want the ability to control the exact size they reduce to, and to have the ability to shrink them down as small as around 5 inches tall. Being that small I feel would have side effects, and I originally thought maybe vulnerability to various damage types, but I'm not sure. Also wanted a side affect in case they tried to pull an ant-man with every enemy they see and explode them from the inside. I was probably going to make it 4th level, as you can use Polymorph at 4th level to shrink a dragon into an ant, and this would also mean there is not a size limit on the target of the spell. He also wants to be able to target multiple creatures, so up-casting for more targets is definitely being considered. This is something that he and I have been going back and forth on for a few days, now i'm just trying to get the specifics down. Also thinking that its a touch spell, and the material component is a piece of wool and some water. ""The caster causes a target to shrink to a desired size for the duration. Choose a creature that you can see within range. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. You choose a desired size for to shrink the target to, to a maximum of only 5 inches tall. All items carried by the target are altered to a proportionate size along with it. If the target is shrunk under 1ft tall, the targets maximum hp is lowered to half of its total, and its AC is lowered by 5. The targets physical attacks also can only do a maximum of 1 damage, not including any magical effect from enchanted weapons."" All suggestions are appreciated!"
9,vulnerability,DnD,more nuanced 3.5/5e opinion,1,ieq720,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ieq720/more_nuanced_355e_opinion/,2020-08-23 06:51:19," Hello! I started D&amp;D in the 3.5 era, was really when I fell in love with the game. Obv lots of homebrew mods to keep things sane back then. This year I finally took the dive into 5e (still lots of homebrew). Here are some of my thoughts/conclusions wondering what others think? Any similar feelings or disagreements? \-proficiency and advantage disadvantage are nice, but proficiency alone is too simple. So many levels without even one bonus increasing or anything interesting to choose. I homebrew four levels of proficiency using 5e rules that already exist and some tiers as from pathfinder 2e. allows MUCH more customization/individualization with stats level to level, but is not difficult or unwieldy or nearly as complex a 3.5 (esp skills). \-skills: 3.5 had too many skills, 5e simplified a good amount but did not perfect (still some random ass skills -- handle animal is its own skill? not enough social/knowledge skills -- i have a more refined and i believe better group of skills that define characters in a more interesting way -- but overall 5e RAW &gt;&gt; 3.5 RAW. \-Magic: i like concentration, i like toning down spell access for magic casters at higher levels (they're still super powerful). however, one thing i can't quite get into: boring and nerfed spells all around. almost everything gets a saving throw per round. see blindness/deafness, hold person. I made hold person a higher level spell in 3.5, and of course used such spells sparingly against players in 3.5, or even inaccessible except by storyline quests, especially certain necromancy spells-- but that allowed them to have that much more power and awe behind them, and the players LOVED it. now it's sort of a weird video game thing where nothing is permanent and everything is forgiving. in 3.5 if you approach a big bad lv 15 necromancer boss with no research and no prep, you seriously risk everyone dying in a few rounds. in 5e pretty much nothing is nearly as intimidating or scary unless it's way higher level than you, which is a mechanical difference not a flavor/quest-based difference. Overall, despite some good changes, i generally find the 3.5 spell lists to be more fun for the game. they were more colorful, unique, scary, awe-inspiring and epic. i have players who played 3.5 with me looking through spells like ehhhh my spells are sort of boring, sort of like a video game. fluffy , empty. \-death, dying, healing: i won't play by RAW 5e. I get the trend of tending toward near unlimited healing version to version but 5e raw makes for a very boring annoying games of players going unconscious constantly as they enter almost every fight fully healed unless you manipulate the world very strongly (unrealistically in many settings) to try to ""beat"" the players. the best recs i see is to hit players while they're down to kill them -- like ok that's really fun??? 3.5 was somewhat unforgiving, but I have struck a pleasant balance between the two in my homebrew rules. it's just not fun for me when character's going down is just another day in video game world d&amp;d. my players go down pretty rarely and when they do it' quite serious, not a DC 10 heal check to stabilize an dying unconscious person in 6 seconds... \-damage types: how boring that they removed ability damage and now psychic and poison damage are just... different forms of damage? death effects are almost totally gone and now just necrotic damage. absolutely no differences between damage types except for resistance, immunity, and vulnerability. this totally deprives such spells and abilities of their flavor. poison has always had the very unique compulsion of ability damage so you approach it with caution and preparation. now it's just silly in 5e imo. i have elemental damages have different damage distributions, poison and psychic damage are always ability damage, and it totally changes the play style and nature of such encounters, and which elemental spells and items character's use. i think 5e could really improve here without complicating the game and significant amount. \-monsters: major gripes with monster manual in 5e. I love the simplification, i love bounded accuracy and the number balance (it really failed at higher levels in 3.5), but this sort of falls in line with spells above. single monsters need their HP tripled or quadrupled at least. monster abilities disappeared or are altogether disappointing and non-scary. Ghouls used to terrify me in 3.5 and i loved that about them -- savvy characters could learn how dangerous one ghoul swipe could be (maybe you did research or talked around town beforehand, cause if you didn't you might run into something that kills everyone). Now you probably just get up the next round cause save every round and are not really that scared. Gelatinous cubes don't even paralyze you anymore, and in 3.5 they had a ridiculously high fortitude save cause you simply never touch one of those things period. Monsters are not very scary overall in their abilities. the numbers (which are critical for a game to be balanced) are better in 5e considering all levels of game play, but the actual monster abilities, descriptions, etc, were superior in 3.5. numbers are too flat by challenge rating in 5e, which makes it boring and predictable, and combined with insane healing by day encourages just running straight into every encounter. i don't enjoy that myself. so most of my monsters are homebrew or use 3.5 abilities. \-ability scores and saving throws: i've always believed all ability scores should be important, and characters should always be aware of their strengths AND weaknesses from game mechanics/house rules. 5e eschewed this principle even more than past editions--dex is more overpowered, int is a huge dump stat, even str can be argued a dump stat (average strength can carry 150lb unencumbered?). you can play with pitiful str and int and almost never notice. i've merged the two games such that there are fortitude, reflex, and will, and each have two ability score tied to them. i also never allow dex for damage, and have 6 knowledge skills, which in certain battles everyone must make to gain inspirtation dice to be used for that battle (or if you roll low the enemy can get inspiration against your character). i've doubled avg hit points rolled per level AND give an extra 10 at level 1 so that con is still a useful ability score, but it's not so devastating to have a penalty in it. sure enough one character opted for -1 con. And we notice it, but she's not so far behind other characters for it to be incredibly annoying and an almost universally ill-advised choice. In my homebrew, you will keenly feel strengths and weaknesses across all ability scores and characters and i love that. \-classes: 5e archeteypes are a great move and have tons of potential, though they haven't cleaned them up well. bard is overpowered and boring -- it's biggest strength lies literally in taking spells from other classes. they could have redone songs from 3.5 to make them interesting, fun, unique and useful (which i did in 3.5 -- current player chose bard only to say can you change it to be more like the bard that one guy played in college? i wanted a bunch of fun cool useful songs). The bard getting full spellcasting, super powerful abilities (many many d12 of inspiration/cutting words), and massive skill bonuses all around make it overpowered in my book and it's also just a weird mishmash of stuff (and not in a cool jack of all trades way), music isn't even that important for the class. the paladin's smite is dumb (in what world is it fun to save all of your smites for critical hits? i'm ok to let smites not be wasted if you miss -- but spamming smite crits is a recipe for unfun in my games). sorcerer needs more spells (now bard has more spells than sorcerer? ). DIvine casters still far too overpowered in their spellcasting (why does the cleric get so many necromancy spells the wizard doesn't?). they should be more like sorcerers or wizards, but not the best of both worlds and better combat. monks generally need a boost. lots of archetypes that are not appealing, which could have easily been fixed with a little more effort (bear totem outshines all others way too much for barbarian, for example. i like some of the cool abilities for martial classes a lot though, big improvemenet from 3.5. \-away from alignment-bound characters: sure ok i sort of get people's opinions and this last one may be a personal preference. I personally love the idea of good, evil, chaos and law being cosmic forces in the universe. I find that certain classes, like paladin and druid, were justifiably overpowered in old editions due only to their restrictive alignments and motives. 5e chose to weaken the restrictions but not the powers. in my homebrew world the cosmic forces of these alignments are very real and very important -- but of course everyone should play how they play. i've always thought that the whole idea was it's not the real world, we're not humanoids with biology, we live in a magical, cosmic world where the elements and these cosmic forces define us fundamentally. it's just always been fun to philosophize about with my players and never felt limiting in the slightest. maybe this is a DM thing. but i do believe there should be different kinds of paladins (aligning toward chaos, law, good or evil, but still restrictive within each choice). \-conclusions: 5e brought a lot of much needed changes, but some of the more video-gamey elements of spells and healing, and the overemphasis on making monsters and abilities more forgiving and easy to overcome has deprived the game of some of the essence of what makes it so fun, dynamic and interesting to me. Lots of great changes with proficiencies, archetypes, skills and bounded accuracy, but it is not the best it could be. and i would totally redo the bard class. overall, i'm so happy to see so many people playing the game, and that alone makes 5e fantastic--but i am always building toward my ""perfect"" roleplaying game. i learned D&amp;D from someone who played exclusively in the AD&amp;D era, so maybe i'm just a bit old school. curious what others think."
10,vulnerability,DnD,Aboleth/Cthulu style Vampires,1,ih7l9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ih7l9f/abolethcthulu_style_vampires/,2020-08-27 07:12:41,I'm looking to make a group of vampires who are more body horror mindfuckery style than the typical ones.

11,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrew Monster - Cursed Marionette: Looking for feedback,2,hkucbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/hkucbr/homebrew_monster_cursed_marionette_looking_for/,2020-07-04 10:42:01,"Hi all, I'm currently working on making some home brew monsters based on some of my favorite video games and was hoping to get some feedback. Currently I'm working on monsters from Castlevania and want to make a castlevania bestiary that I can release as a free pdf at some point. Here is one of my creations, the Cursed Marionette, which was inspired by the Marionette enemy from Castlevania Circle of the Moon. Hoping to get some feedback about the monster and any ways it could be better balanced or improved, and whether its CR seems right. In the game the marionette flies slowly and curses the player when touched, which is very troublesome in areas with other monsters. So the basic idea behind this home brew was to make a monster that is defensively pretty tough, with a good amount of HP and resistances, but is fairly weak in terms of damage and has an extremely slow movement speed. I designed it so that in a straight fight, it would be little more than a nuisance or a hazard, however the real danger it poses is its ability to bestow a nasty curse and it becomes much more bothersome when encountered in larger groups or if supporting other monsters. Anyway, Here are the Stats for the monster: **Cursed Marionette** Chaotic Evil Medium Construct (Demon) **AC** 14 (Natural Armor), **Hit Points** 40 (5d8 +18) **Speed:** 10ft (Flying) **Str** 6 (-2), **Dex** 14 (+2), **Con** 16 (+3), **Int** 10 (+0), **Wis** 12 (+1), **Cha** 17 (+3) **Damage Vulnerability:** Radiant **Damage Resistances:** Cold, Fire, Necrotic; Bludgeoning, piercing and slashing from non-magical attacks that aren't silvered. **Damage Immunity:** Poison **Condition Immunity:** Charmed, Exhausted, Frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned **Senses:** Passive Perception 11 **Challenge Rating**: CR 2 (Perhaps should be CR 1?) ***Anti-magic Susceptibility.*** The Cursed Marionette is incapacitated while in the area of an anti magic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the Cursed Marionette must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute. **Remove Curse Vulnerability.** If targeted by Remove Curse, the Cursed marionette must succeed on a constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or be destroyed. ***False Appearance.*** While the Cursed marionette remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal marionette, and can, at a distance, even be mistaken for an unconscious human woman. **Curse of Sloth.** A creature that fails the save against the Cursed Marionette's Cursed Caress is afflicted with a curse of sloth. A creature with this curse rolls disadvantage on initiative, Reflex saving throws and attacks. In addition, any time a creature with this curse attempts to take an action, they must pass a DC 12 wisdom save, if this save is failed, the creature takes no action and its turn ends immediately. **Actions** **Cursed Caress.** Melee weapon attack, +3, reach 5ft, 1 target, hit 1d8 - 2 Necrotic Damage. Any creature that takes damage from this attack must pass a DC 12 wisdom save or be afflicted with the Curse of Sloth. (Considering maybe even lowering the damage to be even less, since the point is low damage but nasty curse effect, maybe reduce damage to that of a CR 0 monster, and make the monster overall CR 1/2) Anyway, hope you'll like my home brew monster and happy to hear insight in to ways to improve the monster."

I can place all the other races some way or another, the one that I changed the most was the gnome making them the children swapped by the fay. The humans and dwarves remain the same, the human making highly concentrated settlement because thats the only way they have to survive in this dangerous world and the dwarves being this underground race that live in tight communities because the nature of their environment. Halflings have a symbiotic relation with humans and dwarves. Tieflings are the child born in the week of the purple moon when devils and demons wander freely in the material plane, like Halloween. Orcs are a tribal race that dont understand the concept of owning land, there are no half races in the setting. Lastly dragonborns are the mystery of the setting being tied to the disappearance of dragons. But I cant place elves. Personally I dont like them that much but they can make interesting PCs, especially when you lean to their long life, but they dont make sense as a society. So lets start with their traits, they have enhanced perception and darkvision, they have resistance to charm and cant be put to sleep, they dont need to sleep, they dont even have the moment of vulnerability that is sleeping, and they reach their physical maturity at 18 despite living for hundreds of years. That talk about a race of high survivability even when they are children (having less than 100 years). Then you have the sub races abilities, being it natural magic or being able to conceal themselves, which only make them more capable for survival. I dont get why they would develop a notion as family, and because that they wouldnt develop a need for society, which means no culture. If their children are capable of living in the wilderness without a problem, they wouldnt have the need to protect each other, which mean at the same time they wouldnt need to have a concept of ethics or goodness. Making a metaphor, the other races are wolves needing a great number to survive, while the elves are bears, only needing to take care of the young ones and then parting ways. So how can someone make the case of such powerful race forming any type of society when they can live on their own so easily. I know the way that forgotten realms handled that was to make them literally aliens, having their home in Arvandor, but I dont want that sort of answer. It might be helpful if you can share the way you guys have handled elves in your setting. TLDR; The elves are so powerful that they dont need to form any type of society to survive, so I struggle to make a settlement for them in the setting."

Half-Orc for savage attacks. Charisma should start at 14 or 15. Warlock 9. Hexblade patron and pact of the blade. Pick booming blade cantrip and banishing smite spell from the expanded spell list. Take eldritch smite and superior pact weapon invocations. Use both ASIs to increase Charisma. Cleric 6. Grave domain for path to the grave channel divinity, which gives vulnerability to all damage from the next attack. The rest of the levels are used to end up a 7th level caster by the end of the build. Use the ASI to max out Charisma Rogue 3. 2d6 sneak attack + assassinate from the assassin archetype. Paladin 2. As a 7th level caster with a 4th level spell slot, divine smite is now it's maximum 5d8. The setup and the math Be sure that you can surprise the enemy. 1 action to use path of the grave and a bonus action for hexblades curse. On the next turn, bonus action to cast banishing smite and the attack. Booming blade against surprised target using a rapier as the pact weapon. Attack roll: +5[Cha mod] +6[Prof bonus] +2[superior pact weapon] = +13 total bonus and advantage.

One wealthy family has invited them - as reward for a great service - to one of their famed house parties, and I'm looking for ways to: A) Give the players a fun time with some magically themed food/drink. B) Impress upon the players just how obscenely wealthy these people are, that they can afford to give away these magical items to a party of dozens/hundreds (think a Great Gatsby-style party). Some of the ideas for wacky foods and drinks I've come up with, or seen posted here in the past, include: - Polymorph Puff Pastries: A light, flaky treat that, for one round, polymorphs you into a harmless CR 1/2 or below creature. Six seconds later, you return to your normal form - this table is carefully watched by house security to prevent anyone from being transformed and kidnapped, attacked, or otherwise mistreated during their brief stint of vulnerability. - Zone of Truth Shots: A small glass of fire-y green liquid that subjects you to a Zone of Truth spell, Charisma Save - DC 13. The fun part about this one is that, in a social setting, none of the people around you will know if you succeeded or failed your throw. So they can ask you questions and see how you respond - and maybe you're being forced to be truthful, or maybe you're pulling one over on them, which leads to some fun party intrigue. - Reduce/Enlarge Wraps: Bacon-wrapped bits of local meat that have either a one-round Enlarge or one-round Reduce spell baked in. Which one will you get? For large-ceiling rooms only. - Shots of Hideous Laughter: Fruity orange shots that subject you to a DC 15 Wisdom Saving Throw, else you fall to the ground writhing with laughter for six seconds. - Calm Emotions Cupcake: For use after the Shots of Hideous Laughter. This baked treat does not subject anyone around you to the effect, but brings a steady calm to anyone who consumes it, ending charm/frighten effects and generally allowing you to re-experience the highs of one of the other glorious goods at the table. - Many-Tongues Mead: A spicy drink that briefly switches your speech from Common to a random language determined by the DM. This effect wears off after one minute, during which YOU perceive yourself as speaking in Common, but everyone else around you hears Infernal, Celestial, Draconic, or something similarly obscure. You can only understand people who reply in the language that is chosen. Obviously, some important caveats come with these sorts of fun party tricks: First, make sure your players are entirely on board with the notion of consent. A party of this nature is heavily watched and no one wants to be fed something they didn't intend to consume; anyone who spikes another's food or drink with any of these items is immediately removed from the premises and has a powerful new enemy to contend with. Second, as a DM, you may want to make sure there's an effect that disappears magical food or drink if taken off manor grounds. Or...you may not. It entirely depends on the level of chaos you're comfortable with in your game. But what other ideas am I missing? What other funny, scandalous, humiliating, Alice-in-Wonderland-style shenanigans would fabulously wealthy people get up to with their food and drink at a lavish, Gatsby-esque party? I want to brainstorm additional ideas - hit me!"

And also still keep the flavor from the Zelda universe? And secondly for Koroks and Deku Scrubs as player characters, being plant people giving them vulnerability to fire damage would make sense. But I feel that would be too unbalanced. Instead, would giving them disadvantage on saving throws for fire damage feel like an acceptable option? I know 5e generally tries to stay away from racial penalties, but there are a few examples like sunlight sensitivity.

The campaign has been strange. We started out with two players and a DM. Are characters started at level 15 so we got into some high level shenanigans. The rulers for the character creation was everything out of the book and homebrew if the DM allowed it. The other player is playing a level 5 rouge (I think assassin) and a level 10 plainswalker (a plainswalker is a homebrew class the DM found on D&amp;D Beyond) and I am playing a 15th level elementalist wizard. The elementalist is a subclass from Midagard Hero's Handbook by Kobald Press. My character was a lightning elementalist so he had the ability to change a spells damage type to your specialized damage type, leets say there have been a couple of times where a giant ball of lightning falls out of the sky (fire ball). The elemntalist has one ability that they can get at 10th level called elemental erosion which was the ability that has messed up the campaign the most. Elemental erosion says something like, after you damage a creature with a spell that dose your chosen damage type, you may give that creature vulnerability to that damage type until the end of your next turn, you can use this ability 3 times a long rest. Combined with the elemental bulwark ability which allowed me to always ignore resistance and the 14th level ability which allowed me to ignore immunity 3 times a day. Along with that my character was a fire genasi and had max INT, and max CON plus the tough feat and a manual of bodily health. The DM also allowed a rare, uncommon, and very rare magic Item. My character also started with a lot of money and he was at the max Renown in his guild (Izzet). In the end of character creation I had 2 bags of holding because why not, bracers of defense, a cloak of displacement and a staff of power. He also allowed us a homebrew magic item that can be of any power level, but thats for later. My combat would go something like. Action cast crown of stars (7 bonus action glowing balls of energy that can be thrown 120 as an attack as a bonus action, no concentration. It normal dose radient damage but not is dose lightning!), bonus action fling a ball because why not? Survive a turn by using the rouge as a meet shield most of the time and taking advantage of the fire and lightning resistance. Next turn, bonus action ball a ball and hit with my attack of like +12, give it vulnerability and then throw a chaos bolt at like 6th level. Let's just say that most combats didn't last that long. Then it became more fun as one of my friends joined the campaign. He joined as a tiefling blood sorcerer (the blood sorcerer is a homebrew subclass were you get a d12 hit die now and you use your hit points. It was kinda broken, if you want to check it out then its on D&amp;D beyond) Rakdos obviously. So after he joined the group, the Boros guild hall exploded partial because of us and some other stuff as well. Next we killed Nicho Bolas with some luck sword and shenanigans and a teleporting dagger (the wish was I wish for 3 more luck blades with wishes) the DM was nice and let that happened. After like a month of this stuff we are now level 17 and I now have access to my final form. I forget what the rouge did but me and the sorcerer now have access to 9th level spells, I did NOT pick wish, instead I got shape-change and meteor swarm. Okey, now remember the custom magic items, yea we did two now. The rouge just got some daggers that made some fog, cool. The Sorcerer got an Artifact called the Greater Talisman of the Sphere. It was like the normal talisman of the sphere except, it was greater, and able to summon small 3 inch spheres of annihilation. Sense it was smaller we made a DC to avoid being sucked into the sphere but it didn't really matter, it was still a sphere of annihilation. Great now it was my turn. I decided to make the bracers of Greater forms (it replaced my bracers of defense). It allows me to cast shapechange 2 extra times a day and I get to keep all class features and magic item abilities. Now, first time testing out these magic items, and 9th level spells this campaign. So the bad guy is burning down the Selesnya guild hall. He is at the top of the big tree. He then sees an adult blue dragon flying up to him caring a tiefling and a shadowy figure. Villain monolog time, talks about how he learned form the last time we sent his but flying. He now has a ring of lightning resistance (The DM forgot my ability again after I showed him it 3 times and he even asked me for the ability). The character became less confident when threw a crown of stars at him and then blasted him with like 270 lightning damage. Now he dives of the tree and meats his friend who then casts dimension door, but he doesn't because counter-spell, did I mention that yet? I have also been casting that spell the hole time, the sorcerer also knows counter spell. Cool we now have messed up the DM's plan as we were not supposed to capture that guy. Next session we find ourselves in an anti-magic dungeon that we were ""trapped"" in. We then had a long debate about what would happen if you had a sphere of annihilation in the anti-magic field. This was his last attempt at keeping the game generally on track, after the utter fails at combat and this, we have now officially broken the DM. We have put a pause on that game and for the past 3 weeks we have been playing Blades in the Dark a heist RPG game. Who knows if we are going back to that game. I hope you thought the story was good and i might have gotten a couple of the facts wrong but its at least pretty close."

Especially since we have another cleric in the party, I was planning on being mostly Rogue--- probably a final tally of Rogue 13/Cleric 7--- probably taking a slightly reskinned version of the UA Revived subclass. However, this is the second character I've ever played, and the first multiclass, so I have no idea how I should stack the levels--- my first thought had been to take all 7 of Cleric before moving back to Rogue, but I didn't want to wait until almost halfway through the game to improve my Rogue abilities. My current plan is to take the second Cleric level for Path of the Grave (which gives a creature vulnerability to the damage of the next attack against it), and then all of the Rogue up to level 13, and then back to Cleric for the last 5 levels (assuming we get that far, of course).

Our party was playing Curse of Strahd tonight. There are light spoilers here. Unfortunately, my 21 AC cleric of life goes down a lot in combat. He's not the best tank in the party. But he can certainly take some hits. Recently, I've been working on a strategy: Turn 1: Ray of Frost and Spirit weapon (SW). Turn 2: Spiritual guardians and attack with SW. Turn 3: Ray of Frost then Sanctuary, at which point I will begin healing the better tanks in the party. But I haven't been able to pull it off since conceiving it. We were at a boss fight last session and I started implementing this strategy. I get to turn 2. The Spiritual guardians goes up and does only 9 damage to the boss. For reference, I'm 9th level and I have greater than 2/3s health (but my d8s suck). The DM then targets me with a 3rd level spell, and three attacks from the boss. Every enemy that was physically able to attack me (even ones not inside the guardian's radius) turned on me once the Spirit guardians was up. I managed to hold onto my concentration until the end, but I go down. But that was kinda a tipping point for things in this campaign, so I talked to the DM one-on-one afterward. I mentioned 3 complaints \- I felt like I was targeted that round. I brought up that every turn, I had been using my movement to move away from the enemies so I could get this up, and that 2 turns before I died that I had specifically mentioned that I was going behind the barbarian to put him in between me and the boss/their minions. The barbarian, on his turn before my death, dealt 46 damage to the boss. I did 9 with an AOE spell. \- The DM gives items to characters preferentially. Yes, it is CoS so I understand the fortune cards, but whenever we come across any other magic item, if I feel like it would help my character, then I would ask if I can have it. Mainly, there are a couple items that boost saving throws. As a caster who needs concentration and as someone who dies to Strahd's fireballs a lot (my DM gave me fire vulnerability so I still get one-shot by fireballs if I fail the save), that would be helpful. However, whenever I ask for a magic item, the DM (and occassionally party members) tell me that, ""Oh no. This item was meant for \_\_\_\_\_\_. Or, ""it's perfect for \_\_\_\_\_'s character skills"". The only magic items I've gotten all game are two spell scrolls, both of which I am the only player who can cast them, and they are both spells that I have auto-prepared as a cleric of life anyways. A similar thing happens with events in the game. After the session is over, the DM will often tell a character that he ""built that part for him"". \- I am someone who enjoys interacting with the NPCs of the world. However, the two NPCs that I tried to build connections with within the world, whenever I would talk to them won't give me the time of the day. One of them the DM just ignores me if I say that I want to go talk to them, so I have now been just resigned to mention it as my downtime in that city. Only one other party member really interacts with NPCs, but whenever he does, the DM gets very enthusiastic. When I asked the DM what he thought about these concerns and what he thought might help them be less of an issue the DM mocked me and said that he probably should just never attack my character again. Did I make the right move to leave the campaign? I hate leaving a game since games are hard to come by for me right now. This is my first time through CoS, so I also hate the feeling that now this campaign is ruined for me since now I know a significant portion of the encounters etc. I guess it's just nice to rant this here, but I feel like I did all I could do talking to the DM..."

Essentially immortal, golems have long since figured out the mechanical secrets of their own creation, and without the control of the society that created them, they have become sentient. Usually crafted from fine clay, though occasionally carved from stone or cast from iron, each golem is a work of art and statuary to be admired. Their animating energy comes from a magical scroll writ with the words that guide their existence, most importantly since their own independence is the sentence THINE MASTER IS THINE OWN MIND, though typically their parent or creator will have additional words inscribed that guide their offspring's development. At their coming of age ceremony, when a golem has been judged to be mature and educated on the nature of the world sufficiently to care for themself, a golem is able to add some more words to their chem (the name for the scroll that animates them) that will be the guiding provisions for their future. It is important to note that while the amount of words a chem can hold is limited they can be reasonably freely changed. Being a stone golem gives +2 strength and +2 constitution but inflicts a -1 to intelligence and -1 to dexterity. A movement speed of 20ft, vulnerability to cold, and resistance to lightning, and resistance to falling damage. A stone golem has 12+dex modifier for its natural armor. Being a clay golem given +2 to intelligence and +2 to constitution. It inflicts a -1 to dexterity, and a -1 to charisma. A movement speed of 30ft, a vulnerability to lightning, resistance to fire, and resistance to falling damage. A clay golem has 10+dex for its natural armor. Being an Iron Golem gives +2 to Strength and constitution, and inflicts a -1 to charisma and intelligence. A movement speed of 25ft, vulnerability to fire, resistance to cold, resistance to falling damage. An Iron golem has 14+dex for its natural armor but cannot wear other physical armor. All golems can breath underwater but move at  speed underwater instead of half. In melee a golem deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage if unarmed. A golem lives technically forever so age is more or less irrelevant to them, as such they do not count the years. A golem looms above normal humanoids at between 7  and 8  feet tall. Golems do not have a gender as such, though individual golems may adopt a masculine or feminine or neutral personality."

So, here it is. A few things to note. 1)For most things on the list, when the Wild Sorc in the party rolls on something, I don't tell them what it is, I just describe what happens. In the instance of something like #100, I say nothing happens and then I wait until his character speaks (that is one I ran by the entire party prior to adding it, and it's been one of my favorites that he's rolled more than once). 2)Whenever a Wild Surge is rolled, after the game I change the option, though there are a few favorites that I have that I keep. I may also change the placement on the table in case anyone is trying to track them. I may also keep one depending on the reaction of the party, example being ""a horse appears that is just on fire"". It's been one of the funniest ones that was rolled, as it happened during the middle of combat and the horse in its panic knocked out one of their enemies. Then it died. 3)We play with custom rules. Whenever he rolls for a Wild Surge, but it doesn't occur, his chance goes up by 1 on the die. It keeps going until a Wild Surge occurs. This does not reset on a long rest, the idea is that the characters magic needs that extra release as it keeps building over time. 1. Roll on this table once per round for 1 minute 2. Caster and target switch positions after spell 3. Can see invisible creatures for 1 hour 4. A flaming horse appears (not a Nightmare, a real horse) 5. A modron appears within 5ft for 1 minute 6. Caster explodes with Plant Growth 7. Cast Fireball, centered on self, at 3rd level 8. Non magical weapons in a 60ft radius turn to food for 1 minute 9. Cast Magic Missile at 5th level, each beam at a random creature within the spells range 10. Caster breathes 30ft fire cone the next time they speak 11. Change height by 1d10; Even, taller, Odd, shorter 12. Target is cocooned in crystal until someone breaks it 13. Cast Confusion centered on self 14. Cast Thunderwave centered on self 15.

Suggestions please,1,hcm72h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/hcm72h/complex_and_interesting_cursed_magic_items/,2020-06-20 23:21:07,"5e player for years but new DM here, running two simultaneous campaigns both in the same setting. LMoP and DIP blend with a flavoring of home brew here and there. One thing I want to incorporate before the party gets too high of a level (getting access to level 3 spells) is cursed magical items. The idea would be to have two cursed items infect the party and then they come across a single scroll of remove curse. The idea is both cursed items are of equal inconvenience/ threat to the party. So they have to make a choice who to use the scroll on. And even then the check might fail casting a scroll above level and no one gets fixed. They are level two atm and will be level 3 very soon. I was thinking of giving a berserker axe to the fighter with average wisdom but Im trying to figure out another equivalent cursed magical item. But honestly official material they are limited. I didnt want something overpowered like an artifact and I dont want to have something they can easily ignore like stone of ill luck or circumvent like armor of vulnerability by just avoiding the danger. Any thoughts on a home brew moderately helpful magical benefit but also a dangerous curse that has potential to harm the party to make the scroll choice all that more important and difficult. Thoughts?"

Things like drinking ourselves to sleep, sneaking off to dig through the dumpster behind the inn, or sharing intimate moments with our favorite NPCs. One of our players found a FULL Deck of Many Things (DoMT) a few sessions back and hadnt done anything with it yet. Earlier in the session we arrived in a new town and visited a seedy pleasure palace to meet a drug lord NPC for upcoming quests. At the end of our session tonight, myself and another player had decided to unwind in character by taking drugs and bonding over shared trauma. From a certain perspective it was pretty wholesome, as our PCs were sharing a lighthearted bit of vulnerability that previously seemed impossible. Thats when our Wizard suggested we play a card game, producing the DoMT and suggesting we play a game - confessing that theyd never played before. My character is particularly horny, and suggested that we play strip poker with the cards. The look on our DMs face was priceless. She let us each draw a card - the wizard got a magical weapon, and I drew a mystery card that didnt do anything obvious. So of course, my PC insisted that they draw another. Immediately, my soul was ripped from my body and sent into a crystal ball surrounded by endless flames - not as the result of the drugs- but in a very literal sense. Honestly, this is one of the best sessions Ive ever played. Before this happened, we had already laughed ourselves to tears several times. Huge props to my DM for rolling with the punches and letting us be our chaotic, goofy selves. Between the sheer escapism and sharing so much quality time with my friends, its hard to think of a better pastime. TLDR: At the tale end of a particularly chaotic and goofy session our PCs got high and decided to play strip poker with the Deck of Many Things. MRW I get sent directly to hell instead of getting lucky."
28,vulnerability,DnD,"a D&amp;D 5e campaign starting idea, involving an exotic twist on things.",0,hhpax8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/hhpax8/a_dd_5e_campaign_starting_idea_involving_an/,2020-06-29 09:57:01,"hello r/DnD GMs! I got an idea for a type of campaign you don't see often. it's going to have a LOT of holes, considering i only have 2 campaigns under my belt and have never GMed before (but was about to until COVID happened), but I'll rely on you to fill them. # the DMPC(who can be a normal pc) why do i start with something that should be reserved for when the party is getting spanked to death by awakened bushes? because it's crucial to the story, and I may have built this concept from the ground up around this character. **overview** the character is a male red dragon wyrmling named ruby, and and his scales are bright red with a glimmer very faintly in a couple of arias. he suffers from major depression and self-loathing, which obstructs his morality and his kind nature (while also obstructing everything bad about being a red dragon). he is a far cry from a normal red dragon **backstory** being a chromatic dragon, ruby had to come from somewhere. his egg was laid by a female adult red dragon who was close to transitioning into the ancient age class. he was newly laid when adventurers wandered in, seeking to claim her treasure and stop her from terrorizing the nearby city and villages. after a big fight, and some other hijinks like flirting with kobolds gone wrong, they discover the egg and promptly sell it to a merchant for a bag of holding and a ring of regeneration after the party's bard releases he banged their mother. the merchant goes along, and then sells the egg to a lord who's sense of morality and understanding of dragons is off. his wife, who excels at what her husband lacks and then some, divorces him and takes the egg (the divorce was planned for a year after the wife caught him cheating). the egg hatches, and the woman(who is human, should've said that earlier, and I'll call Mary) raises him the best she can, after a very rough start. he became a local celerity in the village as Mary didn't keep him a secret in the slightest. she was able to teach him many things for 12 years, like how to speak common, and his scales began to show for it. everything changed, as the city was leveled by an ancient blue dragon and it's army. there where few survivors, and they were scattered far. ruby was one of the few, but Mary was not. ruby, having lost his foster mother, tried to move on, but life is hard when when you are a dragon who's species has a reputation. being used to everyone accepting him and being basically a child, he walked into a small town and was nearly killed. the town hunted him, and he learned why they hated him. he began to hate himself, and you can probably guess where this is going. **class and stats** (this is if you want to have all your players to start at level 1)he has no class, yet, and because he doesn't have a class, he starts out without any items. he's basically a regular red dragon wyrmling with a sense of morality. ruby starts off at level 0, with -3000 xp (only gaining HALF xp, you can remove this if you want). when he eventually does become level 1, he doesn't know how to fly, and cant carry any medium race on his back anyway. also one can make the excuse that he uses his breath weapon as a flash light. being a red dragon in a world that fears red dragons, the party has to be carful when entering a town. people will be very hostile to the shy poor wyrmling, and so will any goodly being except dragonborn. not even beings of neutrality evil will be kind, as evil will want to take advantage of his vulnerability and manipulate him wile neutrals will shun him. still op? wait until you see his special gimmick will possibly shackle him, HARD. **his special gimmick** like I said earlier, he is majorly depressed. he starts out with 4 mental health, and has a threshold of 25. ***if it reaches 0, he will commit suicided.*** at his start, he will refuse to even move. at 5 and lower mental health, he will refuse to attack, no matter what, and will refuse to eat at 6 or lower. at 10 mental health, he won't be too so depressed that he will refuse to learn things again, and will actually begin to value his life a little. at 15, he begins to accept himself wile holding back his primal urges, and I forgot to mention that lower than that will give dis-advantage to insight checks and charisma saving throws. the player should roll a constitution check every day/long rest to see how moody ruby is (DC: 11-con). at 20-25 mental health, the depression appears to be gone, but if he falls out of the threshold, his mental health will be dropkicked to 12. he also takes double mental health damage. if he reaches above 25, he must stay above that for an in-game week. if he does, say goodbye to this gimmick as he is no longer depressed. *what affects this gimmick?* being an introverted virgin, I cannot say everything. i can, however, give the example of being left behind. damaging or healing his mental health is also not straightforward, as you have to roll to see if it's affected, also there is temporary and permanent mental health damage. in order for his mental health to be affected, you must roll. if you roll lower than an 8 to accept heal or higher than an 13 to resist harm, then the mental health is not affected. if it's anywhere between 8-13 for both to harm and heal, then they get it temporarily for 2 days. it's the opposite of unaffected threshold in order to deal permanent, but crit fails/success do double. *his mental health can only be affected by 1 normally.* **personal recommendation** I recommend that you give this PC to a willing player, preferably to one who is/has dealt with depression/self loathing, and you let them know what you are about to give them. I also recommend that you urge them into being a front-line class. # campaign things. I know the majority of this post is ruby, but I promised campaign ideas. everyone, except ruby, meets up in a small town's tavern, where they greet each other's characters. they're supposed to overhear some gossip (or you can be inventive) about strange noises happening in the nearby woods. they're supposed to go into the woods, and discover ruby who is crying and is ok with dying but doesn't want to do it himself. after some time, and hearing about and doing a low level dungeon as a therapy of sorts, a cult member of Teamont (did i spell it correctly?), possibly the BBEG of the campaign, will ""join"" the party, only to attempt to assassinate them and attempt to manipulate ruby. this cult is HUGE, and has their tentacles in most major cities. this is the big hole, as what happens next I cannot say. what I can though is when they confront the cult leader and nearly defeating the frail old man, he will summon Teamont, who follows through with the summoning mostly because of ruby and his use as chromatic dragon with a good reputation. this will only be one of her avatars, however."

We are playing through LMoP and I decided to make some changes. Instead of Venomfang, the party will be going against a night hag and some shadows (she won't be immediatly hostile towards the party and they can get out without having to fight). The party will be lvl 2, or even 3 by the time they reach Thundertree. Between her minions I decided to put some kind of blood monster (I made a map with a little prison and there is a blood pool in a cell with a statue on it). I didn't find anything online so I decided to homebrew something. Here's what came out. &amp;#x200B; # Blood Ooze Medium Ooze, unaligned **Armor Class** 8; **Hit points** 30 (4d8+12); **Speed** 10 ft., climb 10 ft. **STR** 12 **DEX** 6 **CON** 16 **INT** 1 **WIS** 6 **CH**A 2 **Skills**: Stealth +2; **Damage Vulnerabilities**: necrotic; **Damage Immunities**: lighting, slashing; **Condition Immunities**: blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, prone; **Senses**: blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 8; **CR**: ? **Amorphous**: The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. **False Appearence**: While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a blood pool. **ACTIONS** **Pseudopod**: melee attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d6+1) bludgeoning, plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. **REACTIONS** **Split**: When an ooze that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new oozes if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new ooze has hit points equal to half the original ooze's, rounded down. New oozes are one size smaller than the original ooze. &amp;#x200B; Basically I took an Ochre Jelly and a Grey Ooze and put them toghether, trying to add something new (necrotic damage instead of acid, since I think that blood should ""sicken"" the targets, and necrotic vulnerability to help the party and also because since blood is something ""living"" it should be more affected by necrotic damage). What do you think? Will the party wipe it out in a round? Will it be a TPK (the hag will use this and some other shadow-minions to gain some time to escape if she start to loose, and use only one Shadow during the fight)? What CR should it be (I know there are tables and rules to calculate it, but I didn't understand them really well)? Any help in bettering this monster will be really helpful. I want my players to have fun."

Channel Divinity Rebuke the Violent: You can use your Channel Divinity to rebuke those who use violence. Immediately after an attacker within 30 feet of you deals damage with an attack against a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker takes radiant damage equal to the damage it just dealt. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. So if the Barbarian is raging and is dealt 20 slashing damage from an attack (reduced to 10) and i use my Channel Divinity, does it do up to 20 or up to 10 damage? It comes down to the question wether there is a terminological difference between dealing damage (output of the monsters attack) and taking damage (input of how many hp the target of this attack loses). The PHB section about damage resistance and vulnerability does not answer this."

Mine was gonna be a Gourd Leshy and I was gonna take LawfulGoodRogue's Otherworldly Color Patron Warlock. I love the concept and the Gourd Leshy has good, compatible ability scores boosts and and racial traits for playing warlocks. The problem is I gave my leshy race a bunch of good bonuses so to balance things out and keep things thematic I gave them fire vulnerability. This seems pretty dangerous as a low level character so I am entertaining other builds and concepts. This is not a post asking for is my Gourd Leshy Otherworldly Color Warlock balanced or optimal. Instead it is me asking for cool homebrew and 3pp ideas. If you have played a fun homebrew or 3pp class or race and enjoyed it, what was it? Why did you like it? If you have made a cool homebrew race or class, sell me on it.

Not much is known about this type of magic, but what is known tells us about its power to manipulate feelings, substance and form. Some old documents also speak about its negative effect on the user itself as well as others, thus the name Negative Magic comes. Some scripts also mention this magic with name Infitimancy, which roughly means magic of reversing, magic of opposition, magic of negativity. Changing base of magic to its opposite form. Negative in Latin - negativus, infitialis, abdicativus Possible attributes - rejection, reforming, brief alteration, feeling manipulation, turning into opposite. Other forms of magic - Abjuration, Transmutation, Evocation, Enchantement, Illusion, Divination, Conjuration, Necromancy, Onomancy, Dunemancy. \-Mancy, -Ation, -Ement. Possible Names - Infiti-mancy, Infiti-ation, Infit-ement Name choice - Infitimancy (magic), Infitimancer (wizard). Main spell ideas: 1. To change someone's feelings towards someone or something. 2. Change the type of a spell to its opposite. For example - Fire to Cold, or Radiant to Nectoritc 3. Change resistance or immunity to its opposite. For example - Fire immunity to fire vulnerability. Incase of resistance, when its 50% damage, it can be altered so target takes 150% Resistance - Full damage is 24, but taken 12 Altered - Full damage is 24, but taken 36. Its not full 2x (48) damage but still quite rough. Thus implementing a new word? **Submission** \- when the creature is slightly more affected to type but not fully vulnerable. 4. Changing creatures' overall mental and physical state. Targeting game mechanics and changing ability modifiers. For example - Constitution 18 (+4), changing +4 to -4. 5. Adding new type of damage alongside already existing ones - Negative Type Damage. This type of damage targets creatures feelings and emotions, while psychic damage targets mind and physical - body. Note\* - will be working on subclasses as well, probably for any class that may be good with this idea. Also every spell is still work in progress and are of Infitimancy school.

Their story goes along the lines of, the scholar planning to kill the warrior, after seeing the bloodlust that lay within her as as the warrior turned to be both a sadist, and murderer, the warrior, after a recent victory and partying, not able to resist the urge to slit the throats of her compatriots as they slept, only to be interrupted by the scholar, who had set up wards and curses, forbidden spells she stolen by her. Which one of the sisters won the fight, is unknown, as both remember killing the other, and as twins, they cant tell who's body it is. In concept, they are ment to often try to seize control of each other during combat, or moments of vulnerability. Their body disrupted enough, causing more often forced control. Typically, it would be a fighter/wizard, but I feel multiclassing wizards is counter-intuitive to the class, so I ask if anyone has any other ideas, and if not, a fighter/wizard build that fits the theme with being viable, with the fighter preferably not going eldritch if possible.

40,vulnerability,DnD,Optimizing the master of moments epic destiny from 4e: Summoner Druid,1,gqkm8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gqkm8d/optimizing_the_master_of_moments_epic_destiny/,2020-05-26 08:19:31,"Over the years, I made and read many char optimization builds for D&amp;D 4e but I've never seen one that made good use of master of moments. Long Story short, the main benefit from this ED comes from it's level 21 feature: You can spend an action point to gain a standard + move + minor action instead of just one extra action. Also, it's level 24 feature gives you an extra minor action per round + the ability to convert two minor actions into a move one if you wish. So, the best way to create a super optimized character with this ED is by having ways to attack many times using minor actions. And I find that the Druid class is a premier pick for this by using this build: Race: Half Elf Theme: Sarifal Feywarden (D405) Background: Starting Scores post racial bonuses 12 14 16 10 18 08 Final Scores 14 18 22 12 26 10 Class features Wild Shape Primal Predator &amp;#x200B; At will Powers: Fire Hawk (PP) Magic Stones (HotF) Savage Rend (Beast Form, PHB2) &amp;#x200B; Encounter Powers: lvl 01 - Thorn Spray (PP) lvl 03 - Predator's Flurry (PHB2)/ Tundra Wind (PHB2)/ Wind Wall (HotF)/ Quills (HotF) lvl 07 - Charm Beast (HotF) lvl 13 - Claws of Retribution (PHB2)/ Floating Death (PP)/ Rending Claws (PP) lvl 17 - Infiltrating Drone (D389)/ Rolling Earth (HotF)/ Center the Vortex (HotF)/ Cloud of Sparrows (PP)/ Searing Winds (HotF) lvl 23 - Grasping Earth (PHB2)/ Blinding Swarm (PP)/ Ice Spikes (HotF)/ Fungal Eruption (D386) lvl 27 - Cast in Stone (HotF)/ Leaping Rake (PHB2)/ Disorienting Drone (PP)/ Barrage of Lightning (HotF) &amp;#x200B; Daily Powers: Lvl 01 - Summon Giant Toad (PP)/ Sumon Pack Wolf (PP) lvl 05 - Vine Serpents (PP)/ Wall of Thorns (PHB2)/ Roar of Terror (PHB2)/ Destructive Harvest (HotFK) lvl 09 - Primal Wolf (PHB2)/ Summon Crocodile (PP)/ Entangle (PHB2)/ Sunbeam (PHB2) or another level 5 power lvl 15 - Summon Lightning Drake (PP) lvl 19 - A power from another level or maybe Summon Guardian Briar (PP)/ Primal Lion (D382) lvl 25 - Writhing Henge (HotF) lvl 29 - Summon Storm Behemoth (PP)/ Summon Elder Pack Wolf (PP) &amp;#x200B; Utility Powers: lvl 02 - Verdant Bounty (PP)/ Sudden Bite (PP)/ Warding Wind (PP)/ Cat's Grace (HotFK)/ Bear's Strength (HotFK)/ Elk's Fortitude (HotFK) lvl 06 - Camouflage Cloak (PHB2)/ Eagle's Splendor (HotFK)/ Serpent's Cunning (HotFK)/ Swarm Dispersal (PP)/ Rodent's Agility (PP)/ Leaf Wall (HotFK) lvl 10 - Animal Clan (PP)/ Clear the Chaff (HotFK)/ Feywild Sojourn (PHB2)/ Good Berry (PP/HotFK) lvl 16 - Elusive Wind (PP)/ Falcon's Flight (HotFK)/ Wall of Stone (PHB2)/ Insightful Riposte (Skill power PHB3) lvl 22 - Protective Whirlwind (PP)/ Wall of the World (HotF)/ Stonebones (PP)/ Touch of Renewal (HotFK) &amp;#x200B; Feats: \* means retrain at lvl Heroic Tier - lvl 01 - Hafted Defense (PHB3) \* 12 lvl 02 - Staff Expertise (HotFL) lvl 04 - Vicious/Distant Advantage (PHB3/PHB2) \* 11 lvl 06 - Action Surge (PHB) lvl 08 - Superior Will (HotFL/HotFK) lvl 10 - Improved Defenses (HotFL/HotFK) &amp;#x200B; Paragon Tier - lvl 11 - Lasting Fronst and Wintertouched (PHB) lvl 12 - Shield Proficiency, light and Shield Specialization (PHB) lvl 14 - Quick Wild Shape (PHB2) lvl 16 - Shield Mastery (PHB3) \* 22 lvl 18 - Pouncing Form (PP) \* 21 lvl 20 - Disciplined Talent (MC Psion PHB3), required for master of moments &amp;#x200B; Epic Tier - lvl 21 - Primal Summoning Expertise (PP) and Primal Resurgence (PHB2) lvl 22 - Second Skin (PP) and Epic Fortitude(PHB2) lvl 24 - Epic Resurgence (PHB) lvl 26 - Skill Power (PHB3) for Insightful Riposte (PHB3) lvl 28 - Wild Surge (PP) lvl 30 - Superior Initiative (PHB3) &amp;#x200B; Paragon Path: Primal Summoner (PP) Epic Destiny: Master of Moments (PsP) &amp;#x200B; Notable Equipment: Implement/Weapon - Frost Weapon (PHB) Armor - Arm - Feet - Hand - Head - Neck - Ring - Ring of Free Time (AV2) Waist - Miscellaneous/Wondrous items - &amp;#x200B; Acronyms: PHB - Player's Handbook; D - Dragon magazine; PP - Primal Power; PsP - Psionic Power; HotF - Heroes of the Feywild; HotFL - Heroes of the Fallen Lands; HotFK - Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms; AV - Adventurer's Vault. What makes this build possible and devastating is the epic tear feat, Primal Summoning Expertise. It allows you to use a minor action to give a standard action command to your Primal Summons. The paragon path is also focused on summoning, giving you a standard action command to your summon as a free action when you spend an action point. The lvl 11 encounter gives extra damage to your summons attacks and the daily lvl 20 is another (and good) summon. The feat Primal Resurgence lets you regain the use of a primal daily power once a day when you get bloodied. So, starting at level 21, you will have one summon daily per encounter (assuming 5 encounters a day) and for the encounters you use an action point, you get 4 extra actions out of it that can all be used for attacking. At lvl 24 you get an extra minor action per round and near the end of the adventure, at lvl 29, the ring of free time gives you another minor action per encounter/ per round after a milestone. That's 3 standards + 2 moves + 2-4 minors when you action point. The cherry on top is that the Druid also has some of the best summons of all 4th Edition. The best one being the lvl 25 Writhing Henge,which should be the one you get an extra use per day. It summons 6 tendrils with reach. They are limited to each attacking a different enemy on your standard action command, but it's intrinsic effect (When you don't give it any command on your turn) can make them all focus fire a single target. The intrinsic effect is balanced around the fact you are forced to give the standard attack command as part of the summon (So it can only activate the following turn, maybe) but this build can work around that. The level 10 daily utility (Animal Clan) allows you to once per round use a minor action to force your summon to use it's intrinsic effect, essentially giving you an Hexa attack per round. The master of moments ED also has a level 26 utility that let's you freeze a target in time until the end of your next turn after you hit it. Summon the tendrils against a solo+ attack a few times with one of them + freeze the target in time +give no commands to the tendrils next turn = They all attack on their own the moment the enemy leaves the time stasis. The other Summons you will keep in your final build include the Lightning Drake (has AOE ataccks), your paragon path daily that constantly shifts and changes sizes when you command it to attack and either the storm behemoth for more AOE attacks or the Elder pack wolf that annoys a single target more. This build uses the frost cheese combo of a frost weapon + the feats lasting frost and wintertouched in order to get permanent combat advantage + some extra damage. The Sarifal Feywarden theme ups your damage even further with an encounter aura 2 that gives enemies 5/10/15 vulnerability to your attacks of a chosen element until the end of your next turn. Great for nova turns and gives + 1 power bonus fortitude. Although This build is certainly late game oriented (Even better if the adventure is starting at epic tier), it is still useful early. The druid has several powers that damage and hinder multiple targets, including encounter powers that dominate the target as early as level 7 and some excellent non summoning dailies like wall of thorns. And the fire hawk at will power gives you temporary threatening reach against te victim, all but guaranteing a second attack when the target moves or attacks. The initial stats ensure you can take feats like light shield proficiency in paragon and second skin in early epic + other shield related feats to patch your weaker fortitude defense. I hope druid players and fans of character optimization in general enjoy this. I also have two variations of this build: A Druid - Artificer and Druid - Bard hybrids that I'll post later."

If so please just delete this. To start off, Im playing in a prewritten 5e campaign with some people I met over discord because of the whole pandemic thing. This campaign has 6 players, however Im not going to go into detail in case one of them sees this post. To start off, Im playing a race that Ive seen people call OP. It gets a lot of resistances and is really strong. When I asked the DM if I could play the race, he said that it was fine, since it was from an allowed source book, even after I double checked and told him it seemed really powerful. I made my class a hexblade, which is also pretty strong. I was originally planning to play another caster but we needed another frontliner and this meant I could still cast some cool spells. Pretty early into the game, I came across an overpowered weapon that an enemy dropped. This thing does some serious damage that basically gives me a rogue sneak attack whenever I hit with it. I made this my pact weapon as soon as possible because it was better than my lame axe. Even though I found out it was cursed (giving me vulnerability to necrotic) I still feel like Im stepping on everyones toes by using it, since the other magic items we have are far less powerful. And then in our most recent session I got an absolutely batshit insane ring. Taking the ring despite some obvious red flags earned me an alignment shift. I was given its stats as a whisper and its so strong. When I read it I was saying that it was super powerful and how awesome it was without disclosing what it did. And now I just feel really bad. Nobody else has any strong magic items and Im just going to kill literally everything with my new stuff. I was already hogging the spotlight out damaging everyone and now I feel like Im just min-maxing and hogging the spotlight. Is there anyway to stop stepping on everyones toes? We just got a bunch of money and stuff, so Im hoping my fellow adventurers can get some magic items from a shop or something when we reach the next big settlement. But if that doesnt happen, or if they dont buy some strong magic items? I honestly dont know what Ill do. Im already really bad for talking over other players, and interrupting people. I even tried to attack the bad guy during his evil monologue because I was worried the ghost/projection of him was going to attack us, and the other players mentioned later that you should always let them monologue. Especially when we have little info. How can I be a better player and team mate? Im so worried that Im ruining this game for everyone and nobodys having fun because of me and I really just want to make sure everyone enjoys the DMs hard work."

The initial ability scores can be 11 13 10 16 18 08 since the level 6 utility serpent's cunning gives + 1 on intelligence attacks for the entire day but you won't be able to take the second skin feat (+2 AC) in epic. This build takes advantage of the artificer's arcane empowerment class feature to reuse your best items daily powers. You will be using a bow for the artificer weapon attacks and a Ki Focus as an implement. At level 4 you get access to the screaming bow, which converts neutral damage to thunder while the lvl 9 thunderfist ki focus turns your melee damage into thunder. The artificer has plenty of weapon attacks that deal untyped damage and the Druid's summons mostly have melee attacks, so you will be dealing thunder damage on 90% of your attacks. This combos nicely with the genasi's racial power that gives you 1d8 per tier extra damage on a hit with lightning/thunder attacks and the Screaming bow's daily power gives 10/15/20 thunder vulnerability to one enemy + 5 vulnerability to those adjacent to it. If you take a second screaming bow (even if it has to be one level lower), you get four uses of it's daily power per day, as you can use arcane empowerment to refill each of them once. The artificer has several multi attack and off turn encounter powers while the druid has much better offensive dailies, forming a nice balance since heroic. The recomended paragon path is traveler's harlequin because it allows you to have multiple class specific multiclass feats and even gives you one for free. Using it for MC avenger gives you one use of oath of enmity per encounter (useful for your summons melee attacks), access to holy symbols and the pervasive light feat (If your team has a morninglord distributing radiant vulnerability left and right). The Symbol of victory daily power gives you an action point when you crit and you can reuse it once thanks to arcane empowerment. That's 4 to 5 APs per day (or 6 with solitaire violet starting at level 26, but that's overkill) or one AP per encounter. The cipher theme lets you use two of those per encounter once a day, which you can do by simply not using an AP for one encounter. After you already activeted the symbol of victory twice, you could wear a symbol of divine light to increase radiant vulnerabilty on enemies. The MC swordmage is there for power swapping a lvl 16 utility for borrowed confidence. an encounter itulity that let's you roll twice for all attacks until the start of your next turn. It greatly increases your accuracy on nova turns and helps in getting those crits for activating symbol of victory/solitaire violet even without expanded crit range. IF you have a bard/warlord/someone that gives you huge bonuses to hit, you can skip the MC swordmage and take other feats instead. Traveler's harlequin also let's you choose your lvl 20 daily from all paragon paths you have access to or take a lvl 19 daily from one of your classes. I recommend the lvl 20 summon power from the Primal Summoner paragon path (PP). Things get crazy at level 21 when each of your action points give you 3 extra actions and you can use minor actions to make them attack. Also, the primal resurgence feat giives you an extra use of a primal daily power. Assuming a 5 encounter day, you can use an artificer daily in one of them and one druid summon on each of the others. No action point for the encounter of the artificer daily, one on three others and two on a single encounter. AND you can create thunder vulnerability in 4 of those. Don't do it the encounter you summon the lightning drake, as you can't convert it's AOE damage to thunder (it still gets the extra damage from the genasi racial because it's lightning). There's also a massive combo you can make with the writhing henge level 25 daily. You can check that on the original build from the link: [URL Hope everyone who likes druids and character optimization enjoys this one."

I played around with it for an afternoon, and I think I found a suitable compromise over the current errata released by WoTC. This errata gives the spell agency against those creatures that are immune to poison, but not disease, gives the disease a slightly higher chance of sticking, and fixes the problem presented by *Lesser Restoration*, a 2nd level spell, being able to easily overpower a 5th level spell. However, it still allows for its use to combat the diseases caused by the spell. To compensate, some of the diseases have been slightly altered.

46,vulnerability,DnD,V&amp;V: Vulvas and Vulnerability: or how 5 thirty-something women played their first D&amp;D game.,9,fuz1gc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fuz1gc/vv_vulvas_and_vulnerability_or_how_5/,2020-04-05 04:50:03,"My wife and a lot of her friends have been rather bored during quarantine. They are not really nerds. My wife says ""did you win?"" every time I come home from a D&amp;D session. But boredom has hit record levels and I suggested to her best friends that they should play DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS!! Much to my shock, they all thought it was a good idea! I have DMed for years. But running a game with 5 women in their late 30s who have never played any rollplaying game ever in their life (half of them didn't even know you have a character and the other half didn't know you roll dice) was the most fun in all my time running games. Some highlights from the game: * They approached the gruff, potmarked old guard to the cemetery. A low DC10 persuasion or a few coins would have gotten them access. However the Bard was excited to see that she had some pan flutes in her inventory and she wanted to play a song. Me, briefly puzzled said ""Um ooook... to what goal?"" And she responds with ""Well he doesn't seem too happy with his life, and I would like to play a song to appeal to his emotional vulnerabilities."" * Shortly thereafter they called the game not D&amp;D but V&amp;V, which she informed me meant Vulvas and Vulnerability. * While in the cemetery they got attacked by some zombies. Veterans to the game would be excited; COMBAT!!! But I really appreciated how combat was not their first instinct. The sorceress, not really knowing the rules on magic, says ""Can I use my magic to allow this zombie to finally rest? Are there souls in this game?"" * I appreciated how well they worked together, how there was never any desire to showboat or steal the scene. * Finally, after dealing with zombies and investigating other things in the cemetery and dealing with open graves, they all became rather filthy. At the very end of the session I said that they needed to make a name for their adventuring group. That name: **The Dirty Giners.** I cannot wait for the next session!!"
47,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Could the spell Bestow Curse bestow the curse of lycanthropy?,1,g1osu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/g1osu5/5e_could_the_spell_bestow_curse_bestow_the_curse/,2020-04-15 19:36:44,"Hi all, quick question about Bestow Curse. Its description says this: &gt;At the DMs option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curses effect. Obviously it's up to my DM, it says that in the spell description, but what do you think of being able to curse someone with lycanthropy via Bestow Curse? Obviously it'd be temporary, but it could still be a potent weapon to buff your allies and maybe even ruin someone's reputation by framing them as a monster. I should give some context: I'm currently playing as a NE human divine soul sorcerer who got bitten by a werewolf in the first session and became one herself. While in human form she doesn't have any special traits from the curse other than the fact that when she gets knocked unconscious as a result of dropping to 0 hit points she has to make a Wisdom saving throw or transform into her hybrid form and regain a hit point (assuming she isn't killed outright, of course). This means that transforming is always a risk, which is especially problematic if there are people she wants to trust her around (she's a major political figure and she doesn't want the secret getting out). While in hybrid form, she has the following traits (all homebrew made by me and my DM to ""fix"" lycanthropy): **Relentless.** Once per turn, if she takes less than 10 damage that would bring her to 0 hit points, she instead drops to 1 hit point. **Natural Weapons.** Her claws do 2d8 slashing and her bite does 2d6 piercing. **Damage Immunity.** She is immune to attacks from nonmagical weapons that aren't silvered. **Damage Vulnerability.** She is vulnerable to attacks from weapons that are silvered. **Berserk.** Her alignment is Unaligned and she gains the following flaw: ""I can't let anyone see me like this. If they come too close I'll gouge out their eyes!"" **Lunatic.** She remains in hybrid form as long as she is in full moonlight. If she transformed due to being damaged, she remains transformed until she drops unconscious. **Speed.** Her speed increases by 5ft. **AC.** Her AC improves by 1, although any nonmagical clothing/armour that isn't designed to fit her hybrid form is ruined by the transformation. &amp;#x200B; So if she cast Bestow Curse on someone, would it make sense to be able to bestow this curse? If she cast it on an ally they'd be able to survive an attack that would otherwise knock them down, but that ally would also be Berserk and might end up with a very problematic flaw. Cast on an enemy, it could make for a great humiliation tactic if that enemy is a political one. Cast it on the enemy in a public place, have the party's druid cast [this homebrew spell which creates full moonlight](URL (I created it months before this campaign for a different campaign), run away and presto, the enemy is slandered as a werewolf. One thing I'm not sure of: if someone is temporarily cursed as a lycanthrope and then bites someone, is that curse permanent or not? So what do you think? Is it abusing the spell or does it make sense? &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR - Should Bestow Curse be able to bestow lycanthropy? I have homebrewed lycanthropy a little to make it less powerful and harder to control, but it still could be used as a buff. What do you think of the idea?** &amp;#x200B; EDIT: I'm not saying that Bestow Curse should be able to turn someone into a lycanthrope permanently! I'm still abiding by the rules for the spell's duration here."

Passed through blood, this affliction transforms its host into a being of the undead with great strength and a thirst for blood. Having become the very sort of thing they set out to destroy, these hunters use their otherworldly abilities to infinitely track down the wicked, knowing that they have the potential to live long enough to snuff out all that is evil in the realm.*** # Vampyrism Upon choosing this order at 3rd level, you learn to understand the curse bestowed upon you and how to control the blood lust now inside you. You gain the following properties:  Resistance to cold and necrotic damage  Vulnerability to fire and radiant damage  You gain proficiency in persuasion  You take 1d4 radiant damage for every 10 minutes spent in direct sunlight.

The creature must make a CON saving throw to end the poison when the brand is moved from them. On a failed save the poison lasts 1d4 rounds while the curse is flushed out of their system. &amp;#x200B; # Blood Curse of the Compelling At 15th level, your hemocraft pulls power from your vampyrism to allow you to inflict a new blood curse upon your enemies. **Blood Curse of the Compelling** When a creature you can see makes an attack against you or an ally, you can use your reaction to compel them to instead target another creature you can see. **Amplify**: You may compel the creature to move up to their speed before choosing the new target &amp;#x200B; # Vampyric Lord *(Not sure about the name of this one)* At 18th level, If you completely drain a creature of medium size or larger of blood you can use a bonus action to transform into a Vampyric Lord for 1 hour.

50,vulnerability,DnD,The Fifteen Curses,1,g5ucuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/g5ucuw/the_fifteen_curses/,2020-04-22 14:07:39,"This is for a game I am currently running. The following effects are for a late game area that they will visit multiple times. I would like feedback on these effects. Context: They curses only exist in a place often called the Sunken City. It is essentially a city that used to exist on the normal world but kind of sunk down into the under dark. It was sunk by one of its fifteen councilors(the ruling body) on the same day that the gods attacked and nearly eradicated an extremely powerful magical race. Think dragons and Dragonborn for the relationship between that race and the members of the Sunken City. When the city sank, that same councilor essentially froze everyone in the city the way they were directly before it sank. This includes the other councilors. However those councilors were able to resist the magic to an extent and now roam the city as kind of a shadow of themselves(essentially just an incarnation of their magic, their bodies are elsewhere). A decent part of the campaign will involve trapping these 14 incarnations are forcing them back into their bodies. This will reward them with a powerful magical item for each councilor with the rule that each player can only have one so they will have to pick and choose. If they disturb the bodies in any way after they forced the magic back into them then these curses will trigger depending on which one they mess with. Keep in mind these are very powerful beings and these curses essentially severely punish players for messing with weird magical bodies after the magic of those bodies nearly killed them. IMPORTANT: Effects listed with the bestowing of the curses ignore immunity, resistance, and weakness. Everyone is affected the same way by these events. Key: U=cannot be undone or revived even with a wish spell R=removes immunity/resistance to the listed effect of present Special Rules: The Amulet of Life- This item is obtained by putting the to rest the councilor described in #12.

Thanks so much for reading! Again I would love feedback."

53,vulnerability,DnD,Beginner's guide to superpower campaign design using only whats in the core books.,1,gbgatg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/gbgatg/beginners_guide_to_superpower_campaign_design/,2020-05-01 21:21:55,"I recently realised that it is really easy to have superpowers in your game beyond natural or normal abilities. We all know an archmage is on par with a lesser god and a level 20 fighter can take on a decent size army of normal soldiers and win, and that every adventurer is an exceptional individual of the sort that destiny tags to help save the world... But none of that is superpowers. those are class abilities and suchlike that the mechanics allow for and that are baked into the default assumptions of the game world. They don't go beyond what we normally think is possible in the game. Many of you will disagree, but roll with it for the time being and see if this is a system you'd like to include or already have included. So, how to add really abnormal superpowers to the game? Divine blessings, permanent high level spells, and top tier eldritch invocations. Let me explain these outrageous seeming blank statements: At character creation, have your players tell you what they want as a concept for their character as a superpowered individual (say, a Hercules, a Wolverine, and a Skitter), then you as the DM would go through the book and pick out a set of spells or invocations or blessings that fit the shape of the idea (e.g. strength is 22 to start, and cannot get less than 15 on any strength based check, saving throw, or attack. Can at will create a 1d6+STR mod slashing damage melee weapon on each hand at the cost of being able to use that hand for other purposes for as long as it is used for this, and the player regains a hit die of HP at the start of every round. Can conjure a medium sized swarm of insects at will, can use these as if casting arcane eye at will, can cast insect plague at will, deciding who will be harmed and having the swarm remain until dismissed, and can use the insects to communicate at range. Skitter is OP in any context lacking Endbringers.) and you would pick a flaw or weakness for their power (such as a compulsion to obey lawful authorities or be rendered as weak as a normal man, a vulnerability to mind affecting magic, and a serious difficulty with non-intimidation diplomatic interaction). In all other respects, the characters are normal for their class and race, but with their power they can tackle mush more potent threats immediately as their other skills slowly catch up to their superpower. But why, I hear you inquire in distress, would I ever unbalance the game like this?! Because it's not necessarily unbalancing. You are the DM, you decide the challenges they face, you can play to each party member's strengths and prey on their weaknesses. A group of superpowered individuals can fight stronger threats, and that means you can throw stronger foes at them as needed, a superpower might vanish for no apparent reason and the character could gain a level as compensation while they and their fellows hunt for a way to get their power back (at which point everyone else gains a level to bring the party back to their old dynamic), and if the players have superpowers, their nemesis can have superpowers too. Sure, divine blessings and such are meant to be used later in the game, but fiddling with the scaling just means you need to do a bit of extra notetaking and planning in session prep, and it's there as a mechanic to be used. My personal favourite concept for a hero or villain that I hope to run or watch a player run is a guy who goes by Longarm. His power is that he cannot get less than a fifteen on any check to use any tool, or on Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, or Sleight of Hand, and he cannot get less than ten on any attack with weapons or unarmed strikes, and cannot deal less than average damage. His power is skill, but not necessarily knowledge, so his weakness is that he is no more knowledgeable or wise or charming than any other person of his natural ability. To challenge such a character I would present them with social situations and puzzles, villains who plan for his success at skill based obstacles and count on him following them right to where they want him, and large numbers of enemies that force him to lean on his teammates. I would play to his strengths with missions that require specialised tools, commissions for items that showcase his crafts, and enemies who he can handle."

You are unable to remember any of your spells during these rounds. Otherwise, you may act as you please. 74. You suddenly receive a burst of paralysing energy, mimicking Power Word Stun. You must immediately choose a creature within 60 feet to direct the energy to. If you do not choose, you undergo the effects. The DC is your Spell Save: 75. An elemental magically appears 10 feet in front of you, or in the nearest unoccupied space. Roll a 1d4. 1 = Earth. 2 = Air. 3 = Fire. 4 = Water. The elemental will remain for 1d6 rounds, and will attack the nearest enemy, and be under the DMs control. If no enemies are nearby, it will remain by your side as a silent guardian. 76. A small orb of radiant light shoots out to 30 feet in front of you, and explodes. All creatures within 30 feet of the orb must succeed on a DC15 Constitution Save. If it fails, it is blinded for 1 minute. Affected targets can roll a DC15 Con Save at the end of their turns. On a success, the effect ends. 77. You turn into a Red Dragon for 1d4 rounds. Roll a D20. 1 to 12, you are a Red Wyrmling Dragon. 13 to 19, you are a Young Red Dragon. 20, you are an Adult Red Dragon.

Your arms switch places with your legs. Roll a DC 18 Acrobatics Check. In the event of a failure, you fall prone. Success, nothing happens. Every time you want to move, you must make another Acrobatics Check, failing prone in the event of a fail. This lasts for 1d4 rounds. 79. You get tongue tied for 1d4 rounds.

They may keep their handheld weapons/spellcasting focus, but any items, clothing and armour they are carrying are teleported to a pocket dimension beyond their reach. 82. You can mimic voices you have heard perfectly. If you mimic the same voice for 1 hour you start to take on the original speaker's appearance. Both effects end after 24 hours 83. You cast Fireball at level 5, centred on yourself. 84. You gain the gravitational force field of a much larger object than yourself. Every round, for 1d4 rounds, at the start of your next turn, every creature within 100 feet who are large or smaller, are pulled 10 feet towards you at the start of your turn. Creatures cannot move further away from you. Creatures can make a Strength Save DC 20 to avoid both effects. 85. A reaper materialises from the negative plane 60 feet away from you, with the intention of reaping your soul. It will not attack other players unless forced to do so. It will remain for the next minute. If the reaper dies, it will drop a Reapers Scythe. 86. You gain the ability to manipulate air for the next 1d4 rounds. As a bonus action on your turn, you may attempt to move any creature within 60 feet of you, up to 20 feet in any direction. If the target is unwilling, they must make a DC20 Strength save. 87. The caster exhales petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature (including the caster) in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. 88. The caster is suddenly trapped in a giant anti-magic glass ball that looks like a snowglobe. This glass will shatter once it receives 30 points of damage. Magic cannot touch, enter or be used within this globe. 89. The caster and their nearest enemy exchange minds for 1d6 rounds. The targets will then have a physical HP (the HP in their current body), and a mind HP (their original HP). All damage done to their physical bodies will also be done as psychic damage to their original mind/HP. The two can still cast spells, if they can meet the requirements of said spells. Targets cannot use the features of their new bodies, but can make one weapon attack using their new bodys stats. Both targets would need to faint for this to be reversed before the 1d6 rounds are over. If the targets faint, they enter death save mode. 90. A spectral stopwatch appears in front of the caster, freezing time for 1d4 rounds for everyone in the material plane, apart from the caster, during which you can use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it. 91. You teleport to another realm for 1d4 rounds. Roll 1d4. 1 = The Astral Plane. 2 = The Nine Hells. 3 = The Shadowfell. 4 = The Feywild 92. You glow brightly for 1 minute. All melee attacks done against you are made with disadvantage. Ranged attacks against you further than 10 feet are made with advantage. 93. You can hear the thoughts of all creatures within 60ft for 1 minute. DC 15 Wisdom save to not be overwhelmed. If you fail you are incapacitated. You can retry the save at the end of each of your turns. If you succeed you can make a DC 15 insight check to hone in on one creature's thoughts. 94. 1d10 small planets orbit you for 1 minute. The planets inhabitants will try to land ships on you to investigate dealing 1d6 fire damage per planet. They can only do this once, and will do so at the end of the casters next turn. 95. All creatures within 300 feet of you, including yourself, heal 10d10, as a wave of healing pulsates outwards from you. 96. You turn into an elemental for 1d6 rounds. Roll a 1d4. 1 = Earth. 2 = Air. 3 = Fire. 4 = Water. If you die while in this form, you will revert back to your original form, with your original HP. 97. A magical vacuum encases you, draining you of your magic and life essence. You suffer from 1d4 exhaustion, and will follow the rules for exhaustion. 98. For your next turn, you take no action, movement or reaction. You vomit 1d100 Gold Coins. 99. 1d100 Spectral cat missiles streak out of the air towards a chosen target. Each will do 1 Force Damage. The target can make a DC 15 Dexterity check to see if they can avoid half of the cats. 100. The next phrase spoken by the caster becomes true. (DMs discretion. Be careful)"
55,vulnerability,DnD,Custom Class In Need Of Critique - 5th Edition,1,ffx5sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ffx5sh/custom_class_in_need_of_critique_5th_edition/,2020-03-10 03:19:21," Happy Monday DNDReddit! I'm a prospective game designer and writer working on a custom campaign setting. Below is a custom class for a campaign guide I'm writing. It's going to be the first of two classes included in the guide and I could use some player critique from the community to help balance and flesh it out more if needed. If you could either comment below or DM me with ideas and critiques, that would be fantastic! Also, if this is not quite the right subreddit, leave a link that points me in the right direction. Thanks! **The Wiccan** **Control The Prime Magics Or Be Consumed By Them** Wiccan have chosen to find the sources of the ancient, primal magics of the world by any means necessary, often though great personal sacrifice. To understand the deep knowledge of the first magics and how they came to be is considered the greatest of endeavors. Some have come to prominence with their mastery, and some have fallen deep into madness in their pursuit. Because of the controversial nature of their journey into the unknown, most Wiccan who have attempted the search have never returned. Only a few with the strongest of bodies and minds survived to spread their knowledge to those few who deem it a worthy endeavor. Most live as nomads on the fringes of society, playing at healers and protectors of those they deem worthy. Some slipped into darkness and use blood and soul magics to enslave, corrupt, and hold dominion over those lesser than themselves. **With Ancient Magic Comes Ancient Power** The true nature of how a Wiccans abilities came to them and where they learned their magics is relatively unknown to those who practice the Arcane and Divine arts. The subject of Wiccan Power is controversial at best, and many of the students under an Arcane or Divine servitude are forbidden to study it. Because of this, Wiccan are kept at a distance from society, and generally reviled as blasphemers and apostates to the true magical arts. To be a Wiccan is to accept this life, and do with the power that was sought what you will to shape the world. **Creating a Wiccan** As you create your Wiccan, keep in mind how your character has sought this power and what trials and tribulations occurred in your search. Also, how does your character view civilized society, the other magical arts, and divinity? Do they wish to use their powers for the good of the people, seeing the ancient magics as a boon to those who need it? Or do they see it as power incarnate, and wish to use it to assert dominance on the lesser beings? Do you enjoy the company of others or stay within your solitude, certain that the primal power you sought after need be your only friend? While a Wiccan begins their journey to find the primal powers on their own, they also acknowledge the benefits of companionship and trust between folk. The Wiccans known to society, while controversial and nomadic, are often seen as alternative choices for a multitude of purposes. Healing the sick, defending townships ill equipped to hire mercenaries or seek help from the nobility make Wiccans a useful service. Quick Build You can make a Wiccan quickly by following these suggestions. First, make **Wisdom** or **Strength** your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on the Primeval Magic path or the Primeval Warrior path. Make Wisdom your highest score if you follow the Primeval Magic path, which allows a Wiccan access to the Wiccan magic table and spells much like a Wizard or Sorcerer. Choose either Constitution or Dexterity as your second highest ability score if you choose this path. Make your highest score Strength if you choose the Primeval Warrior path, which grants access to bonuses and abilities in melee or ranged combat. Choose **Dexterity** or **Constitution** as your second highest ability score. **Class Features:** As a Wiccan, you gain the following features. **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Wiccan level **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8+ plus your Constitution modifier **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Wiccan level after 1st. **Proficiencies** **Armor:** Light Armor **Weapons:** Simple Weapons **Tools:** Alchemists Supplies **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Constitution **Skills:** Choose three / History, Deception, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion, Survival **Equipment:** You start with the following equipment. In addition to the equipment granted by your background: * A component pouch * An explorers pack * 1 Regular Healing Potion **Bound Weapon:** In your search for the ancient powers that once were, you stumbled upon the knowledge that initiated your journey as a Wiccan. This ancient knowledge allowed you to summon a simple weapon of your choice at will that is bound to you. Beginning at 1st level, You may use a bonus action to summon your bound weapon. You have proficiency and are considered trained with this weapon and may summon it as many times per day as your Wisdom modifier. Any attack or effect that would knock you unconscious dispels the weapon and you must summon it again. Upon reaching 6th level, you may use a free action to summon the weapon. **Primeval Call:** At 2nd level, you have learned to call upon the ancient powers that you have discovered to aid you. As a bonus action, you may invoke the Primeval Call to summon a creature from the netherworld of the ancients to aid you in battle. This creature must be of a challenge rating, (CR), of 1/4 or lower. The creature aids you for rounds equal to half your Wisdom modifier. You must be able to verbally command the creature each round or the creature vanishes. Once used, this power resets after a long rest. At 6th level, the challenge rating raises to 1/2, at 9th level it raises to 1, at 13th level it raises to 2. After 6th level, the creature lasts until you choose to dispel it. **Primeval Path:** At 3rd level, your Wiccan must commit to a Primeval Path. Choose Primeval Warrior or Primeval Magi, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. **Primeval Warrior** The Primeval warrior is the most martial of the Wiccan, pursuing mastery of all weapons as well as the mind and body. The Primeval Warrior strives for physical and mental perfection as well as training to resist many of the maladies that strike the normal populace. Those that are known have been commissioned to defend towns and villages from monsters, and aid in the wars of the outside world. **Weapon Mastery:** When you join this order at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Martial weapon type and you may change your Bound Weapon to mirror this type. **Warriors Way:** At 7th level, your physical body has been trained to be more resilient and resistant to wear and tear. As a bonus action, you use your training and advanced techniques to reduce damage from weapons that deal Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Slashing damage by half. You may do this for rounds equal to half your Strength or Dexterity modifier. **Battle Superiority:** Beginning at 10th level, your mastery of battle has made you a force to be reckoned with for opponents. You may choose 2 combat maneuvers from the Battle Master subclass in fighter and add them to your abilities, (attributes for each maneuver stay the same). You may use these maneuvers a number of times equal to half your strength modifier. **Eyes of a Killer:** At 15th level, you have mastered the art of viewing the weak points of your enemies and exploiting them. For as many rounds equal to 1/4 of your Strength modifier, you may turn a regular hit into a critical hit. **Of The Ancient Death:** Upon reaching 18th level, you channel the secrets of the ancient powers to such a degree that you can inflict the maximum punishment on an enemy. Before attacking, you can declare your next strike to be Of The Ancient Death. On a hit, the target makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your level. If failed, the target is reduced to 0 hit points. If saved, the target takes damage equal to half his/her hit points rounded down. You may do this once per day. **Primeval Mage** The Primeval Mage has learned the secrets of the Primeval Magics and the ways in which to employ them. Long ago the secrets of the Primeval Magics were contained into volumes and secreted away to places long thought forgotten, until the Wiccan found it. Using this newfound magical prowess, the Primeval Magi was able to utilize spells different from the Arcane and Divine to work wonders or exact terrible curses upon their foes. **Primeval Magi Spellcasting:** As a Wiccan Primeval Magi, you have gained access to spellcasting and have augmented your combat techniques with the ability to cast Druid spells. See Chapter 10 (phb) for the general rules of spell casting and the Druid spell graph for slots and other information. **Spell Slots:** The Primeval Magi spell casting table shows how many spell slots you have. You have access to Druid spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 8th level, you have four 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell \_, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell. **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Wiccan spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. ***Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier*** ***Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier*** **Wiccan Channeling:** At 3rd level, you now have the ability to channel an effect of the ancient powers of old. As an action, you can choose to channel your body or the body of a character with an effect of your choice. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may channel a number of times equal to half your level rounded down. **Channel Fortitude:** You or another player gain advantage on Strength and Constitution checks **Channel Mind:** You or another player gain advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks **Channel Reflexes:** You or another player gain advantage on Dexterity checks **Channel Vitality:** You or another player regain 5 hit points **Channel Focus:** You or another player gain advantage on their next attack **Wiccan Frenzy:** Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you may make one weapon attack with your Bound Weapon as a bonus action. **Splice Magic:** At 10th level, you combine two magical effects of your choice in a single attack, dealing double the amount of energy and effects to a devastating degree. Doing so requires a massive amount of concentration and energy on the part of the Primeval Magi and leads to an adverse effect after the splice is completed. As an action, you may combine two spells of an equal level and type into one, spending two spell slots in the process. On a hit, a target takes both damage and any peripheral effects of the spliced spells at once. The following after effects apply when Splice Magic is used. ***1st level:*** *You take 10 points of psychic damage* ***2nd level:*** *You take 10 points of psychic damage and your maximum hit points are reduced by 5* ***3rd level:*** *You take 15 points of psychic damage and fall prone* ***4th level:*** *You take 15 points of psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned.

56,vulnerability,DnD,[OC] Need help creating a curse based on the Twelve Labors of Hercules,1,fh0va6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fh0va6/oc_need_help_creating_a_curse_based_on_the_twelve/,2020-03-12 04:29:32,"So I was inspired to create a shapeshifting curse, meant for a 5e campaign based heavily on Greek myths and heroes, with each of the labors having their own form/effect. But then I ran into the problem of not actually having ideas for some of them. My ideology was that each labor had a really strong effect, but came at a pretty big price. Anyways here's what I have. Any ideas are welcome, especially on ideas for each labor, or comments on how to balance each form better. Thanks! ~ An ancient curse once placed on a legendary hero from a culture long dead. The curse itself has twelve forms, on for each of the labors the hero went through. When not in use, the curse looks like a set of black tribal tattoos curled around the shoulder and bicep. It takes an action to 'undergo' a labor, and everytime you undergo a labor, you reduce your HP max by 1d4, plus the modifier associated with the labour. The labor lasts until your next short rest, or if you spend a bonus action to stop it.  1st Labor: +6 Gain Resistance to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage, and if you already have resistance, you gain full immunity. A large tattoo resembling a lions head and it's mane forms on your back and arms.  2nd Labor: +6 At the beginning of every turn that you start with less than full HP, you gain HP equal to 1d6 + your constitution modifier. You also gain a vulnerability to fire, and any HP lost to fire damage cannot be healed by this labor. Around your neck and shoulders forms a spiral tattoo of several serpentine heads.  3rd Labor: +6 Gain the effects of a permanent 'Haste' spell on you, and proficiency in Wisdom (Survival) ability checks. Your legs are covered in markings as your eyes glow yellow and dilate.  4th Labor: +4 You now count as one size larger. You can use a bonus action to take the Dash action, and gain advantage on all Constitution saving throws. You gain a vulnerability to frost damage. Your chest is covered in markings resembling fur, and horns.  5th Labor: +3 As an action, you can create a jet of water from the palm of your hands, and any creature blasted by this water must make a DC 16 strength saving throw, or be knocked prone and immediately moved 10ft in a direction.  6th Labor: +6 Gain proficiency in Longbows, Shortbows, and Crossbows. Now, whenever using a bow, you can use your strength instead of dexterity for the attack and damage rolls, and as a bonus action, you can make another attack with the bow, and ignore the 'loading' property. While undergoing this labor, you lose your sense of hearing, and gain disadvantage on perception checks. Your hands, back, and ears are covered by feathery tattoo markings.  7th Labor: +4 You gain advantage on attacks made after moving 15ft in a straight line, but any attacks made on you while moving those 15ft have advantage as well. You also gain proficiency in Wisdom (animal handling) checks.  8th Labor: +5 As a bonus action, you can make a fire breath attack, dealing 2d6 fire damage in a 10ft cone, and can spend your action to eat a piece of that creature, dealing 2d8 piercing damage, and once you do, you gain advantage on all attacks against that creature. Once you do bite into a creature, make a DC 13 wisdom saving throw or go into a blood craze, and attack the creature closest to you on your next turn. At the end of your turn, you can make the saving throw again.  9th Labor: +3 You gain proficiency in Survival, and have advantage in Intimidation checks against creatures of the opposite gender. Creatures with no gender are not affected.  10th Labor: +6 2 sets of spectral arms sprout from your back, allowing you to equip extra weapons to each arm. You also gain the ability to use a bonus action to make an extra attack with one of your spectral arms. However, you also gain 2 extra sets of legs, halving your movement speed.  11th Labor: +4 Your carrying, pushing, and lifting capacity are tripled, and gain proficiency in deception checks.  12th Labor +9: Whenever you are reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, you can make a DC 10 constitution saving throw to not drop. The DC increases by 5 for every subsequent attack after the first. And whenever an effect would kill you outright without damaging you, you may make the same saving throw."
57,vulnerability,DnD,Original content idea: Moonlit Occultist/werewolf variants,1,fiodja,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/fiodja/original_content_idea_moonlit_occultistwerewolf/,2020-03-15 06:53:22,"I like a lot of the touch of class stuff, and would love to play a werewolf character, but I noticed a lot of the features seemed lacking, and seemed geared towards more evil leaning traits, I mean I get that is kinda the occultist spin, but if a character is fighting his inner beast why are the higher level abilities basically encouraging straying from that, eating human flesh or blood if you want the resistances. Also, the werewolf path seems to get the short end of the stick, a new form, cool, but no actual changes to game stats, needed to use dark strike, and cant become human during the full moon? It doesnt seem to confer any actual advantage outside of cosmetic. And the corrupting fangs feature may take a person out of a fight, but also may make a surviving enemy stronger To that end I was thinking of variants and additions to give this class to improve on that. First, I had the idea of a occultist trying to turn to the light, maybe with religious or magic oaths that draw on the power of the moon as the light in the darkness to make a Moonlit Occultist. For the most part the class features would remain the same with a couple of variations. The Dark Strike would deal radiant damage instead of necrotic, while a new feature, dark appetite would be added, which would essentially be a check during certain periods or triggers to resist dark impulses like drinking blood or hunting for human flesh. Then when the otherworldly shadow kicks in, replace with Oath of light to gain resistances and an additional removal of silver vulnerability, one must not eat the triggers that would usually provide those benefits, and violating that would remove the benefits. Its a small change but would make it feel more towards a monster looking for redemption. Meanwhile, I feel the werewolf doesnt gain much from his 1st level, so I would add: lycanthropic healing - it gives a pool of level x 4 healing points to the player. It works like lay on hands but only applies to the werewolf and not others, signifying a werewolfs regenerative abilities. It can be used as a bonus actions, recharges after a long rest, but is suppressed if the werewolf takes damage before his turn that round. As for corrupting bite, I would add alternative option adding a third attack when using the attack option(occultists at this point can make 2) as well as making their natural attacks considered magical when overcoming resistances. Anyway, there more like tweets, but I would like to see if this seems like good idea for the class options."

61,vulnerability,DnD,My (Now Redundant) Experience With The Blood Hunter,2,ezeqlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ezeqlt/my_now_redundant_experience_with_the_blood_hunter/,2020-02-06 06:19:28,"Here I am, coming up on the end of a campaign arc, jotting down my thoughts on the Blood Hunter having played the Mutagen Order up to lvl 8 (technically 9, but seems like we're gonna end juuuust before I get to actually use it) and then. And then Matt releases a revamp of the entire class. .... Whelp. I put some brain effort into this, and we're gonna have the old one on DnD Beyond for a few more weeks still, so I'm still gonna post this. I'll just include a bonus ""how looks to me"" bit at the end. So to start off with: Context Because this might explain why I have the thoughts I do. I played a longbow wielding Order of the Mutagen Blood Hunter, getting to play with all of the abilities up-to and including lvl 8. My stat priorities went DEX/CON/INT/WIS/CHA/STR, as when I stepped back and took a look at it, I didn't need to prioritize Wisdom for the Mutagen and I wanted a high INT for thematic and character reasons (though my INT and WIS ended up being the same by 4th level, so it's neither here nor there). So this means: I didn't really care for WIS, and I'm a Ranged DEX build. I spent a lot of time in the backline and in most of the campaign I wasn't attacked. Between having a Wizard and a Cavalier I was never really a priority or accessible target, which is exactly what you want from your Archery-Fighter. The other key thing to note: I have Wil Wheaton Disease. My rolls are garbage, I've gone combats without hitting a single thing. So, while I can succeed on things sometimes, my penchant for failure lingers in the back of my mind. I also didn't learn this until after the game started. SO, with that lens, let's go. (If you don't want to read the details, skim for the TLDRs, I included a few) --- Overall: My overall opinion: It's pretty cool. The flavour of the class is 10/10. The ""take on the evil to fight the evil"" is rad, and it was perfect for the character I wanted to play in the campaign I played in. I've had a good time playing my Blood Hunter, but I think I enjoy the flavour of the class and subclass more than some of the actual features. BUT I would still encourage people to play it, because this also might be Just A Me Thing, and there's enough Fighter in this to make it all still solid to play. So, my Review. I guess I'll go through on a feature-by-feature basis, starting with the overall class and then go into the Mutagen. --- BH Base Class: Hunter's Bane We made some modifications to this, so I didn't exactly use this right. But I think both as it's Actual Function and the way I used it were fun and felt good! It matched the themes, and I found it was a class tool I used probably the most frequently. Crimson Rite I had a good time with this ability all around, and coming up with the narrative reason as to why my character can channel an element is interesting and allowed me to make my character feel unique. I also think that the sacrifice of Max HP is cool and thematic. As a ranged character, I never had a big issue with losing my Max HP, and the fact that you use a d10 for Hit Points (and I also apparently had a series of really good rolls) meant that HP was never an issue for me. Fun flavour, extra damage (that scales) and idk I just like this a ton. Fighting Style Cool, helpful. I like the hard cementing into this as a Fighter class, it compliments the features well and makes them feel impactful. Having a +2 to hit on ranged attacks helped my poor rolling immensely. Blood Maladict Cool idea, not sure about the execution? The flavour of this is rad, basically manipulating the blood of your enemies for yourself to do some fancy stuff. But this is my biggest ""ehhhhhn"" feature on the functionality side. The Curses you pick from are cool in theory, but they're so drilled into specific scenarios that I don't see any temptation in most of them. Especially at higher levels. So I'm gonna pull the actual text that's the part that that didn't quite feel right right from the DnD Beyond version of the class (as of Jan 2020): ""You learn one additional blood curse of your choice, and you can choose one of the blood curses you know and replace it with another blood curse, at 5th, 9th, 13th, 16th, and 20th level."" It doesn't seem like much, but when you take into account how situational many of the Curses are, it becomes hard to choose which ones to take. While I know the general theme of the campaign, I can never be too sure if I'm actually going to come up against spell casters, or if Conditions are going to be an actual issue. I kept worrying about the following scenarios: 1) I feel like I have a useless class feature because I incorrectly predicted the way our campaign was gonna go and I never get to use them. 2) I level up just before a section with a lot of Wizards. I take the anti-magic Curses. They're very useful for those 5-ish session. We then hardly see any other spellcasters, mostly monsters with spell effects or just Big Smashy Dudes, and I'm stuck with this ability for 4 levels. Which, once you hid mid-tier levels, can be a long IRL time. It's one thing to have a class feature that you get and never use. The feature is the feature, WOTC did this to you, what're you gonna do? It's got a different vibe when you're the one who picked the function of the feature, but you didn't pick one that you could use and you just feel dumb for a few levels. And that's all amplified when you're at a higher level, and it takes so so long to get to a level that you can change it. Is this just a me thing? Maybe. Some people might be better at understanding how to pick and use the Curses than me. I just don't really enjoy having to make a long term choice that I can't modify or learn from, and I play feeling guilty for a few months because I made a mistake. I'm also not a fan of the phrasing of the Marked curse. I wish it was ""the next time you hit"" instead of ""in the next turn when you hit."" As someone with Will Wheaton Disease I was always too afraid to miss and waste the feature to even bother using it. But, to end on a higher note, the Amplify? Super cool, 10/10 I love the way the class (and mutagen subclass) in general is all about sacrificing something for power. It feels like an interesting, active choice and just *chef's kisses* Ability Score Improvement Cool cool. I like that, again, it leans Fighter and you get a few more than normal. Extra Attack Yep. Same as above, Fighter cool, more Crimson Rite usage. So, that's all of my experiences with the base class. I love the flavour, love the sacrifice-to-gain-power bit, love Crimson Rite. Iffy on Blood Maladicts, too situational for me to make confident choices. --- Onto the Mutagen! Your TLDR for the subclass function: you make little potions you drink, which give you a benefit in exchange for a sacrifice. Gain DEX score, lose WIS score. Get a damage resistance, gain a damage vulnerability. Super nifty. Overall Flavour Excellent. This was exactly what I was looking for for my character, it lends itself to the academic/alchemist flavour I wanted. It felt a little off overall though, with how the reccomendation for the BH is to go WIS based, but to be honest you don't reeeeeaally need to focus WIS. You use it for your Survival check for the Hunter's Bane and one Blood Curse option, but otherwise it's not used for the main class and this subclass. So, yeah! I like how it takes what feel is like an INT-based concept and doesn't include a reliance on a non-INT stat, which lets me decide where I want to take my character. Mutagen Craft / Advanced Mutagen Craft (I'm just gonna talk about the 3rd and 7th lvl abilities in one go, because lvl 3 is ""do the thing"" and lvl 7 is ""do the thing, but twice."") IIIIII basically described it above. You get to make a potion that gives you a boon and a bane. Then you can make and drink two at the same time, and eventually 3. There's some cool stuff about it. If someone else drinks one of your mutagens, they get the bane without the boon (which I've been itching to use, but haven't had a chance). They take a short rest to make, and need to be remade every short rest as well, which is chill. Base concept feels good. Now, there is a similar issue with the mutagens as there is the Blood Maladict: ""You gain an additional formula at 7th level, 11th level, 15th level, and 18th level. Additionally, when you gain a new mutagen formula, you can choose one of the formulas you already know and replace it with another mutagen formula."" You only get to swap out a formula every 4 levels. While the mutagen formulas are much broader in scope and use than the Curses, you still might end up in a position where a formula ends up being less useful than you expected and now you're stuck with it. Less of an issue when you're lower level, but once you're up there you might end up with something useless for a large chunk of the campaign at higher levels. As for the formulas themselves, like I said they're more broad than the Curses. Overall they're varied enough to support a bunch of different builds, though there are still some that I feel like most people wouldn't take? Like, there's this triad of ""resist Physical Damage X, vulnerable to Physical Damage Y"" formulas, and I don't quite know who would want that for 4 levels when the physical damage types are so varied in combat? Maybe the Resist Slashing would be useful since most beasty type enemies have claws, but idk. As a Ranged character I always skipped over those anyway. The rest are pretty nifty, it's easy enough to find something to your liking, and while the overall lack of flexibility is present it mostly never felt like anything I chose was useless. --- So yeah. That's my experience as a just-hit-9th-level Mutagen Blood Hunter. On the one hand, having choice as a player can be great. But I find that the Blood Hunter is giving you choice without flexibility. I have the chance to do a bunch of cool things, but only if the right situations come up to use them. --- TLDR: While the flavour and some abilities of this class are fun to use and fit well with the character I wanted to make, some of the core features give you situational decisions to make without the flexibility to fix any mistakes or lessons learned quick enough to make them feel impactful. Also I should stick to ""make a saving throw"" casters. ----------- Wrap Up: Soooo, yeah! These are my thoughts on the version 1 of the Mutagen Blood Hunter. I'm sure there's plenty of mistakes I made in-game that hindered my experience with the Blood Hunter. Maybe I didn't/don't use my Blood Maladict optimally? Maybe there's things I'm just not doing right to best use the features? But regardless, none of it took away from my experience so much that I wouldn't recommend trying it. The flavour and subclasses alone are well worth the try, and it hasn't made me dislike my character at all. I will say it's been interesting looking at v1 vs v2, as if I had actually build my character around v2 things would have shaken out pretty differently. If you want to see it this experience play out in real-ish time, I actually play this character on a podcast called The Isle of Misfit Rolls! We do some additional tailoring to some things to make it fit the setting, like turning the ""tracking"" part of the initial Hunter's Bane into more of a sensing thing, and adding a new classification of Thing That Can Be Tracked. But things are meant to be changed to suit your campaign needs, so here we are xD ------------ Bonus: Blood Hunter 2.0 It should be noted that I have not had a chance to actually play any of these changes, and we've played far enough in our podcast campaign that we're letting our episodes catch up towards the end of the arc. So I won't be going back to try this new 2.0 update for a few months. These observations are based purely on my experience with version 1. I won't be going into major detail on the new skills, as it's still up for charity purchase, but I'll hopefully give enough information to voice my thoughts on them. --- I'm interested to try out the new Mutagen Blood Hunter. As you should be able to tell based on my above reviee, I'm stoked about the flavour change to DEX/INT over STR/WIS, though RIP my Strength save now xD Fighting Styles are all still there, that's nice. A little sad to see the loss of Max HP go away on the Crimson Rite (instead you just lose health) but the reasoning is fair I supooooose. My issue of ""choice without flexibility"" is still there in the Blood Maladict, and the levels you get to change them at have changed (you can't make your first change until SIXTH level now, not sure if I like that). My opinion on this remains the same. The actual Curses are largely different (RIP Mutual Suffering), and looking through them I'm not sure if any of them jump out at me as being things I really want. It's more like, ""Oh, I guess I'll take this and that."" Hopefully they'll feel better to use, they do overall seem more applicable to broader situations. There's also new Subclass Specific curses you can take, but only as of 15th level. HOWEVER they are a freebie, so it doesn't count against your known, and that's very nice. In general they all seem like they'll be a lot of fun, and the one for Mutagen looks really really cool. I hope we make it to 15 so I can use it! There's a new Branding ability that lets you mark a specific target for tracking and extra damage. It's mostly cool in concept BUT the combat aspect of the ability ONLY really benefits melee characters (as it involves you or someone withing 5ft if you), without any other benefit to a ranged character. That's super odd, and as a longbow user I don't like this. This ability's effects to upgrade at later levels, both as part of base BH and per your subclass, and those upgrades are rad as fuck, but the original base leaves my ranged character wanting from lvl 6 until lvl 11/13. Mutagen Side: I am very excited to try the new Mutagen stuff. I feel like this has done nothing but add some quality of life changes into it, and I'm a big fan. Mutagen Banes no longer effect someone else who tried to use it, so that's a little disappointing. But there's been a shuffling of subclass features on this side that are super interesting now. Some of the high level abilities were compressed into one and given at a lower level, and there's the new Brand and Curses bonuses given at the higher levels instead. These are good, cool, and seem exciting! (And the new 18th lvl ability is so very exciting to me. It makes me actually excited to devote to being a non-multiclass because it's something I want to use now) As for the mutagen formulas, I'm not sure how I feel about all of the ""resist X, vulnerable Y"" formulas still being there, along with some new types of them. While they seem like they fit the concept, there's still my same issue of ""choice without flexibility,"" and resisting cold damage might not be useful when you're stuck with it for ages. But! The mutagens I use, as well as some others, got some nice quality of life upgrades that really make more sense together. Example: Mobility used to give you grapple/restrain immunity in exchange for an initiative ding. Now instead of initiative, you get disadvantage on Strength ability checks, which feels more right. I guess that's the best way to summarize the Mutagen 2.0? On paper, everything like it's just going to feel more right. --- TLDR: Base Class changes are ehn. Some of the upgrades are nice, but one feature has an entire combat function that is largely useless for a ranged character. Subclass changes to Mutagen are excellent, I'm very excited to give them a shot! ----- (Oh boy, if you made it to the end of this, sorry that it ended up so long)"
62,vulnerability,DnD,[OC][Homebrew] New Attack Cantrips!

A few cantrips I dreamed up mostly to give themed casters more options, loosely modeled after existing spells and cantrips. Looking for feedback, and also just to hopefully give fun new attacks for would-be-spellslingers. **Spark Jolt** Evocation Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer, maybe Druid or Tempest Cleric Cantrip Casting Time 1 action Range 60 Feet Components V, S Duration Instantaneous You use your action to launch a stroke of electricity at a creature you can see. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing metal armor. On hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and its AC is reduced by 1 (2 after level 11) until the start of your next turn. The spell's damage die increases by one at levels 5, 11, and 17. Designer notes: The AC penalty is a result of me wanting it to have a secondary debuff effect, since I modeled it loosely after Ray of Frost. The reduction represents the opponent being ""tazed"" and a little less nimble temporarily. I believe the spell would still be completely acceptable without that aspect, so remove it if you wish. This was mostly created to be a go-to-cantrip for Storm Sorcerers, Blue Dragon Sorcerers, and any other Wizards or mages who desire a lightning theme. **Acid Dart** Evocation Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer, Druid Cantrip Casting Time 1 action Range 90 Feet Components V, S Duration Instantaneous You use your action to fire a dart of emerald green acid at a creature or object you can see. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 acid damage immediately and and 1d4 additional acid damage at the end of its next turn. A target that has (or gains) resistance to acid damage does not take the additional damage. The spell's damage die increases by 2d4 and the additional damage by 1d4 at levels 5, 11, and 17. Designer notes: If 2d4 initial damage is too strong, could make it 1d6 instead, but my thought process was that since Acid is a commonly resisted type balancing it a bit on the strong end could be okay. Same idea as Spark Jolt, I wanted this spell as a go to attack for Black Dragon Sorcerers and other Acid themed mages. **Force Missile** Evocation Wizard, Sorcerer Cantrip Casting Time 1 action Range 100 Feet Components V, S Duration Instantaneous You create a magic dart. It unerringly hits a creature you can see, dealing 1d4 force damage. The spell's damage die increases by one at levels 5, 11, and 17. Designer notes: My original thought was to make it 1d6 damage, but since Vicious mockery deals d4 damage + a debuff and still requires a saving throw, I think d4 guaranteed damage with no secondary effect would be acceptable. Feel free to rule it as a d6 if you think it's fair. **Toxic Bolt** Evocation Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer, possibly Druid cantrip Casting time: 1 action Range: 120 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous You hurl a bolt of toxic energy from your fingertips. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. The spell's damage die increases by one at levels 5, 11, and 17. Designer notes: Fourth verse, same as the first, a reliable ranged attack for poison themed casters. Damage die is low because the poison status is powerful, though I do pity anyone theming themselves after the most resisted damage type. \^\^; **Phantasmal Blast** Illusion Wizard, Sorcerer, Possibly Bard or Trickery Cleric Cantrip Casting Time 1 action Range 120 Feet Components V, S Duration Instantaneous You create an illusory ranged attack and launch it at a foe. Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target must then make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 1d12 psychic damage on a failure. The victim perceives the damage as a type matching the illusion you created (Fire if you threw a bolt of flame, piercing if you launched a stone spike, etc). The target has advantage on the saving throw if you chose an attack with a damage type that they would have resisted, and disadvantage if they would have vulnerability to that type.The spell's damage die increases by one at levels 5, 11, and 17. Designer notes: Given the attack roll AND the save required, I don't think this one will be reliable, but the damage is tuned high to compensate. I think it could be a fun spell for all manner of tricksters."

I've been in a campaign for 2 years, and I've finally hit level 6 with my Lore Bard (We play maybe once or twice a month, so level 6 is appropriate even though the campaign has been going on awhile). I'm playing a Triton Lore Bard in a homebrew setting based on Earth, and my DM is making my magical secrets Atlantean themed (Same as real life lore about Atlantis, a lost city), as my bard found a book of secret lore about Atlantis. Now, I was initially opposed to this, as the lvl 6 Lore Bard Magical secrets is a really really really important class feature, and I felt that my agency was being taken away by him making spells for me, instead of me just picking the ones I wanted, but he's a good DM, we talked it out. He was just excited about it is all! So originally I was going to take Fireball and Enlarge/Reduce, but instead he and I homebrewed the two spells, and I need help with one of them. The one we are already happy with is essentially a temp hp buff he can give on touch that refreshes the temp hp at the beginning of the turn, and the affected creature can use a reaction to spout water and push an attacker away (Think False Life+Non-Damaging Hellish Rebuke). The spell I need some input on is his replacement to Fireball and this is the text for it (think of it as fireball, but steam. Same casting time/range/etc): "" A pressurized stream of water spouts from your finger to a point you choose within range, then pops with a roar into an explosion of steam. Each creature in a 20 foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 4d6 fire and 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a sucessful save. Undead and constructs have resistance (or he's saying maybe immunity) to the fire damage from this spell, while creatures of the elemental creature type that are composed of fire have vulnerability to the fire damage from this spell. This spell ignores resistance or immunity to fire damage from those creatures with the elemental creature type. The steam spreads around corners. It douses open flames in the area. "" I understand why constructs and undead would be maybe resistant to the fire damage, because yknow, its steam, not fire, which would'nt damage a big metal golem, or a zombie as much as a fireball would. My problem is, elementals are not super common in our campaign, and neither are constructs, but undead are easy to come by in most campaigns (ours included) and I just dont see why i would take this spell over fireball. I would really appreciate a way to make this spell a little better, a bit more in line with fireball, it's just I'm not sure how. I've been talking about it with my DM, but he's a little stuck because he really wants to hang on to that resistance/immunity with constructs and undead. I don't really like it, but it makes sense and I'll deal, I just really want to come to a good solution because Magical Secrets are arguably the best Bard feature, and it's important for me to make sure I don't feel shafted because of a homebrew spell. I'm open to any suggestions about the spell, so please pick it apart if you want, and suggest some better options! (Also, my DM is amazing, he's not intentionally trying to cheat me out of a magical secret, he's just heavy on the lore and RP in this game and wants my magical secrets to make sense. Which I'm okay with, I just want the spell to not be a shittier fireball that's still 3rd level)."

I regret giving them a magical item that could give vulnerability to any damage type &amp;#x200B; where do I start? &amp;#x200B; me and my friends are relatively inexperienced in DnD and I even less at writing my own home-brew campaign. regardless, we were pretty early on in the campaign, they had to chase down a particularly deep scion named Akani who both stole an incredibly powerful artefact that could flood the entire world and killed an NPC close the my player's hearts. So my players were eager to chase him, they had tracked him to an old dungeon on an island filled with deep sea threats. well, the party, at this moment in time a group of 5, which consisted of 2 bards, a warlock, a sorcerer and a ranger. (No tank, but the characters are cool enough that I don't care) the dungeon, went absolutely amazing, the encounters worked out the way I had planned them. and they went serious on the puzzle I had given them (one of them was kind of improvised and dumb but it was very short so it didn't matter). they had finally, after completing a poem and fighting off some home-brew enchanted ballistas and a home-brew air elemental, reached the boss room. the BBEG was channeling a spell that would teleport him out of the room and leave a mechanical threat as the final boss. I had given him the turn so he could gloat at the players when he succeeded. &amp;#x200B; one turn. one turn was all they needed apparently &amp;#x200B; deep scions have around 70 health(67 I believe?). so how do 5 level 3 characters deal 70 damage in 1 turn? two words: Heat metal before this, the PC's had an encounter with a revenant taking over the body of a friend of one of the PC's (aptly named Craig) and after resolving the conflict, they were rewarded with some treasure. a revenant's glowing eye. that could give any character vulnerability to any damage type. real dangerous if used correctly and before that, my ranger got hold of some powerful poison explosive arrows 3d6 poison damage (he was playing unrevised ranger and because he was new, I wanted to give him some power so that he wouldn't feel useless). &amp;#x200B; all of this culminated into one moment, one turn to let loose all of my over generosity into derailing my campaign. you see, the BBEG was wearing metal, he needed a medallion to activate the mechanical guardian and so he was wearing that. seeing this. my players instantly began planning as the warlock revealed the situation through his sneaky familiar. they needed to maximise every single point of potential damage and I had given them every tool to do so. a few rolls later and they surprise the BBEG, give the BBEG vulnerability to fire damage(using up the action from of the bards), cast heat metal roll a 7 and an 8 on the initial damage roll, tallying up to about 30 damage already, another high-rolled explosive arrow later and we're at 54 damage, the warlock fires an eldritch blast, hitting and dealing some more damage, and then the second heat metal trigger came, dealing even more damage and charring The BBEG to cinders. so now my players have a doomsday weapon and a campaign in shreds. &amp;#x200B; yay for me having to write more now..."

I am a first time 5e D&amp;D DM who would like some ideas and or feedback on my campaign idea and help with monster builds (if any of my players are here - leave now!). In a nutshell: The main antagonists of my campaign are going to be a vampire cult - the homebrew part comes with the monsters involved. My idea is that the cult was started initially by a lone child vampire (6yr old girl), recently turned and alone in the woods, who is lonely and looking for companions. As such she began trying to turn anything she wanted in a child-like desire to keep them with her forever - a pet wolf being the first. From this beginning a cult has surrounded this girl and believes in the sanctity of family and blood, and sees vampirism as the highest form of life. As vampires are always humanoid in official rules, I wanted some ideas as to how it may work with other life forms. I had the thought that eventually she would want all sorts to join her 'family', with the ultimate goal of having at least one of every known life form. I am playing with the concept that while over time the process could be perfected, at least initially there would be difficulties with turning non-humanoids to true vampires - instead there may be varying degrees of mutation which would happen over time. I was thinking of some vampiric traits/weaknesses based on the level of success (i.e. hp regen but sunlight vulnerability, necrotic damage but without max hp drain etc) or some mutated form of undead for failed experiments (increased aggressiveness/bloodlust, troll-like regen etc). Any thoughts from the community on cool hybrids that can escalate as the campaign progresses? N.B. For context - I have a huge barely manageable group of 7 players (eek!) who are starting at 3rd level and the setting (for those who are familiar) is Tal'dorei from Critical Role (set some 150yrs after VM - the vamp escaped from Whitestone).

Skin Lacquers fall into several categories: Resistance, Enhancement, Grandiose, Mixed, and Misc/Special. Lacquers can take up to a short rest apply, and are permanent. Below is the list of Types of Lacquers- Resistance: Applies a resistance to a type of damage. This can be any type of damage.

(These are Uncommon) Mixed: Has multiple of the listed affects. (These Vary from Very Rare to Legendary) Misc/Special: Has a different affect from the others. (There are Rare) Below i will list types of Lacquers and their basic descriptions. I will apply ""grade"" markers to indicate the rarity comparison. After that list i will provide a list of more specific Lacquers and their affects. * Resistance Lacquers: 1. Basic resistance Lacquer: Applies resistance to a chosen damage type. 2. Grade 2 Resistance Lacquer: Applies 2 resistances, and 1 vulnerability. 3. Grade 3 Resistance Lacquer(Rarest): Applies 2 resistances and no vulnerability. * Enhancement Lacquer: 1.

Basic Skin Dye Lacquer: Allows the change of color of skin in a permanent manner. 2. Grade 2 Skin Dye Lacquer: Allows a combination of colors to dye the skin or specific sections of the body to be colored a specific way. * Mixed: **Special information:** *Mixed Lacquers have subcategories which detail the affects. I.e: Buffs, Shielding, and Reparation.* **Buffs:** 1. Basic Mixed Skin Lacquer: Applies a resistance to one type of damage and adds a +1 to one stat type. 2. Grade 2 Skin Lacquer: Applies Resistance to one type of damage and adds a +2 to one stat or +1 to any 2. 3.

Basic Mixed Skin Lacquer: Removes 1 Vulnerability and Applies a coloration to the skin. 2. Grade 2 Skin Lacquer: Removes 2 Vulnerabilities, Applies 1 resistance, and dyes the skin. Misc/Special: 1. Basic Lacquer remover: Removes a lacquer entirely within 1 minute. 2. Lacquer Inverter: Inverts the affect of a Lacquer: I.e: Resistance becomes vulnerability, vulnerability becomes resistance. 3. Grade 3 Overhaul Lacquer: This lacquer can apply a single resistance to a damage type, remove an invulnerability, or Apply a immunity to a single damage type that is already resisted. 4. Grade 4 Overhaul Lacquer: Can apply up to 2 resistances, repair up to 2 vulnerabilities, but can only apply 1 immunity to a type of damage already resisted. 5. Curse Lacquer: Applies -1 or more affects to selected stats. 6. Conditional Lacquer: Applies an affect of the Lacquers but it is under a specific condition. From here i will list skin lacquers I've come up with, and will edit to add any more, giving credit to anyone who provides an idea i approve. I will also list specific types of creatures a lacquer would be advantageous to use on. 1. Tiefling Lacquer: Applies a red coloration to the skin, and provides fire resistance. 2. Celestial Lacquer: Applies a shininess to the skin, and provides resistance to Radiant and Necrotic damage. 3. Lacquer of Undead: Applies a paleness to the skin, Resistance to Necrotic damage, and a vulnerability to bludgeoning and radiant damage. 4. Gargoyle's Touch Lacquer: Provides a gray stone-like coloration to the skin, and provides resistance to Non-magical Piercing, Slashing, and Bludgeoning. 5. Steel Statue Lacquer: Provides a Silvery reflective color to the skin, and removes a vulnerability to a damage type, or provides a resistance to a damage type instead. 6. Jester's Lacquer: Applies a colorful sheen to the skin and provides a +2 to Charisma. 7. God's skin: Applies immunity to radiant damage. 8. Be all-end all: Provides immunity to one type of damage. 9.

His orange eye sits in the center of the band glowing with bloodlust and rage. Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 25. ***Armor and Weapon Forms*** On your first turn in combat, you may expend one charge to urge Vethalon to transform into his gauntlet form. You must succeed on a DC 5 Charisma saving throw or the charge is wasted. If you succeed, Vethalon becomes a heavy black gauntlet with red claws and spikes. His orange eye blazes, casting bright light for 5 feet and dim light for an additional 5 feet. The gauntlet grants you a +2 to AC and unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d10 fire damage. On your first turn in combat, you may expend two charges to urge Vethalon to transform into his piercing lance form. You must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or the charges are wasted. If you succeed, Vethalon becomes a 10-foot long black lance with red spines. Vethalon's orange eye is embedded in your forearm. The eye burns brightly with orange fire, casting bright light for 10 feet and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The piercing lance is an extension of your arm. The lance increases your movement speed by 10 feet. ***Possessed Form*** Vethalon The Skull-Breaker may attempt to possess you in a moment of weakness or vulnerability. You must give Vethalon your consent, although he may trick you into doing so. Your form changes into a hybrid of your humanoid form and his demonic form. See To control yourself at any point, you must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw, otherwise, actions are decided by your Dungeon Master. ***Sentience*** Vethalon The Skull-Breaker is a sentient chaotic evil wondrous item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. Vethalon has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. Vethalon can speak, read, and understand common, infernal, and any language you can speak, read, and understand. Vethalon The Skull-Breaker hungers for blood, violence, and gore. If Vethalon goes 24 hours without breaking a skull, you are forced to make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or immediately make an unarmed strike against the closest creature. This attack automatically crits and deals an additional 3d10 fire damage. If this attack does not render the target's skull broken, you are forced to make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or immediately make an unarmed strike against the closest creature. This attack automatically crits and deals an additional 5d10 fire damage. This cycle of increasing saving throw DC and unarmed strike (including increasing fire damage) repeats until the creature's skull is broken. ***Personality*** Vethalon The Skull-Breaker is extremely arrogant believing himself to be superior to everyone and is easily provoked, and repeatedly mocks you. Vethalon will take any opportunity to possess you, wreak carnage, and break skulls. *Notes: Damage: Unarmed Attacks, The number of charges is equal to your Proficiency Bonus., Requires Attunement By A Barbarian, Fighter, or Monk, Buff, Handwear* [URL"

Then have him convince the non-infected party member to help him remove the creatures from them. * Have them turn into a sentient undead and turn it into an ""evil"" campaign. This might add some interesting character drama.(Though I would still need to talk about it to the players about this.) * Have them make a Wis save or a Con save at the end of a long rest. Succeeding this would allow them to temporary deal with the slime but have an additional side effect such as having new powers that involve necrotic or ooze-like nature. &amp;#8203; Olive Slime Infestation: Any amount of olive slime that remains in contact with a potential victim for more than two minutes charms the victim and alters his or her thinking patterns so that the hosts main concern becomes feeding and protecting the olive slimeincluding keeping the slime hidden from companions. If anyone tries to remove the olive slime from the host, the host does whatever is required to protect the slime, whether its running away or fighting back. As long as the host is alive and conscious, it will do everything in its power to protect the slime, including knocking out or even killing its friends. An infested creature suffers the following effects.  It loses 1 point of Constitution immediately when the infestation begins and another 1d6 points of Constitution at the end of each 24-hour period, as the growing olive slime replaces the creatures skin, muscle, and organs with olive slime. The olive slime gains hit points equal to the number of Constitution points lost by the victim.  The host must double its normal food intake or lose 1 extra point of Constitution after each 24 hours. Also, the host does not recover hit points or hit dice after a long rest if it didnt double its food intake.  If the hosts Constitution drops to 0, the host dies. Five minutes later, its body reanimates as an olive slime zombie. Olive slime can be burned, cut away, or frozen. Anything that damages the olive slime deals half damage to its host (before doubling for vulnerability in the case of acid, cold, or fire damage). Greater restoration ends the olive slimes charm effect for two minutes; during that time, the victim can cooperate with attempts to remove the slime."

The hatered and cold incarnate. They are 5th level Rogue assassin and now taking 2nd level Warlock great old one. &amp;#x200B; When they made the pact, it was because Delban resurrected the PC. Now she exudes cold, all of her spells are cold/ice flavoured. But she has aversion to fire and has vulnerability to fire damage. I told her that each level will come with a change in her. Something good and something bad. She was very reluctant to take more levels, but now she decided that she needs it. So I need some help. I described to her, that when she woke up she felt a flash of pain and then nothing. That she has a scar on her abdomen and sternum in the shape of Delban's symbol(Basically a version of underbreast tattoo). Also that everytime she moves, she feels every vein in her body, as the blood cracks from being frozen. It does not cause any damage to her. She wants to take Armour of Shadows, which casts mage armor so for a flavour it works great with the frozen blood as being more sturdy. I still need something from the patron. I was thinking about either immunity, or resistance to poison. As it won't be as good as spreading around her body, but I have nothing appropriate to balance it out. I was thinking about either fall damage vulnerability, or bludgeoning damage vulnerability. But I am not sure it is not too much. Or something more RP related. Her being more petty, and holding grudges and acting on them, for revenge. But I don't know how to really police it, or rather keep her honest about it. There is one more thing that she does not know about. She has a wild magic property. I found a list of wild magic surges that are more appropriate for a warlock. But as she did not cast any leveled spells until now, I could not inform her about it. Maybe instead, I could use it and tell her that is the balancing thing. If it isn't too much. Any help is welcome."

Nallimar Philarran can use its action to Polymorph into a spider-humanoid hybrid, or a Large Aranae, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its Statistics are the same in each form. Any Equipment it is wearing or carrying isnt transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies. #### Spellcasting (Human or Hybrid Forms Only). Nallimar Philarran is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). Nallimar Philarran has the following Wizard spells prepared: Cantrips (at will): Acid Splash, Message, Poison Spray, Shocking Grasp1st level (4 slots): Color Spray, Magic Missile, Shield2nd level (3 slots): Acid Arrow, Misty Step, Web3rd level (2 slots): Fear, Stinking Cloud #### Spider Climb (Hybrid or Aranae Forms Only). Nallimar Philarran can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. #### Web Sense (Hybrid or Aranae Forms Only). While in contact with a web, Nallimar Philarran knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. #### Web Walker (Hybrid or Aranae Forms Only). Nallimar Philarran ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing. #### Multiattack. Nallimar Philarran makes a different amount of attacks in different forms. In human form, it makes one Melee or Ranged Attack with its Dagger, or uses one Spell. In Hybrid form, it makes one spell attack and one Acid Spray attack. In Aranae form, it makes either one Acid Spray attack or one Bite attack, and either one Web attack or one Constrict attack, when possible. #### Dagger. *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* \+6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. #### Bite (Aranae Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way. #### Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6) (Hybid or Aranae Forms Only). The spider sprays acid in a 30' long line 5' wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) acid damage on a failure and half that on a success. In addition, if the target fails the save, it is coated in acid and suffers 9 (2d8) acid damage at the start of each of its turn. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the save, ending the effect on a success. A creature can also end the effect by spending its action to take an appropriate action. #### Web (Recharge 5-6) (Hybrid or Aranae Form Only). Ranged Weapon Attack: +0 to hit, range 30'/60', one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained creature can make a DC 15 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10, hp 15, vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to bludgeoning, poison and psychic damage). #### Constrict (Recharge 10) (Aranae Form Only). Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is grappled. For the next three turns, the target is covered in webbing below the Aranae's body. Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and Nallimar Philarran can't constrict another target (escape DC 14 on first turn, 18 on second, 22 on third, 26 subsequent) or use the Web attack. On the fourth turn, the target is attached to the ceiling. The webbing can be attacked and destroyed (AC 10, hp (15 on first turn, 30 second, 45 third, 60 subsequent), vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to bludgeoning, poison and psychic damage), however the target of the constrict attack will take damage equal to the damage dealt to the web. The target is suffocated by the webbing, and is unable to breathe."

After you kill a monster, you may take 10 minutes (not in a short rest) to record it in your Bestiary before leaving the area. Make a Monster Knowledge check, with a DC equal to 10 + the monster's CR - the number of times it is listed in your Bestiary. If you succeed, you learn one damage immunity, resistance, or vulnerability of the DM's choosing each time you study a corpse. #### Slayer's Training When you choose this subclass at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the Herbalism Kit and Alchemist's Supplies. You also gain proficiency in Survival, or expertise if you are already proficient. Additionally, you can use Dexterity instead of Strength when using a longsword. #### Darkvision At 3rd level, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, its range is increased by 30 feet. #### Signs You gain access to additional spells at 3rd, 5th, 9th, and 13th levels. Once you gain a Sign, it counts as a Ranger spell for you, but doesn't count against the number of Ranger spells you know. 3rd - Igni (Fire Bolt), Quen (Shield) 5th - Axii (Suggestion) 9th - Aard (Psionic Blast) 13th - Yrden (Confusion) You also have 1 Sign Point at level 3. You can expend Sign Points equal to the Sign's level instead of expending a spell slot. You gain an additional Sign Point at 5th, 9th, and 13th levels. All Sign Points are replenished after a Short or Long Rest. #### Monster Slayer's Intuition At 5th level, you can activate your Monster Slayer's Intuition as an action. You gain truesight and blindsight out to a range of 1 foot, and have advantage on Perception checks that rely on hearing or sight. While Monster Slayer's Intuition is active, you cannot take actions, bonus actions, or reactions until you take an action to dismiss Monster Slayer's Intuition. The radius of blindsight and truesight increases to 5 feet at 11th level and 10 feet at 17th level. #### Expert Tracking At 7th level, you have advantage on Investigation, Perception, and Survival checks to track monsters that are in your Bestiary. #### Witcher's Constitution At 11th level, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws. Additionally, you can add half your Constitution modifier (rounded down) to any hit dice you expend during a short rest. #### Monster Slayer Attack Beginning at 15th level, you can attack thrice, instead of twice, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn against a monster in your Bestiary."

A very, tasty combination for two reasons. **NOTICE** Skip to the last part if you dont want to read my dramatic build up of this ability. AHEM! Picture it, a Warlock standing upon a rock ledge in the Dragons lair, as the Warlock looks over this high ledge down at his party, he sees that the party is wavering, the Cleric is out of spell slots and has low HP, the Rogue is unconscious, the Barbarian is drawing attention but is also at 2/5 HP, and the Bard is frantically playing the lute trying to Charm or Calm the Emotions of this ravenous ancient dragon... The Warlock, feeling the blood run down his face, and the concussion is starting to become noticeable, he outstretches his arms... And he says, one, simple, thing. It is your time, to meet the Queen and black mist encompasses his arms. Looking back at the Dragon, you see, two, gigantic black shadows of sinister gauntlets appear beside this Dragon, and a faint white mask behind it; these two massive gauntlets, slowly lower down, casting the Barbarian into darkness, the Dragon now clawing, whipping and gnawing at these spectral hands, it turns to her... The Queen; and as it does, the hands just, oh so gently, tap... The Dragons scaly hide. Blackened energy rushes across the body, engulfing it in shadow, the shadows whip about, slightly muffling the screams of this beast, and then they finally implode; as if a portal had just been closed... The hands and mask fade, as theres now only, a ravens feather in the dragons place. **TO THE ABILITY** Taking 14 levels in Warlock, and choosing the Raven Queen as your patron (UA). Taking 2 levels in Fighter for Action Surge. At 13th level, Warlocks choose a 7th level spell. Choose Finger of Death; now using the 14th level Patron ability, and Action Surge, cast two Finger of Deaths... Thats 14d8 + 60 Necrotic Damage, or half on a successful save. Max damage: 172 Necrotic Average: 116 Necrotic Lowest possible: 74 Necrotic *Half them all if the target succeeds the save* So yeah, just nuke a guy or two guys. Fun stuff.

The player in question is considering playing a Blood Hunter. One of my players wants to play a Witcher-esque character in an upcoming campaign. He wants to use a system that follows the silver weapons of the game, but expanded to different enemies. Now I had two possible systems in mind: - Give resistance and vulnerability to creature types. For example, if he uses a silver sword against a lycan, deal vulnerability damage. If he uses it against a humanoid, deal resisted damage. The idea is that for each creature that becomes vulnerable, there is another that becomes resistant and another that takes normal damage. I'm not married to this system. I feel as though vulnerability is too powerful, and resistance too easily bypassed. I am considering adding attunement, but I also don't want to use up his attunement slots before the campaign even starts. OR -Have the weapon deal an extra 3d4 to a specific type of creature, subtract 2d6 damage to another type of creature, and subtract 1d4 damage to all other types of creatures. I like this system better, as I feel it gives a decent bonus without being overpowered. Again, one type of creature would be faced with extra damage, one type with highly reduced damage, but everything else still takes reduced damage. My main problem with this system is that I fear the dice might become too low for higher levels of play. I've been playing with the idea of having the dice increase with character level, but I'd still like to hear feedback. If anyone can give thoughts on either system, or suggest their own, please feel free too! All help is appreciated."

I used to be a level 10 druid, but in an earlier boss battle I rolled a nat 1 to dodge a jumping stomp attack from a demon lord and then the DM rolled a nat 20 to hit so basically I was immediately killed. One of my party members salvaged my torso and threw me through a portal back into the over world where we were helping a dwarven stronghold. Both of my friends were trapped in the abyss and I was slowly rebuilt by the dwarves the best they could do and I changed my class to Paladin and Barbarian because I felt that fit and I was tired of Druid. I upgraded to full plate after our first encounter with a lich because 17 AC is shit for a tank. In the current party we have a level 9 or 10 barbarian and he took like 2 or 3 levels in war cleric. (My god for my Paladin is an irl god called Ogun and he's the god of iron, warriors, craftsmen, ale, and ale making) My main question is how can I still use my rage in my full plate. My reasoning is that as a warforged you don't just wear armor therefore I don't have the regular encumbrance that a normal human would have. You have to take time to integrate the armor into your body so you don't gain exhaustion from wearing while you sleep and you can't be disarmed if you're captured. As a backup if he doesn't let me I might go full paladin because I can get that divine strike which is an extra d8, plus we're currently doing a hell campaign, however vulnerability is a very weird system in 5e. I'm just wondering what other people's thoughts are and wondering what other potential rp explain"

Anytime you use magic within an hour of the casting of the original spell, you are met with the murmured approval and commentary of the voices. 76  You grow rabbit ears that give you advantage on all Perception rolls relating to sounds for one hour. 77  You cast Fire Shield. 78  All books within 120ft are transformed; they all have you as the protagonist! 79  You summon the following within 5ft of you: 1 Backpack, 1 Barrel, 1 Bedroll, 1 Blanket, 1 Breastplate, 1 Crowbar, 1 Drum, 1 Insect Repellant-Incense, 1 Steel Mirror and 1 Potion of Healing. 80  You turn into an elf for 1 hour. Your facial features and body shape are still distinctly you, but youre obviously also an elf. You gain Darkvision for up to 60ft and proficiency with the Perception skill. If youre already an elf youre even more elven (you decide what that means). 81  You gain a faint halo. If a fiend approaches within 30ft it takes 6d6 radiant damage and the halo vanishes. 82  You cast the following spells on yourself. They last for 1 hour and dont require concentration; Comprehend Languages, Detect Evil and Good, Detect Poison and Disease, Find Traps. 83  You drop everything you are holding and are teleported 60ft to a place you can see. 84  A tree rapidly sprouts from the ground under you and grows to its full size of 10 ft. within seconds. You must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw (DC 12) or become entangled in the tree crown. 85  You summon 40 fey creatures from the Feywild and the Shadowfell. The fey from the Feywild take the shape of white bunnies and the Shadowfell fey take the shape of squirrels. They hate each other and will fight to each other to the death. They vanish back to their respective realms after 10 minutes. 86  You gain two points of Exhaustion. 87  You become blind for 1 minute. 88  Your eye colour changes. This can be removed by a Remove Curse spell. 89  You summon a random +1 weapon. 90  You summon a random +1 armour. 91  All water within 120ft turn to wine for 1 hour. 92  You can walk on water for 1d20 days. 93 - A phantasmal force moves up to you and pushes you over. How rude! You are prone. 94  You gain the effects of a short rest. 95  You have to move at least 30ft each round for 1 minute. 96  You grow long claws for 1 minute. These are finesse weapons and do 5d6 poison damage in addition to your Dexterity modifier. 97  You become deaf for 1 hour. 98  You lose the ability to cast cantrips for 1 hour. 99  You cast Snillocs Snowball Swarm on the target closest to you. 00  You instantly casts three additional spells, but cant cast any other spells for 1 hour."
85,vulnerability,DnD,Magic Weapon Idea (Criticism Wanted),1,ec1w60,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ec1w60/magic_weapon_idea_criticism_wanted/,2019-12-18 08:00:16,"Greetings travelers! I'm a DM for a lovely group of four adventurers. One of my adventurers has stumbled across a cursed sentient crown that has made a deal with her. The sentient crown is inhabited by the Drow Demi-God Kiarenselee, a necromancer who had an army of undead. The player made a deal with the Drow where she is able to use the necromancer's power to summon forth a weapon of pure darkness. I want this weapon to have a really cool thematic ability. My thought for the magic weapon is such: *Halberd, Rare* When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you may spend any number of remaining hit dice as necrotic damage. If you expend your last remaining hit dice in this way, you become *hollow*, as the necromantic energy takes its toll on you. *Hollow*: You gain immunity to Necrotic damage and vulnerability to Radiant damage. The player is a 5th (soon to be 6th) level champion fighter. What are your thoughts? Too strong? Too weak?"

One of our group used a wish to cast a simulacrum. Now it states that it gains your class/ race features. It also states that a simulacrum has weaknesses and features of its own like cold damage and resistance to cold, vulnerable to fire ect. The guy who cast it had some resistance to fire damage. Now the issue we had was that he cast flame cloak around the thing, it also got hit with a fireball or two and didn't take the vulnerability. Would it melt because it has a vulnerability to fire or would it stay safe because it gains all the class/race stuff including resistance to fire?"
87,vulnerability,DnD,"Highest damage output from Melee attack using spells and less than or equal to 8 party members, using only officially published material and no scrolls",1,edhxa6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/edhxa6/highest_damage_output_from_melee_attack_using/,2019-12-21 10:33:10,"For a few days, I've been wondering what the highest damage output from a single round of combat from one player using a melee attack, using the information of only the official content. This is forgetting about the dice or chances (the odds of this happening are pretty much impossible), but here's what I got: Firstly, the one doing the big round of damage is a Paladin 17, Fighter 2, Barbarian multiclass. This character needs to have interacted with a Deck of Many Things to make its Strength score 24, with a modifier of +7. Secondly, they need a +3 Great Sword. This character, who we will call Bob, needs also to know the Banishing Smite spell. Nextly, we need six, yes six, Bard 20's with the Heat Metal spell known and all of their spell slots unused. Furthermore, we need a Wizard to know the spell Haste and prepare it. Preparation: Before the battle, a bard must give Bob a d12 bardic inspiration die. On turn 1, the Wizard casts Haste on Bob. Then, Bob must use his Rage feature from Barbarian, and then attack something to maintain the rage (low level Barbarians must hit something each turn to extend the rage to its fullest). The first bard will then cast Heat Metal as a 9th level spell on Bob's great sword. The other 5 will take prepare the Heat Metal spell as a 9th level spell, set to activate when the last Heat Metal expires and when Bob strikes. The foe is a fiend (any fiend which does not have resistance to any type of damage and vulnerability to radiant damage will do) On turn 2, the wizard has to twiddle his thumbs while Bob goes ham. Bob casts Banishing Smite and then makes his first attack. If rolls a critical hit (4d6) and then adds the modifiers (+3 bonus, +7 strength, +6 proficiency bonus, +2 barbarian Rage bonus), and rolls the maximum, and factors in 1d12 bardic inspiration, this will be 54 slashing damage. If then he uses Divine Smite and expends a 4th level spell slots and rolls the max on that (plus the 1d8 from striking a fiend), this amounts to 80 radiant damage (vulnerability to radiant damage). Plus the Banishing Smite spell dealing 5d10 force damage raises the amount by 50 at maximum. Then, the Heat Metal spell deals 9d8 fire damage by touching the foe, to a max of 72. The first hit deals 336 damage. This is but the beginning. Bob's Extra Attack feature allows him to attack a second time. He deals 42 damage on the initial attack, plus another 80 radiant damage due to Divine Smite. One of the Bard's Heat Metal activates and deals 152 more fire damage. This is a total of 274 damage on the extra attack. Using the benefits from Haste, Bob attacks again. Bob casts Staggering Smite (due to a lack of 5th level spell slots) then gets a critical hit, benefits from rage, uses Divine Smite (expending a 3rd level spell and benefitting from the fiend's vulnerability) and then gets maximum on every roll. Then, the next Bard casts Heat Metal and helps by dealing 152 fire damage. This comes down to 282 on the first attack, then uses Extra Attack and uses Divine Smite again and the fourth Heat Metal takes effect, to deal 258 damage total. Haste overall helps the effort by 540. Then, using Action Surge from Fighter, Bob attacks a third time. The first attack (using a 3rd level Divine Smite, Blinding Smite, and a 5th Heat Metal) comes down to 282 damage total. Then, using Extra Attack, he uses 2nd level Divine Smite and the final Heat Metal is cast and that comes down to the extra attack adding 242 damage. Action Surge adds 324 damage total. Once all is done, once Bob's normal attack and extra attack, his Haste attack and extra attack, and his Action Surge attack and extra attack have been taken, alongside three smiting spells, 6 Divine Smites, and six 9th level Heat Metal spells have been used, Bob has expended all of his 5th, 4th, and 3rd spells and a few 2nd level spells in one turn to deal... 1,474 damage. After all of that, after every roll being perfect and getting a critical hit every time, with everything going perfectly, in less than 1 second (according to one round being 6 seconds and there being 9 fighters in a round), Bob kills Tiamat at least twice over. That is truly insane. Feel free to check my math or provide another way to deal this much damage with these restrictions!"

You can use a bonus action to speak this magic swords command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40 feet radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 1d4 fire damage to any target it hits. If the target has resistance to fire damage the sword ignors the resistance and deals 2d4 fire damage instead. If the target has immunity to fire damage the sword feals insulted, dealing 2d4 fire damage instead additionally the target has vulnerability to the fire damage dealt by this weapon. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword. **Sentience**: A former elder fire elemental not wanting to obey its efreet master was imprisoned in the efreets Saber to form a firey sword. Wanting to exact vengeance on its imprisoner but not being able to free itself, the elemental turned the sword flames near white through its burning hatred.

Some ways to make them both unnerving have been that cybermen particularly like children, reproduce very easily, and will play the long game, daleks are immovable in their hatred of everything, are tech experts (this could apply to magic items or artificers), can fly, and both are resistant to non-magical weapons. Some weaknesses that players could exploit that I've found are a vulnerability to lightning damage (cybers), irrational hatred of each other akin to beholders (daleks), lack of creativity (cybers), and really awkward movement (both although without costume restraints this might be negated). Any ideas for using these guys in a campaign or very similar monsters in an engaging and challenging way?"
91,vulnerability,DnD,Youth Pastor looking for feedback on introducing D&amp;D to parents,83,dsmvom,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dsmvom/youth_pastor_looking_for_feedback_on_introducing/,2019-11-07 08:26:55,"So, I am a youth pastor at a small Lutheran church in Washington DC, and about a month ago I started a D&amp;D campaign for my students. It's going well so far, which is to say that the kids like it and I haven''t been accused of wichcraft or satanism (not that this is likely as its a rather progressive church), but while a few of the parents rolled dice back in their college days most are entirely unfamiliar with the game and confused as to why it would be part of a church program. I've put together an explanation for why I think D&amp;D is an asset for my (and any really) youth program, and was wondering if any folks here would be able to give feedback: what about D&amp;D is helpful (or dangerous) to teen emotional and social development that I have not yet included? What metaphors or tools have folks used to successfully explain the positive aspects of the hobby to others that I could incorporate? &gt;The text of the missive that I plan to send out to parents: &gt; &gt;One of the activities that we have begun doing regularly in the --- youth group is a game known as Dungeons and Dragons. This may have seemed an oddity to some, as it is not an activity traditionally associated with youth group programs. In the next few paragraphs I will attempt to explain why I have chosen to include this game in our youth group meetings and activities at ---. &gt; &gt;D&amp;D, as it is often abbreviated, is a tabletop roleplaying game, or a game in which one person narrates a story, and others play the role of characters in that story. In D&amp;D, that story is of a medieval fantasy world and a band of adventuring heroes that is made up by the players, with conflicts that arise in the story being decided by the rolling of dice and pre-determined attributes of each character. It is at its core collaborative storytelling, and all the bells and whistles of the game system exist to enhance the ability of a narrator and players to tell compelling and fun stories together. &gt; &gt;So, weve established that D&amp;D is very nerdy, but why is it in a youth ministry program? There are three primary reasons why I have chosen to include the playing of this game in our curriculum. First, D&amp;D is a game that creates a space that is both highly social and minimizes social vulnerability. The game is highly social because nearly the entirety of gameplay involves players talking to one another either as their characters or about the game, providing a structure and channel for easy social engagement. It minimizes social vulnerability because players are able to step conceptually outside of themselves and into the facsimile of another person, and are therefore able to express themselves while being removed from the usual anxieties and fears that are ubiquitous in the social lives of youth: if your character does something silly and gets laughed at, you can join in the laughter knowing that you are not really them. &gt; &gt;This ability to engage socially feeds into the second reason why I include D&amp;D, which is that it enables organic exploration of concepts of ethics, identity, and worldview on the part of youth. In playing another person in a fantasy setting, students are able to explore, encounter, and wrestle with ethical quandries (e.g. a starving pickpocket tried to rob us, do we let them go, or report them to the town guards?) , diverse identities (e.g. playing a character of different gender/age/personality than yourself), social and logical challenges (e.g. we need to get into a castle but the guard wont grant us entry, how can we persuade him?), and competing ideologies and approaches to life (e.g. how do we approach faith, money, or our relationships with authority?) in a safe, low-stakes environment where the worst thing that can happen is having to make a new character. &gt; &gt;The third reason I included D&amp;D in ---s youth curriculum is because of a common complaint that I heard from youth in my first weeks as youth ministry developer. Repeatedly I was told that what the youth wanted out of the youth group was a greater sense of agency and ownership over the direction and content of the program. D&amp;D to me seemed like an excellent way to help fulfill this desire: Everything that happens and every development in the story of a D&amp;D game is determined by the agency of the players. It is a game where you can decide to go where you want, explore the parts of the world that you want to, engage with the plot that interests you, and act creatively to shape the story into the shape you want it to be. Player agency is the core of the game, and I have often heard it likened to a sort of social sandbox. I, as the narrator (or game master) provide the framework and setting for the players, and everything from there on out is decided by them. &gt; &gt;For these three reasons (and, if Im honest a fourth reason, which is that I really like playing the game myself), I have chosen to include D&amp;D (and variants thereof) as a part of the --- youth group curriculum going forward. It is both a fun game and an excellent developmental tool for youth who are in life stages that feature high emotional and social vulnerability. I hope that this has assuaged any anxieties and/or clarified any confusion you may have felt about the introduction of this activity, and if you have any further comments or questions please feel free to contact me by text or email, or drop by during my office hours from ------------------------."
92,vulnerability,DnD,A list of the best low-CR creatures to use as Big Bad Evil Guys.,1,duxtgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/duxtgu/a_list_of_the_best_lowcr_creatures_to_use_as_big/,2019-11-12 06:50:59,"Not every adventure has to be about the end of the world. Maybe this is a stepping stone to bigger things. Or you just want to make an antagonist with a sense of vulnerability. Either way, there's times when you want your biggest, baddest, evilest guy to be not that strong. But when most of the classic bad guys like liches and dragons are practically demigods, and the lowest level creatures are little more minions, what can you turn to for your BBEG? For this post I'm defining ""low CR"" as 5 or less. I'll be starting at 5 and working down. Obviously this isn't to say these creatures are always a natural fit for this role, or that creatures I haven't mentioned won't work. This is just a list of personal picks. Also, damn near any creature can be homebrewed and modified to be a good BBEG, so while I might tough lightly on a creature's potential for customisation, I'll mostly try and look at these things as they are written. I'll be considering creatures from the Monster Manual, Volo's Guide, and Mordenkainen's Tome. One last thing before we start. There's npc templates and humanoid enemies and stuff that I won't be listing. As far as I am concerned, the lowliest bandit to the drow elite warrior, all kinds of orc or goblin or kobold, the myriad types of spellcaster npc, are all perfectly fine, possibly even excellent as BBEGs, but it's the versatility of humanoids that makes them, and they're good for mostly all the same reasons and I don't want to repeat myself. *** **CR 5** *** There's no shortage of versatile and strong villains in this category, level 5 is right about when the players start to face bigger threats. Since these creatures are just starting to break into higher tiers of play, the seldom need much adjusting. Picking out good antagonists is going to get harder from here. **-Adult Oblex**. Just look at that stat block. High Intelligence, multiple languages, impersonation, and spellcasting, infiltrators don't get much better than this. Despite being an ooze, an oblex is perfectly capable of being a villainous mastermind who can match wits against adventurers well above their CR. They're great antagonists for all kinds, can preside over a dungeon or even a whole city, and are exactly the thing you need if you want to eventually transition into a higher level Mind Flayer themed campaign. **-Cambion**. Just the thing you need for your demon cult leader, or a false prophet of the tieflings, or the leader of a small invasion of devils, or any number of other roles. Physically powerful in an stand-up fight, but also with some sneaky magical abilities like a potent charm and Alter Self that lets it blend in and work behind the scenes. **-Kraken Priest**. Having a kraken fight isn't really fair at low levels, but you can still have the looming threat of one as a powerful motivator, which is where the Kraken Priest comes in. They pair up exceptionally well with Sea Spawn minions if you really want to dig into that body horror flavour. A kraken priest can even be the face and voice of the true kraken antagonists even in high-level campaigns. **-Night Hag**. This goes without saying really. Hags are overall excellent antagonists, being creepy, cunning, and highly versatile. Night hags in particular are good for those fiend-centric campaigns, or recurring encounters with her in her ethereal soul stealing form. Their special items, the Soul Bag and Heartstone, are themselves interesting enough to be macguffins to drive your plot. For example, maybe you need a hag's heartstone in order to cure a very sick npc. **-Red Slaad**. Not exactly a mastermind, but boy can they multiply quickly. Just one Red Slaad is cause for panic, and will have the local authorities mustering every stray adventurer and sellsword to track it down and kill it, while the city's ratcatcher's are working overtime to hunt down any tadpoles that hatch. A slaad doesn't stay a CR 5 threat for long, so your party had better get to work fast. **-Revenant**. Driven only by revenge, there's so many ways in which you could use this unkillable walking corpse. They know exactly where their target is, can't permanently die, and are pretty tricky to kill in the first place. Your PCs better hope the revenant isn't after one of them. **-Sahuagin Baron**. Well it's in his name, isn't it? He's the top dog of his sahuagin crew, however big you want that crew to be, from a raiding party to a whole city. Soldiers, priestesses, and sharks come with the package, just having one of these guys in your game halfway builds a handful of encounters for you. **-Tanarukk**. One of these can easily be in charge of a whole clan or orcs, and said clan will be all the more dangerous for it. Makes for a great final boss to your orc adventure, and the bundle of orc variants that come with it is enough to flesh out a dungeon or a small campaign just through the premise of having a Tanarukk involved. And as long as you're going for the Tanarukk, what about throwing in some more smaller demons while you're at it? **-Unicorn**. You'd have to be running a very, very evil campaign for an unicorn to be your main antagonist, but if you are going that route then there's all sorts of potential for adventure you could have while invading a forest under an Unicorn's protection. **-Wood Woad**. A big chunky tree that makes for a good dungeon boss with a nice druidic or fey flavour. Wood Woads can sometimes choose their own purpose, whether that be noble or wicked. **-Wraith**. As an undead that can create other undead, you can think of a wraith as an incorporeal lite lich. Or close enough. For low levels they're just fine as undead masters, with the possibility of introducing their even more powerful boss later on, but there's nothing wrong with them being self-serving standalone antagonists either. **-Yuan-Ti**. There's no shortage of variants of these things in the CR range or below to fuel your adventures. *** **CR 4** *** Starting to get less versatile than CR 5 creatures, the weaker you go the harder it is for a creature to exert authority over other creatures, which in turn makes them less likely to be BBEGs. **-Barghest**. The unique thing about the Barghest is that it's the one threat that a goblin army can't really deal with itself. It's not just strong and sneaky, but it's pretty clever too. And most importantly, no goblin is brave enough to even try and fight one, as the permanent destruction of its soul is too great a threat. A goblin tribe might be forced to get some adventurers involved in order to deal with the threat, while the Barghest hides in plain sight, assassinates the tribe's leaders, and even controls the minds of other goblins to slow the players down or divert suspicion. What a way to turn Boblin the Goblin into an insidious threat. **-Bone Naga**. There's nothing to say a Bone Naga can't have its own agenda if its creators aren't around to control it. And there's nothing to say it might not hold a grudge for what's been done to it. As is, a Bone Naga still has very good average mental stats, so is perfectly capable of working around its weaknesses and limitations, at least in comparison to its former power. **-Coatl**. Even good players can find themselves conflicting with a perfectly lawful Coatl, or maybe you're just running an evil campaign. These things can shapeshift, read minds, scry from afar, influence dreams, all great abilities. But it also has hard counters to all of those same tactics being used against it, making it a devious foe to track down and kill. Not to mention that it can use its divine magic to keep any minions it has alive through almost any punishment the players can dish out short of a lethal blow. And this is all before considering that it could use its divine authority to recruit pious warriors and even paladins to its cause. **-Deathlock**. Undead warlocks who need to serve their patron's will in order to make up for failing in life. There's all kinds of warlock, and all kinds of scheme you could come up with. **-Ghost**. Did your previous BBEG die? Well maybe not quite. **-Incubus/Succubus**. The thing about these creatures is that they have a charm ability, but aren't likely to actually use it on their target, which makes it especially difficult to even figure out that you're up against one. In fact, the whole deal with a Succubus or Incubus is that they try and get other people to become villains. Of course, there's nothing wrong with charming people around their intended target into abandoning them, bullying them, or otherwise attempting to mentally break them. **-Lamia**. Perfect for those desert adventures, they can make for some very interesting and pretty dungeons, and are good for situations like forcing the players to fight in a gladiatorial arena. **-Neogi Master**. These interdimensional slavers, and their two weaker variants (hatchlings and adults) make for excellent foes who can wield a wide variety of underlings thanks to their propensity to mind control, and also have strange allies as customers for their trade. **-Orc Chief**. Pretty simple, but by no means ineffective. There's all sorts of stories you could fuel with an orc warband. *** **CR 3** *** We're starting to get to creatures with some pretty heavy drawbacks now. Level 3 is when everybody finally has their subclass abilities, casters get 2nd level spells, and so on, so this is usually where the variety of challenges a player can face starts to ramp up. **-Bugbear Chief**. Alright, so it's not as glamorous as the Orc Chief, but it's still perfectly functional as the head honcho of a goblin themed threat. Goblins and Bugbears lend themselves well to ambushes, so a villain like this would act more like an insurgent than a raiding party. **-Derro Savant**. If you want to run an adventure themed around madness and paranoia, then you could do worse than to get the Derro involved. Derro aren't very strong, the Savant being CR 3 and regular Derro being CR 1/4, but they they're quite inventive despite being quite irrational, so they could bolster their ranks with captives and slaves from other, stranger races at the nonsensical behest of their Savant leader. **-Doppelganger**. A couple of creatures thus far have had the ability to impersonate other people or read minds. Well, if that's what you're after, then the OG doppelganger is as good as anything, with no strings attached. **-Green Hag**. Hags make for excellent villains, even against parties well above their level. Green Hags in particular are great illusionists, but don't hold back on customising your hag with strange unique magical abilities. A hag's lair is also an great place to send your players, being weird, confusing, creepy, and dangerous. **-Hobgoblin Captain**. If you want your goblin horde to have a more militaristic bent, then having a Hobgoblin at the head is the way to go. This holds true for the regular hobgoblin too, just adjusted for lower level characters. **-Merrenoloth**. The especially unique thing about this yugoloth is that it's a CR 3 creature that has lair actions. And its lair is any ship it captains. This invites stories of pirate crews who have made deals with fiends, or maybe a raid on a slave ship captained by one of these things, or maybe a bargain made by desperate shipwreck survivors. Either way, if you really want your players to have trouble sinking a ship, or want a vessel crewed by strange creatures, this is the way to go. **-Mummy**. Don't just limit yourself to ancient egyptian mummies. There's mummies of various faiths such as christianity and buddhism, with buddhist mummification being self-inflicted. Oof. You just know you that can make for a good backstory for your villain. Of course, accidental mummies such as bog mummies exist too. And that rotting fist? Very cruel. If a mummy is going to be your BBEG though, maybe think about bumping that intelligence score up a bit. **-Spectator**. The second weakest of all beholder-kin, while it is a far cry from the power of a true Beholder but still a tough enemy for low level players and smart enough to have its own agenda. With the possibility that it has access to magical knowledge belonging to its summoner, consider giving your Spectator some summons of its own. **-Sword Wraith Warrior**. The entry for this undead seems to treat it as more of an environmental hazard of wandering old battlefields, but a creature can and should have an agenda. Get creative. What if this spirit manages to rally living creatures with its old tales of glory and incite them to violence? To what ends might a Sword Wraith go to achieve its stolen honour? **-Wight**. Undead that can create more undead are always a ticking time bomb. They make for fine lieutenants to stringer undead like liches but are also a threat just by themselves. And with the troops of zombies they can amass, they can challenge higher level players too. *** **CR 2** *** At this level, players are quite squishy and don't have many resources to expend, as such the creatures on their level are working with significant limitations. But there's nothing to say a creature of this challenge rating couldn't face off against much tougher players, if they were smart about it. **-Berbalang**. Sages living on the astral plane that covet secrets, and glean those secrets mostly by interrogating the bones of the dead. Their base abilities and stats are enough to make them good schemers, and their ability to fight remotely with their spectral duplicate can make them annoyingly evasive, but for a beefier berbalang you could lean into their planar travel or necromantic abilities to turn them into decent conjurers. **-Ghast**. Not particularly devious, its mediocre mental stats are still enough for it to invent and optimise plans to a degree, with long-term goals in mind. With some imagination, you could create a ghast villain with a horde of ghouls at their command looking to exploit some natural disaster or large scale conflict in order to satiate their hunger. **-Myconid Sovereign**. The Sovereign itself isn't terribly powerful, but it has a wicked ability in its Animating Spores. Once that comes into play, the CR of any number of myconids hardly matters. A party of level 10 adventurers might feel no peril at all storming a myconid's underdark home, right up until they're knee deep in Purple Fungus and are facing down a pair of Fomorian Spore Servants. **-Sea Hag**. Like with other hags, the cunning and manipulations of a hag matter more than anything on their stat block, and even the sea hag can make for an interesting roleplay encounter. After all, there's more to a BBEG than just being a final boss fight. The Sea Hag also gives you a great reason to break out a bunch of other aquatic creatures. That Horrific Appearance ability is also something that can scramble the battle plans of any party. *** CR 1 *** To be honest, you're never going to fight the actual BBEG of your campaign at level 1. So the creatures here either have to work as genuine villains for a 1st level party, or more likely have some quality which can let them antagonise stronger characters. **-Dryad**. Dryads, like many fey, can be tricky creatures. And they can use that cunning for evil. People getting lost in the woods is a decent story hook for a beginning adventure, while the amount of fey, beasts, or humanoids that the dryad can charm leaves room to challenge higher level parties, opens up interesting roleplay, or otherwise just expands her scope as an antagonist. **-Firenewt Warlock of Imix**. With backup from Giant Striders and Firenewt Warriors, the structure of a Firenewt Warlock's forces start to take shape. While not the most impressive or complex villain by itself, a bit of creativity could expand the capabilities of these creatures or just take advantage of a straightforward premise. **-Goblin Boss**. It's a classic DnD starter villain, but there's no reason you can't add some flavour and unique character and have this guy terrorise higher level players, especially when paired up with other creatures like ogres and bugbears for some much needed muscle. The innate character that comes from its Redirect Attack feature is enough by itself to start crafting a memorable villain to start off your campaign. **-Imp**. If you've got the king's ear, you have the power of a king. This invisible devil can sit and whisper temptations to its allies as it tries to seduce them to evil, and use its animal forms to stalk and spy on the players. Don't underestimate the ability of this creature to bring down a kingdom, and orchestrate the downfall of parties that could kill it as easily as look at it. **-Kobold Scale Sorcerer**. Kobolds are kind if infamous for their ability to terrorise much stronger beings than them, but if you need a mastermind for your devious warren of minions, then the Scale Sorcerer and it's naturally higher charisma makes for a good leader. *** CR 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8. *** Yup, we're doing this. These creatures by all rights shouldn't be able to challenge the weakest of DnD parties, but here they are trying to anyway. Or at least, that was my intention. As is, I can't actually find anything that I can write about in confidence. Creatures in this CR range are almost by design not meant to be main villains. For sure, a single bandit, xvart, pixie, noble, goblin, or whatever other creature you like could be a main villain, even with the normal stats given to them, in the right campaign with the right dm with the right party it could work really well. But there's not much I can say about one that doesn't apply to most of them, if not most of the creatures I've already listed. So there's stuff in here that works, just not well enough that I want to write about it twenty times. *** That's all I've got. Like I said, this isn't a comprehensive list otherwise I might as well just type out the entire monster manual, but I do for one reason or another, for the most part, think these work well or otherwise stand out."
93,vulnerability,DnD,Curse of Strahd from start to finish (Part 2),1,dweiln,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dweiln/curse_of_strahd_from_start_to_finish_part_2/,2019-11-15 06:32:15,"([Part 1](URL The barbarian turned and punched the paladin in the face, and my rogue was about to stab him in the neck, but the cleric stepped in between us. ""You can't kill him!"" she said. ""We need him if we have any chance of saving this townor killing Strahd."" My rogue was shaking with anger, but she nodded curtly. ""Fine,"" she spat. ""But as soon as Strahd's dead? I'm killing him myself."" We chopped up the wooden pews to make stakes and went out vampire hunting and managed to kill the spawn with minimal deaths, and moved on to continue our quest to gather all the things we'd need to kill Strahd. This is where things started getting a little... dicy. See, killing Ireena had caused the paladin to fallhe was now just a regular fighter. And the Dark Powers noticed this sudden vulnerability in our group and began whispering to us in our dreams. These weren't the Dark Powers from the module; the DM had juiced them up to make them much more dangerous, but also much more appealing to strike bargains with. The paladin's body slowly began turning to ice as he gave more and more of himself over to the one whispering to him; my own rogue's hair and eyes turned orange and she radiated heat the more she bargained with the entity calling itself the Morning Lord. It was around then that Strahd 'invited' us to Ravenloft for dinner; the barbarian refused the invitation, so we split the party (and the barbarian was subsequently killed by wolves before Strahd took his body and fused it to Piddlewick in a freaky Frankenstein's monster type experiment, but that happened later so I won't focus on it too much). My rogue, the cleric, and the paladin arrived at Ravenloft... and were greeted by Ireena. It turned out the paladin hadn't quite killed her; she had just enough life in her for Strahd to turn her into a vampire. And oh *boy* she was pissed off. She wanted to kill the people who had betrayed her, but Strahd insisted she be polite to his guests. Of course, he told us as we were leaving that we had one week, and then he'd be sending out his minions to kill us. One week to get to the Amber Temple. On the way there, we paid a visit to Argynvostholt, where the fallen paladin got to meet his old comrades as revenants. They told us that the skull of Argynvost was in Baba Lysaga's possession, so off we detoured to get that; it turned out ol' Baba was keeping an Archfey imprisoned in her chicken hut, so after we killed her and rescued the Archfey, she kindly teleported the skull back to the cathedral for us. Things went screwy again outside the Amber Temple. After a long and arduous journey, we reached the mountain only to find Ireena waiting outside, ready to kill us. My rogue told the others to stay back as she approached alone; she and Ireena had been close before Vallaki, so she thought she would have the best chance to talk her down. No dice; Ireena was dead set on killing us. My rogue kissed her before stabbing her in the stomach with the Sunblade; Ireena turned herself to mist and escaped back to Ravenloft. We headed into the temple and immediately got our asses kicked by the fireball-spitting guardian at the entrance. We fell back, regrouped, and tried to make a plan for getting inside. Something you should know about me as a player: I'm impulsive. I love telling a good story, yeah, but at the same time, if you mark a big red button with a sign saying ""DO NOT PUSH"", I'm gonna punch that thing so hard it would see stars. So, you hand me an easy-access bargaining chip (my soul) in exchange for *something* cool happening, I'm gonna take that deal, just to see what would happen. While the others debated strategy, my rogue closed her eyes and contacted the Morning Lordor whatever was calling itself that, anyway. Here's where I really slipped up. My rogue didn't trust this thing one bit, so the more of her soul she bargained away, she always included the stipulation that if anyone was going to get hurt from her bargains, it would only be her. I, and therefore she, forgot to add this stipulation. My rogue burst into flames and turned into a freakin *phoenix*, lunged at the cleric, and dropped her from full HP to zero in one hit. It turns out the Morning Lord had been whispering to the cleric, the cleric rejected its advances, and now this thing wanted revenge. Mind, nobody thought they could beat phoenix-me, so the fallen paladin called on his Dark Power and turned into this... ice giant *thing*, and we started going at it like something out of Dragonball Z. The warlock grabbed the fallen cleric and hauled her out of the way so he could pour a healing potion down her throat while we fought. Here, the DM had me roll a Wisdom save, and my rogue managed to regain enough control to transform back, lying on the ground and screaming, holding her head. The Morning Lord pulled her consciousness out of her body and she found herself standing on an endless plane of fire, burning and burning and burning, dying over and over during the course of *weeks* while the Morning Lord ordered her to kill the cleric. My rogue kept insisting she'd do it after Strahd was dead (fully intending to double-cross the Morning Lord), but that was no good. I was going to be tortured until I broke. Through the pain and screaming, the ex-paladin's voice broke through. ""Come on, stay with us! You didn't make it this far to go out like this!"" My rogue mustered up the last of her strength and lifted her head. ""Go fuck yourself,"" she snarled, and her consciousness slammed back into her body. She was lying in the snow outside the temple, and barely ten minutes had passed for her friends. It turned out that the Dark Powers only held as much power over you as you allowed; telling them no left them, wellpowerless. Problem now: the ex-paladin and my rogue were left with some nasty debilitating side effects that would not be doing us any favors making our way through the temple."
94,vulnerability,DnD,"RP and describe mutagens, order of the mutant bloodhunter",1,dx5odz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dx5odz/rp_and_describe_mutagens_order_of_the_mutant/,2019-11-16 22:17:58,"So I'm soon choosing my first mutagens and was thinking about how I'm gonna roleplay them. Some seem pretty clear, like aether (flying speed) could be some wings growing (depending on your character insect wings, or bird wings or whatever. Potency I can also imagine, how some mutations let the character get bulky and the muscles grow. But for example celerity or mobility is harder for me to think how I could describe it. Also any additional rp ideas for mutant are welcome. My idea is, that my character gets his mutations through mushrooms, so I take some inspiration from last of us for mutations. Aether Prerequisite: 11th level You gain a flying speed of 20 feet. Side effect: You have disadvantage on all Strength and Dexterity ability checks. Celerity Your Dexterity score increases by an amount equal to your mutation score, as does your Dexterity maximum. Side effect: Your Wisdom score decreases by amount equal to your mutation score.

I get bored of my characters and we didn't have a regular DM so I decided to give it a shot! My world/universe is a fairly simple concept, which allows for fairly complex plots. I'll explain the world and give a brief history. Think it's kind of cool since it allows for unlimited creativity within a reasonable spectrum, which I love since I hate being limited (had a very limiting DM before). Any additonal ideas/possible quests/whatever is appreciated! Magic is called the Arcane in my world/s. It is alive, unpredictable, and always in flux. At first there was nothing... a vast space void of matter, and this is where the Arcane delved until it split into a spectrum of different Arcane. Each individual spectrum gave birth to an intellectual, instinctive being which had control over its part of the spectrum (the Gods). The Gods in turn created their own Planes which are governed by the Gods Arcanic properties (fire/water/earth/necrotic/radiant, etc.). These allowed for life forms which the Gods created through the Arcane and which adapted to their specific environments. Some planes are more advanced than others through better utilisation of their Arcanic environments (have a steam punk plane hidden somewhere). Gods eventually came together and merged their powers to create a world in which relied in the balance of their powers (some are more powerful than others, so it's more of a ratio than anything else that must be maintained). This world is called Dystophia. Long story short: planes and Dystophia which is the centre is connected through Nether Portals which are controlled by Nether Beasts. Destroying a Portal/Beast upsets balance, which impacts Dystophia since Arcanic energy must come from other places to restore those to reset balance. Here you have a world in which you can create any character, justify any flavour, already have a means to create drama (imbalance in Dystophia), there is now also two superpowers which are present in Dystophia (cold war sorta thing) (want players to decide what to do with this), oh! There are corrupt wizards/sorcerers who have delved too deep into the Arcane and are now called the Nav'i, which seek to kill the Beasts/Portals so create chaos. To top it off... remember when I said the Arcane was in flux? Yeah when there is a build up of Arcane in an area, it merges with its environment and creates a monster (has vulnerability/resistance according to what it merged with), which helps with keeping my players on their toes! Im a sandbox dm, they do whatever, I go with it. I have bullet points and key npc's to interact with, but ultimately if they decide to stay in a town for all eternity then I adapt the campaign around that (probs get the two superpowers involved/fluxes). What do you think? Any tips? Inspiration? Possible planes? Any tools I can use? Go crazy!! :D"
97,vulnerability,DnD,Class that is not a Class: Balanced Lycanthrope,10,dg6jby,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dg6jby/class_that_is_not_a_class_balanced_lycanthrope/,2019-10-11 10:36:50,"TLDR: I made a more balanced lycanthrope PC ""class"" using entirely RAW mechanics PC Lycanthropes have always been something difficult to balance. Even if someone hasn't played D&amp;D they likely know what a werewolf is, and in the first game I ever DM'ed and my third ever campaign, it was easy for me to curse the lvl 2 rogue with Lycanthropy after he stole an artifact from the Sun church of Helm. I didn't know what kind of pandora's box I opened using the heavily unbalanced DMG lycanthrope rules where all curse negatives are DM-controlled. It's brokeness is emphasized at low levels (mainly due to the immunities) and unless you have a DM that is devoted to tracking lunar cycles and making your curse detrimental, it is all gain. In the 5 years since that game, I've seen a handful of bad lycanthrope homebrews and decided to do something about it. Yes, Blood Hunter Order of the Lycan exists now, and finally we have something that looks good, but I wanted to challenge myself to use nothing homebrew and use only RAW. Lastly, one thing that gets me about D&amp;D is that people always identify as their class. PC's often introduce themselves as ""a rouge"" or ""a fighter"", when realistically, people wouldn't introduce themselves like that. So that is why this is a class that isn't a class. You aren't ""a class"", but more of an individual that just exists within the universe that is cursed with lycanthropy. So, what are general characteristics of a lycanthrope? * **Cursed** * **Shape changing into a beast form or hybrid form** * **natural weapons** * **Multiattack** * **immunity to B, P, &amp; S** from non-magical weapons that aren't silvered * **Keen smell** **Skeleton of the build up to Lvl 11** * **Backstory**\- It would be helpful to put your **curse** here, or at the onset of level 2 * **First 2** levels Moon druid * This gets you **wild shape** up to CR 1- giving you **natural weapons** * Spell slot dumping in WS to heal * Druid spells- take thematic ones: guidance (to boost perception uses/**keen hearing and smell**), Primal savagery (**natural weapons**), infestation, longstrider, jump, speak with animals, animal friendship, locate animal or plant, etc. that you can flavor as not really casting them. It makes sense that a werewolf can run fast, jump high or speak with animals. * **Level 3**\- Barbarian 1 * Sets you up with rage, which will give you **resistance to B, P, and S** * Gives you Unarmored defense which will boost certain wild shapes * **Levels 4-7**\- Barbarian 2-5 Bear Totem * Extra attack/**multiattack** * **Further resistances** when raging * Speed increase +10 * More thematic spells: beast sense and speak with animals * **Levels 8-11**\- Druid 3-6 * Gives you more spells to heal and remain in WS longer (because with this build, your bonus action is often free * Remain in WS longer due to higher druid level * Lvl 5 druids can get conjure animals, which would work great with a werewolf summoning a pack of 8 wolfs. * Lvl 6 give magic wild shape attacks * Lvl 6 opens up Sabre tooth tiger (CR2) for weretigers and Giant Boar for wereboars **Add-ons** * **Progressive curse** * This works best with *werewolves* and *weretigers* * Basically, the more your level up, the stronger your curse/changes get, so you don't go right out the gate and use your max CR * Werewolves: Level 2: jackal &amp; hyena, Level 3: mastiff and wolf, Level 4: Dire wolf and Giant Hyena * Weretiger: Level 2: cat, Level 3: panther, Level 4: Lion &amp; Tiger, Druid level 6: Saber-toothed tiger * You can't WS at lvl 1, but if there are new people to the party, you probably wouldn't broadcast your curse, which in my mind takes care of that * **Feats** * Charger: Yes, I know that it isn't most people's favorite and once you get extra attack at Barb 5, it isn't as useful here, but it works well before then and it has nice synergy with the weretiger shapes that have pounce and wereboar shapes with charge * Martial adept: adds some combat flavor. Menacing attack especially * **Hidden/visible curse (Opinion)** * If the party **doesn't know** you are a lycanthrope, once you hit level 3, prioritize leveling up **barbarian**. This will increase your damage output and tankiness once you are able to be a bit more open about your curse * If the party **does know** you are a lycanthrope, once you hit level 3, prioritize leveling up **druid**. This will get you more spell slots to heal and extend your WS longer, get you magic natural weapons and open up better WS for weretigers and wereboars **Cons:** I anticipate this build being weaker than other characters at higher levels because it is all based around CR 1 and 2 monsters at max. It further becomes an issue because you don't get magic resistance overcoming attacks until level 7 or 11. It requires dedication going in, acknowledging your path and ultimate goal. You can't easily whip this out on another PC and have them instantly become a full lycanthrope, since it takes level investment. **Pros:** Because you manage your changes with wild shape, it reduces the need for the DM to manage lunar calendars, since the DMG doesn't specify exactly how/when shapechanging occurs for PCs. You still need to work with your DM about how to add interesting story elements with it, but I feel that by offloading the burden of the DM of keeping track of calendars or another means of regulation, it frees up time/energy to work with your DM about interesting roleplay/curse-related situations. I tried to balance immediate immunity to damage types upon changing with a building resistance during raging that progresses with level. The only homebrew aspect that I recommend giving this is silvered weapons overcome resistances (or are a vulnerability), but one would not need to do this. Feel free to use and incorporate as you like, comment and critique, or even provide suggestions, as I'm currently playing through it at level 2 where the party doesn't know yet!"

The consequence for him using it is he has to roll a 1d100 and every time he uses it the chances of his soul getting condemned gets higher by 5% per use. If he eventually fails his soul will be condemned keeps the flaws and but loses the gift and has to go barter or fight for his soul with deity he made a deal with. this idea is from Lunchbreakheroes btw do recommend checking that channel out. Current Issue: The player was asking me how does this spell work against PCs and I told him I will get back to that. I am a little skeptical to even allow this for him to PVP the PCs this way. I'm not too worried about him using this against NPCs cause it wont work against a couple and etc. I am worried about him using this against the PCs, I am for PVP in my campaigns as long as the roleplay and lead up to it is organic and justified. So should I just straight not allow him to use this against PCs? Or is there a system you guys would recommend to handle this? or do you think the system I have in place for him is good enough for punishment? because he will have a 1/20 chance of not being able to use it anymore after"

Just to be a decent, I allowed a player to make a Treefolk. What that means is I let him make a warforged, gave it fire vulnerability and the subtype Plant. So anything that effects plants, such as *Blight* would effect him as it would a plant. Now, onto the spell. It says it creates a link between an inanimate plant and *another* plant on the same plane of existence. It doesn't specify inanimate. Would that mean that if he used Transport Via Plants on himself, the party could teleport to the other plant (leaving him behind of course)?"

Galmiera worked on research for many of the great cities defences nearly 80% of the cities defences where thanks to his genius designs. Sentinal golems with more brain power that a normal golem roamed the streets up holding the law, along with mechanical steeds to hall supplies around the city. Yes everything that Galmiera created was praised by the council and the people, until, one of his researches crossed the line of marality. Galmiera had takin hold of a city prisoner with out concent from council, his research altered the mans body in an extremely radical way. Using a mixture of different echantments and ritual spells, the mans body was twisted, and stretched, resulting a painful and gruesome death. The corpses limbs had grown to abnormal lengths, tearing the flesh around the joints, and causing the eyes to fall out of their sockets. He had been attempting to create a new soldier who would have hightend senses, and could bend steel as if it were a fresh twig. When Galmiera was discovered by the council they where shock and discusted by his failed creations form. So much so, he was stripped of all of his research material, and was thrown into forced labor for 5 years. During this time Galmiera had thought up an escape plan, using some familiar chemicals, he was able to fake his death. A few of the researchers that had worked under Galmiera still respected him and new of his plan to escape, and had arranged to meet with him. Adiment on completing his research, him and his followers started working below the city. Many failed expirements arose, many where kept in cages with a shock enchantment on the bars to keep them from trying to escape. Then one day his greatest creation yet, was also his last. This one was known as ZARIQUE, he was everything Galmiera had dreamed he would be and more, with strength greater than any man, orc, or even an ogre, could hope to achieve. This one creature had the combine stength of 500 men. Within a day and half the Zarique had laid waste to the city of Kuatira.

102,vulnerability,DnD,Jackalweres and more: Looking for feedback on some homebrew 5e player races,1,dpt0ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dpt0ua/jackalweres_and_more_looking_for_feedback_on_some/,2019-11-01 07:01:07,"Hi all, new to this subreddit (and reddit in general)! I recently made some player race versions of a few monsters and was hoping to get some feedback on them, namely if they're over/underpowered. They're currently somewhat bare-bones in terms of flavor, but I figure I'll flesh that out once I get their mechanics settled. So, without further ado: **Jackalwere** Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. Age: Jackalweres mature at a rate similar to humans, though live a few years shorter. Alignment: Though many believe Jackalweres to be inherent malicious tricksters, and indeed some fall into this role, Jackalweres are ultimately capable of choosing their own path in life. Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Adept Deceiver: You have proficiency in the Deception skill. Silver Vulnerability: You have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from silvered weapons. Sleep Gaze: As an action, you gaze at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC for the saving throw equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 10 minutes or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. A creature that successfully saves against the effect is immune to your gaze for the next 24 hours. Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren't affected by it. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Abyssal. Shapechanger: You can use your action to polymorph into a specific Medium human or a jackal-humanoid hybrid, or back into your true form (that of a Small jackal). Your statistics, unless otherwise noted, are the same in each form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isn't transformed. You revert to your true form if you die. You gain the following abilities while in each form: *Hybrid:* Hybrid Form: Your base walking speed is 35 feet. You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. Bite: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Keen Hearing and Smell: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. *Jackal:* True Form: Your size is Small. Your base walking speed is 40 feet. Your base AC is 13 + your Dexterity modifier. You gain no benefit from wearing armor. You can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any equipment that requires hands. You cannot perform the somatic components of spells. Bite: Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Keen Hearing and Smell: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Pack Tactics: You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated. \--- **Chuul** Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age: Chuuls grow slowly, reaching physical maturity around the age of 40. Designed for longevity, they can live indefinitely. Alignment: Having been created by the aboleths as dutiful servants, chuuls tend towards lawful evil. However, chuuls that have broken free of their ingrained directives can forge their own path in life. Size: Chuuls stand around 6 feet at shoulder height. Their shells and six-legged anatomy make them heavy for their size, averaging 500 pounds. Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 ft. Your base swim speed is 20 ft. Amphibious: You can breathe air and water. Awakened Mind: Your creature type is humanoid instead of aberration. Darkvision: You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Magic Sense: You can cast the Detect Magic spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so after you finish a short or long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. Natural Armor: Due to your shell and six-limbed body, you are ill-suited to wearing armor. However, your chitinous carapace provides ample protection; it gives you a base AC of 16 (your Dexterity modifier doesn't affect this number). You gain no benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you can apply the shield's bonus as normal. Pincers: Your pincers are natural weapons designed for grasping prey. You have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks when attempting to grapple a target. Tentacles: Your tentacles secrete a natural venom. As a bonus action, you can force a creature you are grappling to make a Constitution saving throw.The DC for this saving throw is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw on the end of each of its turns. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is no longer poisoned and becomes immune to the venom for the next 24 hours. After you use your tentacles, you can't use them again until you finish a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech. \--- **Nothic** Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity, Intelligence, and Wisdom scores increase by 1. Age: Alignment: Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Vestige of Humanity: Your creature type is humanoid (nothic) instead of aberration. Keen Sight: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. All-Seeing Eye: As an action, you gain truesight out to a range of 10 feet until the end of your next turn. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Rotting Gaze: As an action, you gaze balefully at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 necrotic damage. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. For the next minute, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns or take an additional 1d6 damage. This effect ends on a successful save. The damage increases to 2d6 at 6th level, 3d6 at 11th level, and 4d6 at 16th level. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Weird Insight: As an action, you stare at one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must contest its Charisma (Deception) check against your Wisdom (Insight) check. If you win, you magically learn one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being charmed. You can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a short or long rest. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon. \--- **Quaggoth** Ability Score Increase: Your Constitution score increases by 2. Age: Alignment: Size: Your size is Medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Your base climbing speed is 30 feet. Darkvision: You have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. Claw: Your sharp claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike. Poison Resistance: You have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws to resist poison. Wounded Fury: While you have half of your hit points or fewer, you have advantage on attack rolls. In addition, while you have one quarter of your hit points or fewer, you deal an extra 1d4 damage whenever you hit a target with a melee attack. The damage increases to 2d4 at 6th level, 3d4 at 11th level, and 4d4 at 16th level. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon. Subspecies: *Hunter* Ability Score Increase: Your Strength score increases by 1. Superior Darkvision: Your darkvision has a radius of 120 feet. Quick Recovery: Whenever you roll a one on a hit die, you may reroll that die. You must use the new roll. Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of our attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. *Thonot* Ability Score Increase: Your Wisdom score increases by 1. Sunlight Sensitivity: You have disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of our attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. Thonot Psionics: You know the *mage hand* cantrip (the hand is invisible). When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *feather fall* spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the *cure wounds* spell as a 2nd-level spell once per day. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells. *Arboreal* Ability Score Increase: Your Dexterity score increases by 1.

106,vulnerability,DnD,Metagaming a Beholder; how do you kill one?,7,dr8g9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dr8g9m/metagaming_a_beholder_how_do_you_kill_one/,2019-11-04 10:10:42,"Beholders are designed to be partykillers. An answer for wild hubris. Considering their ability to manifest their thoughts as tangible reality, while simultaneously considering that those thoughts are obsessive, paranoid, and solely concerned with self-preservation and the destruction of unwelcome visitors to their lair, combined with an alien intelligence far surpassing most mortals and centuries of preparation, it seems to me a proper Beholder encounter should be tailored to the party and hint at a prescience that is effectively metagaming. This has the downside of creating a nearly unkillable creature. Beholders do have flaws, but these flaws dont seem to be relevant to an intrusive, hostile group of adventurerers. Flattery seems ineffective, despite their vanity, because they would have considered that vulnerability and would be alert to it. How do you play these things? I'd really like to, they're iconic and tempting but they seem OP."
107,vulnerability,DnD,Perhaps the greatest case of a DM shooting himself in the foot,12,dredfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dredfn/perhaps_the_greatest_case_of_a_dm_shooting/,2019-11-04 18:38:20,"Currently I am running a homebrew campaign for four new players. All of them are awesome, love their characters and are slowly warming up to the idea of roleplaying. We have a few silly shenanigans, but otherwise everyone is pretty interested in keeping a somewhat serious game. Last session the players went to a village to find out what had been causing a number of murders in town. After a bit of digging, and a very very lucky detect magic, they discovered that the resident sweet old lady, was actually a green hag in disguise. As it happened, her pet dogs were actually Death Dogs in disguise. Roll initiative and the battle begins. The Bard is taken down by 2 very lucky attacks from the hag, and ""luckily"" the players are able to avoid her dogs somewhat, as they begin to go after civilians. Now in town there was a cleric, a Nature Cleric named Brother Leslin of the Lady Nevehen. Brother Leslin is the reason why I will never be using the spell guiding bolt again. So the first death dog is taken down, and the Hag has since then blown a dog whistle to attract her final pup. Now this was the BIG boss of this part. The first real big boss my players were supposed to face. A hybrid bred from direwolf, shadow mastiff and death dog. A massive canine with black muddy fur, and a head that seems to split partway in two, leaving it with 3 eyes and a two way open mouth. Little Oster as he was called. He was a monster I'd been hinting at for weeks. Building him up and up. Leaving little messages in our discord server like, ""Oh you'll probably level up, if you don't die."" Everyone was at once hyped, and scared to bits when he came charging into the village. Little Oster managed to arrive, and then take 112 damage from a level 2 spell, and promptly ran away. How? Now here's where I need to step back and explain something. I don't generally use a monster from the monster manual without modifying it somehow. Either changing some damage dice, giving it an hp boost or additional attacks. Just keep this in mind. I feel the monster manual doesn't do enough to make each monster unique. So for the shadow mastiff, I decided to give it a weakness to radiant damage, and by proxy, to Little Oster. It makes sense in principle, and gives the players a weakness to exploit. The team monk was a Sun Soul, and the team barbarian was a Zealot, so it's not like they didn't have any of that type even at low level. So on Brother Leslin's turn, having seen his people die, and seeing this massive monster approach, he runs up before it, and pulling off his best Gandalf impression, yells for the rest of the party to kill the Hag, then raises his hand to cast guiding bolt. I figured if he hit, it would take a good chunk, but Little Oster had enough damage to decimate him next round, so it would be okay. Issue was, He rolls a nat20. I figure alright, 10d6, average 35. However I had forgotten that I gave the beast vulnerability until I went to check its HP total. So double that damage and you got 70. Impressive, but the dog would still be up. On 10d6 dice, he manages to roll 56. Dealing 112 Damage. The entire table is at once bursting into laughter and amazement, declaring stuff like, ""He's coming with us, there's noway we're leaving him here"" After that, Oster ran away only to get sniped from 100ft by the Warlock, giving her The How do you Want to do this. The hag initially escaped, but the kobold managed to pull a Santa Clause with his wings, and sneak through her chimney, at which point he decapitated the old wench. I have had many cases where I forgot something during combat that would probably have been important, but this is by far the most extreme case of this. Tl;DR: I forgot I gave a monster an exploitable weakness, and accidentally had an NPC all but kill the Big Boss monster in 1 turn."
108,vulnerability,DnD,Feedback on homebrew mechanic - Divine rune enchants,2,d0ta7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/d0ta7c/feedback_on_homebrew_mechanic_divine_rune_enchants/,2019-09-07 17:57:58,"I've talked to my playgroup (who likes a good mix of RP style and also more video game style combat sessions with playmats) about changing up magic item rewards. Rather than handing them a list of magic items, or giving them one I think they'll like, I'm retrofitting ESO's rune smithing system which will allow players to mix runes to create a unique effect. There is a max of one enchantment per player, and more and more interesting runes will become available in addition to treasure as the campaign progresses. Enchantments can be on anything they carry. Put simply, there are 3 groups of runes. Verb, Noun, and Trigger. &gt; Verb could include: - Nullify - Become - Control &gt; Noun could include: - Flame - Knowledge - Time &gt; Trigger is when the effect actually starts: - On killing a creature - When in peril - When under the night sky with the moon visible Players choose a rune from each category to build a custom effect that I hope to invent on the fly that is appropriate for their level. For example Control/Time/Peril runes grant Haste to the user when their health drops to single digits. Become/Flame/Killing might set the user alight for a duration after killing a creature... I'm sure I can make that a positive with thought. The main feedback I want is about the quest rewards for completing a major subplot, enchantments that morph a chosen weapon into a more powerful version built to fend off the waves of demons and aberrations in the endgame. Instead of Verb/Noun/Trigger there is just Effect/Trigger. There are 8 runes to allow one combination per player. I know they'll enjoy trying to work out the optimal combinations even if they're quite ""game-y"". I've posted them below and I'd like feedback on their balance. First are the Trigger runes. When the condition is met the weapon will glow with power, applying the effect (seen below triggers) to the next creature struck. - Reap &gt; Upon killing a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. Then if it your turn, you may move up to 5ft, and you may attack another creature adjacent to you. - Retribution &gt; Upon taking damage from an attack from a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. You do not fail *any* death saving throws from taking damage, though you still die if your health falls below your maximum limit. - Zeal &gt; Upon dealing damage with two consecutive attacks to the same demon, devil, undead, or aberration. This can be over multiple rounds. When a demon, devil, undead, or aberration dies within 60ft of you, gain health equal to it's CR. - Intervention &gt; Upon landing an attack of opportunity on a demon, devil, undead, or aberration. When hit, the creature's movement speed becomes 0 until the end of it's next turn. Next up are the Effect runes, applying it to the next creature struck. If the creature is damaged for 1 or more hitpoints, the empowerment ends. If the attack misses the empowerment does not end (lasting 5 minutes) - Judgement &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; On damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, attacks made against it have advantage and the creature has vulnerability to all damage types. This lasts until the end of your next turn. - Parity &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; Upon damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, it takes radiant damage equal to it's CR. Then you may redistribute the health lost in this way between any number of target creatures within line of sight. - Sanctuary &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; Upon damaging a demon, devil, undead, or aberration, the damaged creature cannot reduce the health of yourself, or an ally within 60ft of you, below 1HP on it's next turn. The creature gains disadvantage against all saving throws until the end of your next turn. - Flagellation &gt; Deals 2d6 additional radiant damage. &gt; When you damage a devil, demon, undead, or aberration it loses concentration and becomes vulnerable to radiant damage. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes damage from any sources of healing instead of regaining hit points. It can attempt to resist this effect with a Will save (10+spell level+prof.). Each player chooses one trigger and one effect. For example the fighter may choose Judgement/Reap whilst the cleric chooses Retribution/Parity. If the player doesnt use a conventional weapon (e.g. a caster) then there are a few rules about it applying from spell casts instead. Anything which deals damage as an attack should work. I want the effects to synergise but also stand on their own. The players should be around level 9 acquiring these weapons and around 11 by the final fight. I want them to be balanced, but to be special and irreplaceable as getting these is a major milestone to the story. Any feedback on the balance between them?"
109,vulnerability,DnD,how can i make this balanced so its not overpowered?,2,d1rqeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/d1rqeo/how_can_i_make_this_balanced_so_its_not/,2019-09-10 00:36:34,"Dark Necromancer Creating a Dark Necromancer &amp;#x200B; Suggestions to Create a Dark Necromancer A Dark Necromancer relies very heavily on both Wisdom and Intelligence as this controls both how powerful their abilities will be and how limited they will be in their functionality respectively, so making these two stats your highest would be wise. Secondly your Constitution is very valuable to you as you are not a very durable class and rely heavily on your spells and abilities for survival. &amp;#x200B; Class Features As a Dark Necromancer you gain the following class features. &amp;#x200B; Hit Points Hit Dice: 1d6 per Dark Necromancer level Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + Constitution modifier per Dark Necromancer level after 1st &amp;#x200B; Proficiencies Armor: Light Armor Weapons: Simple Weapons, Scythes Tools: None Saving Throws: Wisdom, Intelligence Skills: Choose two from: History, Insight, Persuasion, Religion, and Intimidation &amp;#x200B; Equipment You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: &amp;#x200B; (a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) any other simple weapon (a) a scholar's pack or (b) a dungeoneer's pack Leather armor and a dagger Table: The Dark Necromancer Level Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Master of Mortality 2nd +2 Otherworldly Weapon 3rd +2 Dark Power (1), Dark Book 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3  6th +3 Dark Power (2) 7th +3  8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4  10th +4 Dark Power (3) 11th +4  12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 Dark Power (4) 14th +5  15th +5  16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 Dark Power (5) 18th +6  19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 Master of Death Master of Mortality The Dark Necromancer may immediately choose to learn either the cantrip Spare the Dying or Toll the Dead. &amp;#x200B; Ability Score Increase When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. &amp;#x200B; Otherworldly Weapon The Necromancer learns a ritual to summon forth either a scythe or a dagger from the Realm of the Grim Reaper. This weapon can only be wielded by the Necromancer that summoned it. Summoning this scythe takes 2 hours, and hurts the Necromancer 1d12 hit points as they struggle to maintain mortality and master wielding a weapon from another dimension. This weapon deals 1d6 damage as necrotic, with a range of 5-ft and has no weight. Attack rolls and damage bonuses for this weapon are from the player's Wisdom mod instead of strength. So long as the Necromancer is in contact with the ground, they may simply reach into the ground and pull this weapon back to their hands as a bonus action no matter where the weapon was in the mortal plane. (At level 5 the damage of this weapon is increased to 2d4 and at level 12 the damage increases again to be 2d6) &amp;#x200B; Dark Power At each level that the Dark Necromancer gains a new Dark Power, they may select one based on the book they have chosen at level 3. &amp;#x200B; Dark Book The necromancer uses his immortal soul as the price to open a named book of great power, eternally binding himself to it. Once opened, the necromancer acquires special spells and abilities based on the book selected as long as the necromancer is in possession of this dark book. The necromancer knows at all times which direction this book is as they are soulbound to it but cannot use any class abilities or spells when it is not present on their person. The Dark Powers that the player may select from are different based on which book they have chosen to open. Once a book has been opened and chosen by the player, it cannot ever be undone. &amp;#x200B; Absolom, the Book of Bone Mestophales, The Book of Souls Terradirge, The Book of Flesh Master of Death The Dark Necromancer gains complete immunity to Necrotic damage and gains advantage on death saving throws. &amp;#x200B; Absolom, The Book of Bone Unlocking Absolom, The Book of Bone grants the Necromancer lost knowledge on the dark magic that binds all bones together, granting them the ability to manipulate and control bone through dark magics to forge undead servants. Unlocking this book immediately grants the Necromancer access to the following spells and abilities &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Ritual - Summon Skeleton Casting Time: 2 consecutive full rounds Range: 5-ft Components: V, M (fresh humanoid corpse) Duration: - Description: You have the ability to summon a number of humanoid skeletons to serve, protect, and do your bidding. Once the ritual has been completed, the corpse will begin to bind with dark energy, and 1 round after the ritual has been completed, your dark magic summon forth a skeleton that tears out of the corpse, standing over it. These skeletons have the profile defined below, and can follow very simple commands. You may have a total of half your Dark Necromancer level (rounded down) worth of HD to invest into controlling such skeletons, but may not control more skeletons at any given time than your Intelligence Modifier. Example: a level 5 Dark Necromancer with 14 Int could have a single 2HD skeleton, or two 1HD skeletons under their command, while a Dark Necromancer with only 12 Int could only control a single 2HD skeleton) (Weapons, Armor, and batteries sold separately) Beginning at level 5, the Dark Necromancer may forgo their action in order to take control of a skeleton in their command. Doing so grants the skeleton the ability to attack using the player's attack rolls. Beginning at level 10, the Dark Necromancer may also throw their Otherworldly Weapon to a skeleton so that it may make attacks with it in the turn they take control of a skeleton. &amp;#x200B; \-Summoned Skeleton: Armor Class: (as per equipped) Hit Points: (1+ &lt;Wisdom Mod&gt; per HD) Example, if you had 16 Wisdom, they would have 3 health per HD Speed: 15-ft Str 8+ &lt;Wis Mod&gt; Dex 10 Con 10 Int 1 Wis 8 Cha 5 Attacks: Unarmed Attack: +2 to hit, damage: 1d4 +Str mod Proficiencies: Simple weapons, light armor Vulnerabilities: Bludgeoning Damage Damage Immunities: Poison Condition Immunities: Exhaustion, Poisoned Senses: Darkvision 30-ft, passive perception 5 Languages: None - understands and listens only to the whispers and commands of its master. &amp;#x200B; Ritual - Summon Aboneimation Casting Time: 10 consecutive full rounds Range: 5-ft Components: V, M (Very large pile of bones equal to the size being created) Duration: - Description: You have the ability to summon a single creature of bone. Once the ritual has been completed, the bones will begin to bind with dark energy, and 1 round after the ritual has been completed, your dark magic summons forth a creature made of bone that resembles any creature the necromancer has watched die, and dissected using his Otherworldly Weapon. If the Dark Necromancer has summoned an Aboneimation, they are unable to command or control anything other than the Aboneimation. The Aboneimation has a total HD of half your Dark Necromancer level (rounded down) When the Aboneimation is being summoned the Dark Necromancer is allowed to choose a single ""upgrade"" from below: \--&gt; Double the base strength of the Aboneimation \--&gt; Double the base dexterity of the Aboneimation \--&gt; Double the base health of the Aboneimation \--&gt; Attacks from the Aboneimation deal +1 more dice Beginning at level 5, the Dark Necromancer may forgo their action in order to take control of the Aboneimation my merging it with the Dark Necromancer's Otherworldly Weapon for the turn to control it like a puppet. Doing so makes the Aboneimation attack using the commanding player's attack rolls and converts all damage it would deal to Necrotic damage. Beginning at level 10, the Dark Necromancer may also ride the Aboneimation as a mount if it is at least 1 size category larger than the player, but at half the Aboneimations movement speed. \-Summoned Aboneimation: Armor Class: 12+(int mod) Hit Points: (&lt;Wisdom Mod&gt; per HD, minimum of 1) Example, if you had 16 Wisdom, they would have 3 health per HD Size: \-(levels 1-5) Small \-(levels 6-9) Medium (attacks do +2 additional dice of damage) \-(levels 10+) Large (attacks do +4 additional dice of damage) Speed: 15-ft Str 10 Dex 10 Con 10 Int 1 Wis 8 Cha 5 Attacks: (You may choose 1 option each time a new Aboneimation is summoned) Bite: 1d12+str mod piercing Two Claw Attacks: 1d6+str mod slashing Tail Attack: 1d8 bludgeoning+str mod Proficiencies: None Vulnerabilities: Bludgeoning Damage Damage Immunities: Poison Condition Immunities: Exhaustion, Poisoned Senses: Darkvision 30-ft, passive perception 5 Languages: None - understands and listens only to the whispers and commands of its master. &amp;#x200B; Ritual - Summon Bone Armor Casting Time: 2 consecutive full rounds Range: 5-ft Components: V, M (35 pounds of bones and a large intact skull) Duration: - Description: You can use your dark magics to turn a pile of bones into a suit of armor that melds into you - becoming part of you, and protects you from harm. Casting this ritual requires a pile of around 35 pounds of bones as well as a large, intact skull capable of being melded into a helmet that could fit the Necromancers head. This armor counts as Light armor, has all other characteristics as Chainmail armor but it also grant you resistance to slashing damage, and a vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Beginning at level 5 the Dark Necromancer may, as a bonus action, shatter their bone armor, dealing damage to all nearby as fragments of sharp bone explode outward. For every 5 levels the player has in the Dark Necromancer this ability automatically hits - dealing 1d8 piercing damage per player level and has a radius of +5-ft radius. (So at level 10 this ability would deal 10d8 piercing damage with a 10-ft radius hitting friend and foe alike). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Spell - Bone Prison Casting Time: 1 action Range: 15-ft Components: V, M (A fresh corpse within 5-ft of the target creature) Duration: concentration Description: Exerting your dark power, you can tear all bones from a fresh corpse and use them to form a small prison around a medium or smaller target within 5-ft of the corpse. Breaking out of this bone prison requires a strength check of 10+ the Dark Necromancers Wis modifier. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Dark Powers for Absolom, The Book of Bone At each of the levels a Necromancer bound to Absolom, The Book of Bone gains a new Dark Power, they may select one from the following list, and may exchange 1 previous power for a new one from this list if so desired &amp;#x200B; Humanoid creatures under your control gain Medium Armor Proficiency Humanoid creatures under your control gain Heavy Armor Proficiency (requires Medium Armor Proficiency) Humanoid creatures under your control gain Shield Proficiency Humanoid creatures under your control gain Martial Weapon Proficiency Humanoid creatures under your control gain Proficiency with Short and Long Bows All creatures under your control gain +30-ft base movement speed Creatures under your control gain +8 strength Creatures under your control gain +8 dexterity Creatures under your control gain +4 additional health per HD Creatures under your control automatically heal 1 hit point every round Necromantic Rituals that take 2 full round actions can now be cast as a standard action. You may turn your bone armor into a summoned skeleton as a bonus action (destroys the armor). Your Bone armor is now AC 17 &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Mestophales, The Book of Souls Unlocking Mestophales, The Book of Souls gives the Necromancer otherworldly powers that bind, manipulate, torture, and control living souls before they can reach the afterlife - forcing them to do the will of the Necromancer or draining their life force completely before being released to their eternal rest. Unlocking this book immediately grants the Necromancer access to the following spells and abilities &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Dissonant Whispers You may cast the spell Dissonant Whispers a number of times per day equal to your &lt;Int modifier&gt;. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Passive) - Enslaver of Souls Range: 10-ft A Dark Necromancer that wields the Book of Souls can absorb souls into their very core, trapping them within until the Necromancer consumes the souls for power. A Dark Necromancer can store no more than their &lt;Int modifier&gt; times their level of total soul levels at any given time. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Cantrip) - Torture Soul Casting Time: 1 action Range: 5-ft Components: V, M (Soul) Duration: Instantaneous Description: A Necromancer may find pleasure in tormenting the soul of a particular being. Tormenting such a soul causes the soul to cry out in anguish and pain. All intelligent creatures (friend and foe alike) within 5-ft of a Necromancer that uses this cantrip must pass a saving throw or count as feared for their next round. This can only affect a target once per day and the DC to resist is 10+ &lt;Wis modifier&gt;. (Note: Doing this multiple times to the same soul may have varied results depending in the DM) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Cantrip) - Soul Reaper Casting Time: 1 action Range: 5-ft Components: V, M (Otherworldly Weapon) Duration: Instantaneous Description: As part of the action used when casting this spell, the necromancer must make a melee attack with an Otherworldly Weapon against 1 creature within range that has a soul, otherwise the spell fails. On a hit the target takes damage as normal from the weapon and they count as Marked For Death immediately and for 1 round after (see below). &amp;#x200B; Marked For Death Status: A living creature that has been marked for death by the necromancer has already begun to have its very soul ripped out and captured. The next time they would take damage from the necromancer, they take additional necrotic damage equal to the Dark Necromancers &lt;Wis modifier&gt; + &lt;Int modifier&gt;. If a living creature dies while it is marked for death the necromancer may draw the soul into themselves as per the passive ability Enslaver of Souls, gaining a soul whose level is equal to the HD of the target slain. (So a 7HD creature would count as a level 7 soul). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Cantrip) - Consume Soul Casting Time: Bonus Action Range: Self Components: V, M (soul) Duration: Instantaneous Description: As a bonus action a Necromancer may consume souls that they have absorbed - drawing power from them and destroying them forever from the mortal realm. You may consume a level 1 or greater soul, to add 1d4 necrotic damage to the next time you would deal damage. Souls consumed are removed from the Necromancers collected souls forever. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Dark Power) - Soulfire Casting Time: 1 action Range: 30-ft Components: V, M (Otherworldly Weapon) Duration: Special Description: This ability is a Dark Power that is only available to be selected at level 10 or higher. To cast this, you must Consume a soul of level 5 or higher. You then call forth the tormented soul in a spectral form, wreathed in flames of another world and command it to attack a visible enemy within 30-ft of the Dark Necromancer. This tormented soul cannot be destroyed and exists only to cause pain as it lashes out at the enemies the Dark Necromancer directs it at. Each round the Dark Necromancer may command the tormented soul to attack a new target using the attack characteristic below as a standard action. The tormented soul lasts 1 round for ever soul level consumed. Attack: The tormented soul has 2 attacks - using the ""To-hit"" modifier of the Dark Necromancer each attack dealing (1d6 necrotic damage per 2 soul levels of the soul consumed)+int mod. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Dark Powers for Mestophales, The Book of Souls At each of the levels a Necromancer bound to Mestophales, The Book of Souls gains a new Dark Power, they may select one from the following list, and may exchange 1 previous power for a new one from this list if so desired &amp;#x200B; Soulfire (See separate entry above) Soulfire-Spectral Burst: You may destroy a summoned tormented soul to deal 1d10 force damage per soul level in an an area of 1d6(times 5)ft radius(rolled each time). (Standard Action) Necromantic Rituals that take 2 full round actions can now be cast as a standard action. (Cantrip) Soul Shield: Consume a soul to gain temporary health equal to the souls level times your Wis modifier for a number of rounds equal to the soul's level. (Standard action) (Metamagic) Empowered Soul Reaper: Consume a soul to gain an additional 1d6 damage for every 3 levels of the soul to your Soul Reaper if cast this round (example: a level 7 soul would grant +2d6 damage) (Metamagic) Supreme Soul Reaper: Using Soul Reaper already counts the target as having been previously marked for death and the damage is increased to +1d6 for every level of the soul. (requires level 9 or higher) (Ritual) Essence Feeding: Casting this ritual requires 2 consecutive full round actions and a soul of level 3 or greater. Consume this soul to restore your mind and body - healing yourself 1d12 health for every 3 soul \*levels (rounded down). (Metamagic) Empowered Essence Feeding: The amount of health restored is increased to 1d6 per soul level (Requires Essence Feeding) You may now cast the spell Unseen Servant 1/day per 3 levels You may now cast the spell Shield 1/day per 3 levels You may now cast the spell Command 1/day per 3 levels Permanently gain 1d12 hit points &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Terradirge, The Book of Flesh Unlocking Terradirge, The Book of Flesh absorbs the insides of the Necromancer, turning his very core into undead tissue and flesh. Inside the Necromancer finds the secrets, spells, forbidden journals and notes of the undead wizard Tassadar. The notes and spells within the book, combined with his undead insides grant the Necromancer incredible abilities to control dead flesh, raise the dead, and even try to control them. Unlocking this book immediately grants the Necromancer access to the following spells and abilities &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Primal Savagery You learn the cantrip Primal Savagery and use Wisdom as the governing stat for it.

This ability functions for any corpse with HD no greater than half the Necromancers level. The creature raised retains only &lt;Wis modifier&gt; hit points per HD of the creature, a 10-ft normal movement speed, and none of the special or magical abilities it possessed in life. (for example, a dead dragon would not retain its ability to fly or breath weapon attack) but does retain all natural or weapon attacks it had while it was alive. At level 10 or higher, this skill can function on any corpse with HD equal to the Dark Necromancer's level. At level 18 or higher, this skill can function on any corpse with HD equal to the (Dark Necromancer's level + wis modifier). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; (Passive) - Hollow Core Description: Your insides are dead and decaying, yet you can control them and manipulate your external skin to look almost normal for your race. You now count as undead. All positive healing no longer has any effect on you and you are subject to turn undead or any other spells or abilities that would affect undead creatures. You no longer age, you no longer require food or water to sustain yourself, nor do you require sleep.

110,vulnerability,DnD,"Beginner seeking better understanding on some rules, particularly regarding combat mechanics and spells",10,d2s1mp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/d2s1mp/beginner_seeking_better_understanding_on_some/,2019-09-12 01:37:09,"TL;DR with the solid questions at the bottom. Hi! As the title suggests, I'm pretty new to D&amp;D. I've played roughly 24 hours and it was all with the same group, most of whom were also beginners. It was our DM's first time doing so as well. We played textbook 5e with no homebrew or additional content. To be honest, I don't even know where to begin with learning about content not included in the base game. I've learned a lot by reading, but I learn best by experience. I've been looking for a campaign to join, but in several months I haven't found a good fit, so I decided to take a leap and learn to DM for a small group of my friends. They understand I'm still learning, but I still want to do my best. I'm doing my research, stocking up on supplies and asking a lot of questions. The player's handbook and dungeon master's guide have been enormously helpful, but I'm having difficulty grasping some things. If anyone's so kind as to take the time to read all this, I'd like to include what I *think* I know and give you all an opportunity to correct me while I ask questions: \- hit die is determined by class and you roll once for each character level, adding the result to your current Max HP (after level 1) every time you level up. This seems like a common sense thing but I find phrasing in references I've found confusing: **when you reach level 5 (for example), do you roll the hit die one time and add it to your current Max HP, or roll 5 times and re-determine your Max HP entirely?** \- A character's Initiative is equal to their Dexterity modifier, including any active effects on the character's Dexterity. An Initiative roll uses 1d20 and determines turn order in combat. **Is Initiative used for anything else?** \- DC/AC is a hard number that players must match or exceed in order to succeed on a skill check or attack roll. DC is determined by the DM while AC is predesignated based on the enemy's race, class and level. **In general, is determining a monster's AC as simple as reading an entry in the handbook, or do you have to factor other things in?** \- Ability checks use 1d20+\[ability modifier\]+\[proficiency bonus where applicable\]. Ability score and proficiency increases are outlined in class tables. Your ability modifier increases when your ability score does, only if the increase in score puts you in the next bracket on the table. **Are there exceptions to this rule?** \- Saving throws follow the same rules as ability checks, except that they do not use specific skill proficiency and you only get the proficiency bonus if your class table states that you are proficient in saving throws for that ability. **Are there exceptions to this rule?** \- Attack rolls use 1d20+\[ability modifier\]+\[proficiency bonus where applicable\] and are successful if the total is equal to or greater than the target's AC. Successful attack rolls are followed up by damage rolls. Damage rolls are determined by the weapon or spell, the character's proficiency with weapon or spell's associated ability, effects on the weapon, and effects on the character. The total of your damage roll is the total damage the target takes. **Is it true that your ability modifier and proficiency bonus are added twice on your turn - once for the attack roll and once for the damage roll? And if the target is resistant to the type of damage you're dealing, when and how is that resistance factored in?** \- Advantage on a roll means you roll the d20 twice and take the higher roll. Disadvantage means rolling twice and taking the lower roll. This can be used for ability checks, saving throws, or damage rolls. The DM often determines when advantage or disadvantage comes into play based on circumstances like terrain, cover, effects on the character(?), etc. In combat, advantage or disadvantage can be dictated by effects on the attacker or the target, certain actions like *dodge*, and environmental factors. **To follow-up my last question, is this where resistance is factored in?** \- Actions, reactions and bonus actions are labelled as such. In general, a character can take one action, one bonus action where applicable, AND move their full movement speed in a turn. A reaction is the only action that can be taken outside of the player's turn and can be an opportunity attack, a readied action that has been triggered, or a spell that is specified as a reaction. A bonus action can be an offhand attack, a spell that is specified as a bonus action, or a class feature. **Is an offhand attack defined ONLY as an attack with a second weapon when dual-wielding, or can players improvise with their free hand? In general, do the action and bonus action have to be relevant to each other in terms of method, purpose or effect? Are there other types of reactions?** \- Cantrips are specified as such and do not consume a spell slot when cast. Spells are limited by the number of spell slots available, which can be restored after a long rest. Some classes always have the spells they know *prepared* and can use any of them, while others must select the spells they want on deck and can only change them after a long rest. **Do players have to select a certain number of spells to learn from a list of available spells (and can only** ***prepare*** **spells that they have learned), or do they know all available class spells at their level? Is there a cap on the number of times the same cantrip or spell(assuming spell slots are available) can be cast before a long rest? Which classes have to prepare spells, and which can select any learned spell at any time?** &amp;#x200B; I know it's a lot. If you only read or have the answer to one or two questions, I'd still love to hear it. Any insight would be helpful! &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** 1. **Are hit dice re-rolled altogether when you level up, or do you just roll one hit die and add that to the character's current max HP?** 2. **Is Initiative used to determine anything other than combat turn order?** 3. **In general, is determining a monster's AC as simple as reading an entry in the handbook, or do you have to factor other things in?** 4. **Is it true that your ability modifier and proficiency bonus are added twice on your turn - once for the attack roll and once for the damage roll?** 5. **If the target is resistant to the type of damage being dealt, when and how is that resistance factored in?** 6. **Follow-up to the last question: If the target is resistant to the type of damage the attack deals, is that factored in by adding disadvantage to the attack? Likewise with vulnerability-&gt;advantage?** 7. **Is an offhand attack defined ONLY as an attack with a second weapon when dual-wielding, or can players improvise with their free hand?** 8. **In general, do the action and bonus action have to be relevant to each other in terms of method, purpose or effect?** 9. **Are there other types of reactions besides offhand attacks, readied actions and class features?** 10. **Do players have to select a certain number of spells to** ***learn*** **from a list of available spells (and can only** ***prepare*** **spells that they have learned), or do they know all available class spells at their level?** 11. **Is there a cap on the number of times the same cantrip or spell(assuming spell slots are available) can be cast before a long rest?** 12. **Which classes have to prepare spells, and which can select any learned spell at any time?**"
111,vulnerability,DnD,Sometimes you shouldn't stick them with the pointy end,5,d7idg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/d7idg7/sometimes_you_shouldnt_stick_them_with_the_pointy/,2019-09-22 09:33:17,"Yesterday I played a brand new character, a few sessions into a campaign. I was sad to have my monk die at second level the previous session, but in truth he was turning out not to be the right character for this campaign and this party. He was also still enough of a blank slate for me to have a do-over with the same character concept (in the circumstances, probably a reincarnation of the original), hopefully in a campaign where he'll work better. So I rock up with my brand new dragonborn barbarian. There were so many cool things about that session that I could go on far longer than anyone wants to read. I'm just overall *stoked* at how it went, and most of all how well she fitted into the party from the get-go. It's a crazy party and the monk was way too sane for them. But I'll stick to one anecdote that just made me really happy. We're fighting a trio of skeletons (in a well-known adventure. If you guess where we are you get an imaginary cookie.) I know that skeletons are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. My barbarian probably doesn't *know* it (I thought long and hard about her build and ended up dumping *all* the mental stats. We do point buy and I bought three 15s and three 8s, before racial bonuses) but I'm able with only a little reaching to justify her wanting to hit them with something that was neither edged nor pointy. Unfortunately, she carries a greatsword, some javelins, and a handaxe (usually two but she lent one to a small child.) Fortunately, while I'm not exactly an expert on medieval sword-fighting, I know a few tidbits. While I wait for my turn I grab my PHB and refresh my memory on the improvised weapon rules. I reverse my greatsword and grip it by the blade. I pause here to explain that this type of sword, while sharp, wouldn't be razor sharp, and as long as my grip doesn't slip I won't be cut. I'm rather expecting the DM to quibble but he evidently knows the same medieval sword-fighting factoids I do. I read out the line about proficiency at the DM's option if the improvised weapon resembles a weapon the character is proficient with, reminding him that I'm proficient with whatever we decide this resembles, *and* the weapon I'm actually using in this way - which is a legitimate sword-fighting technique from the medieval manuals. He agrees: I'm considered proficient. This is good because I proceed to roll a 9, and that +2 makes all the difference. My opening bid is war-hammer: I wouldn't have complained if he'd counter-offered something a size smaller, but he accepts it without a murmur. I swing one of the crossguards at my foe's head. I don't roll high on the damage, but with the vulnerability it's enough to take out the almost-unhurt skeleton in one go. In actual fact, I could potentially have rolled more than double the damage using the sword normally. I got 6 all told, 12 when doubled, and without critting or raging I can potentially roll 15 with my greatsword. But it wouldn't have felt half as cool as using real sword-fighting knowledge to convince the DM to let me go off-piste to creatively exploit the enemy's vulnerability. We pretty much ran the gamut of the improvised weapon rules in that fight. We had a monk *throwing* shortswords, and a skeleton finding itself in melee with a barbarian, armed only with a bow and trying to club me with it."

It shelters travelers from the cold of the night. Mothers use it to cook food for their children. Forge masters bathe metal in it to shape mighty blades for battle and the nails others use to build their homes. Fire is life. But for those who choose the path of evil, a Paladin who swears the Oath of The Firebringer most certainly their doom. It is said that warriors carry a fire in their soul that fuels them in battle. Firebringers unleash their inner flame beyond any other warrior and use its power to burn evil away from the world wherever it hides and bring the light of the gods down to shelter the innocent. Tenets of The Firebringer **Purge in Flame.** Just as fire burns away dead and diseased plants to make way for new life, so to will you seek out and burn away evil to make way for peace and happiness. **Shelter in Warmth.** Shelter the innocent in the warmth of your flame and protect them from forces that seek to prey upon them just as fire wards away hungry wolves. **Live in Light.** Kindle your inner flame. Lead by example and spread the light of the gods as a beacon of strength and shelter for that is good, and a torch of fury and wrath for all that is evil.

As an action you can choose one creature that you can see within 60 feet of you and force it to make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save the creature is wreathed in fire, causing it to take fire damage equal to your charisma modifier at the beginning of each of its turns. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn. Any creature that has vulnerability to fire makes this saving throw at disadvantage. Solar Flare. As an action you can choose an amount of creatures you can see within 30 feet of you and force them to make a constitution saving through. On a failed save the creatures are blinded and knocked prone. Any creature that has vulnerability to fire or radiant damage makes this saving throw at disadvantage. Any creature that does not rely on sight or is blind is immune to being blinded. Aura of Holy Fire. Starting at 7th level, while you are conscious, you and friendly creatures within ten feet of you deal extra radiant or fire damage (your choice) equal to 1d4 plus your charisma modifier on the first attack on each turn. This damage extends to all damage dealing spells. This aura extends to 30 feet at 18th level. Phoenix Starting at 15th level whenever you drop to zero hit points, you can instead choose to drop to 1 instead. When you do this, every hostile creature in your Aura of Holy Fire must make a constitution saving throw. On a failed save they take damage equal to your paladin level or half as much damage (rounded up) on a successful one. Once you use this ability, you cant use it again until you finish a long rest. Angel of Fire At 20th level you can unleash your inner flame to its fullest and assume the mantle of an angle of fiery wrath. Your skin takes on the appearance of holy fire and you sprout wings of flame. You shed bright light out to 60 feet and dim light for 30 feed beyond that. At the start of each of your turns, all hostile creatures in your Aura of Holy Fire take radiant or fire damage (your choice) equal to 1d8 plus your charisma modifier. If a creature makes an attack roll against any friendly creature in your aura, the attacker must make a constitution saving throw or take the same damage. You gain a flying speed of thirty feet. Any magically created darkness and any vapors, magical or otherwise are burned away in your aura."

Action Surge. You use Commanders Strike to command your Rogue ally to Sneak attack, at advantage, and add your superiority dice roll from Commanders Strike to the damage. Which is doubled bc the BBEG is vulnerable from your channel divinity: path to the grave. Assuming the party is all level 7 - which is your minimum level needed to achieve this combo, the average amount of damage you could deal with a Rogue ally wielding a rapier is: {4 (weapon dmg) + 12 (4d6 Sneak attack dmg) + 4 (Your 1d8 Superiority dice damage boost)} x 2 (path to the grave vulnerability) = **40 damage.** I know this isnt game-changing, considering this is below average damage output for a level 8 wizard with fireball, but considering this comes with 2 more rounds of being able to force disadvantage on the target from your Goading Strike, and the ability to heal, its a pretty sweet deal.

[5e]",1,dcn4ne,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/dcn4ne/homebrewing_new_warlock_subclass_anarchist_patron/,2019-10-03 16:40:29," I noticed that there are several extraplanar entities that should be powerful enough to grant warlock pacts, but don't have any logically corresponding warlock subclass. Such as Modron Hierarchs, Slaad Lords, Rilmani Arurumachs, and the Archomentals. So I decided to homebrew three pacts in the hopes that I would eventually learn how to art so as to put it on the DMs guild. I will be dedicating a separate post for each subclass so as to avoid wall-of-text syndrome. (For the First pact, the Archomental Patron, go here: [URL and for the second, the Axiomite patron, go here: [URL This particular sublcass is meant to be, a chaotic-aligned Outer-planar pact to the Celestial's Good and the Fiend's Evil. It's meant to be well, what would happen if you asked Florida Man for magic powers. # The Anarchist An Anarchist is a Chaotic-aligned being native to the afterlife planes of the Great Wheel. Potential patrons for this pact include the Demon Princes and Princesses of The Abyss, the Slaad Lords of Limbo, and The Asuran Commanders of Arborea. They believe that the world should not be regulated and that people should be free to go about their business as they see fit. ## Expanded Spell List Lv1: *Chaos Bolt (Xan), Enlarge/Reduce* Lv2: *Mirror Image***,** *Rope Trick* Lv3: *Blink***,** *Enemies Abound* Lv4: *Confusion, polymorph* Lv5: *Synaptic Static (Xan), Reincarnate* ## Numeric Anarchy Starting at 1st level, on your turn, you can use your action to one creature and roll 1d6. 1=Strength, 2=dexterity, 3=Constitution, 4=Intelligence, 5=Wisdom, and 6=Charisma. Whichever number you roll, the target must make a saving throw using that ability. If it fails, you deal 1d4 damage to any single numeric stat of your choice, such as base movement speed, Initiative Modifier, an ability modifier, or remaining spell slots (If you select spell slots, then the level of spell slot you want to remove equals how many points of damage it takes to remove. If you roll a 5, for example, you can opt to remove one fifth level spell slot, one fourth level and one first, one third level and two first levels, etc). This ability is capable of reducing certain stats, such as ability modifiers or the proficiency bonus, to negative values. Whatever stat you choose to affect in this way, the damage is removed after a Long Rest. The damage dealt by *Numeric Anarchy* increases with your warlock level. It becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level. You can use this ability once per short or long rest. ## Chaotic Inversion Your patron is a Chaotic-aligned being who is not necessarily consistent in their behavior, so starting at 6th level, you gain one of three new benefits based on what pact boon you chose at 3rd level. \*If you chose Pact of the Chain, once per long rest, if you can see a living creature within 60ft that has zero hit points, you can use your action on your turn to instantly revive it to half its full hit points (rounded up) at the cost of simultaneously reducing yourself to zero hit points. \*If you chose Pact of the Blade, once per long rest, you can use your standard action to attempt a sleight of hand check (you can opt to use your charisma modifier instead of dexterity for sleight of hand checks done for the purpose of using this ability) to magically swap one nonmagical item on your person of your choice with one nonmagical item of your choice on the person of a creature you can see. If you succeed, then the creature in question must immediately make a perception check. If it passes the check (which you can choose to have happen automatically), it is immediately made aware that its item has been replaced and reacts accordingly. If fails, it is not made aware that its item has been replaced with another until it tries to interact with it in some way. If you used this to take an enemy or ally rogues dagger while you are holding food, for example, they would not realize that they had lost their weapon until they tried to slit someones throat with a sausage. The two items swapped in this way, however, must be of roughly the same size and general shape. A dagger can be swapped with a sausage, for example, but it cannot be swapped with a glove. The two items swapped in this way must also not be in extradimensional spaces connected to magic items. You could swap out a rock located in your pocket, for example, but you could not swap out a rock located inside a *bag of holding* you were carrying. \*If you chose Pact of the Tome, then whenever a spell is cast at you, you can use your reaction to designate another creature you can see to be affected by that spell instead of you. This ability can be used with area of effect spells, but it only relocates the portion of the *effect* that *you in particular* would otherwise receive, not the area of terrain cast at, and you cannot designate a target that is already in the area of effect. You can only use this ability once per short or long rest. ## Armor Class Override Starting at 10th level, you can use a bonus action to replace the AC of one creature of your choice (which can be yourself) with a number equal to its dexterity modifier plus the result of a roll on a 1d20. The creature in question is only affected this way if it fails a wisdom save, which it can choose to fail automatically. This effect lasts for 1d8 rounds. This effect is negated by effects that also affect Armor Class, such as the *Mage Armor* spell. A creatures Armor Class cannot be affected by your *Numeric Anarchy* ability if said creature is currently under the effects of your *Armor Class Override* ability, and you cannot target a creature with *Armor Class Override* if Its AC is currently reduced by your *Numeric Anarchy* ability. ## Game of Chance Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to spend your action and a warlock spell slot to roll a d12 and affect yourself with one of the following effects. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until its effects wear off: 1)You cast *Hold Person* on yourself. 2)The last creature you dealt HP damage to that still has hit points is enlarged as though you had cast an *enlarge/reduce* spell on it. 3)At first, nothing seems to happen. But at the end of the turn of the creature immediately after you in the initiative order, your head explodes, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to all creatures and objects within 5ft of you, causing your body to slump to the floor. This does not actually kill you, however, as the chaotic magical energy coursing through you keeps you alive but unconscious until your turn 1d4 rounds later, at which point your head regrows. You cannot be healed by any means until your head regrows. You retain no memories of anything that transpired while you were headless. 4)For 1d4 rounds, you gain vulnerability to the type of damage you most recently received. If the last attack you received dealt more than one type of damage, roll between them randomly. 5) A soft noise of flatulence is heard throughout the room (100ft radius centered on you if you are outdoors or the room is larger than 100ft), but does not seem to originate from any one point. The spell slot you used to activate *Game of Chance* is refunded to you, but not your action. 6) the 1d6 creatures nearest to you, friend or foe, take a number of d4s equal to your charisma modifier in Force Damage 7)A modified *Delayed Blast Fireball* bead manifests in your hands (if you were holding anything at the time, everything you were holding is transported to a special demiplane and reappears in your hands after the fireball goes off). It has a blast radius of one creature, and does not take up your concentration slot, instead going off on its own after 2d4 rounds, rolled for randomly by the DM, who does not tell you the result. On your next turn, you can use your action to pass the bead into the hands (or barring the presence of hands, another suitable anatomical structure) of a creature within 5ft of you, which is magically compelled to accept. A creature currently holding the bead has its base movement speed doubled for as long as it holds the bead, but it cannot use its action for anything but passing the bead onto another creature. Once the requisite number of rounds has elapsed, the bead explodes, dealing 12d6 points of fire damage to whatever creature is currently holding it at the start of its turn. 8) You cast *Darkness*, centered on yourself. 9)For 1d4 rounds, you gain resistance to the type of damage you most recently received.

If you were already at maximum HP when you used this feature, you instead gain 2d6 temporary hit points, which can be dismissed with a bonus action. 11)The last creature that dealt HP damage to you but which still has hit points is reduced as though you had cast an *enlarge/reduce* spell on it. 12)You gain 1d20 Temporary hit points, a strength score of 20 (if you already had a strength score of 20 or more, then your strength score is not changed by this effect), and a magic +3 greatsword appears in your hands (if you are already holding something in one or both hands when you activate this feature, everything you were holding is temporarily transferred to a special demiplane and reappears in your hands when the effect wears off). If you are not proficient with greatswords when you activate this feature, you temporarily gain said proficiency. The DM rolls a 1d8 but does not tell you the result. After that number of rounds, your strength score returns to normal, and all remaining temporary hit points that you got from this effect disappear, as does the greatsword and your proficiency with it, assuming you were not proficient with greatswords before you activated *Game of Chance*."

121,vulnerability,DnD,[5e][help] Anyone aid me in making an anti-party of NPCs?,5,cqi0c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/cqi0c5/5ehelp_anyone_aid_me_in_making_an_antiparty_of/,2019-08-15 09:49:49,"So I'm a DM of 12 of my friends (yes, I know it's a lot, but I'm able to manage it fairly well). We're playing my own campaign in 5e. Thing is, they're all 6th level, and now able to mow down pretty much anything CR 10 or below fairly easily. They are all having fun, and I've received feedback on how to make things better, but I want to try something unique. As in creating a party of opposing NPCs that could act as a yin/yang style counter to the current party. Since my campaign is fluid enough, I have several options on how to implement them, but I'm leaning towards the ""they're hired mercenaries acting on the evil cult's behalf."" I'll include anything about the characters I think can be built off of. Here's a list of my players: 1. Human Battlemage\* (homebrew wizard-fighter type class) with high AC and moderate health. She can imbue her weapon (longsword) with various spells that are expended when she hits a creature. Also slow to trust her party members and is a bit of a lone wolf. 2. Half-Elf Arcane Trickster Rogue, really likes using poison and acid damage, (although the player is somewhat demoralized by the lack of creatures with poison vulnerability), although not super sneaky. 3. Dullahan\* College of Whispers Bard (the race is an undead cursed sort of thing, his head is removable and has a pool of temporary hp, is considered a tiny creature, but his body has 30ft. blindsight when it is away.) Taking his head from his body may be a reliable method of taking him out. 4. Mogogol\* Hunter Ranger (little frog dude, similar to a grung, almost exclusively uses ranged attacks). 5. Kenku Drunken Master Monk with 20 dex and 6 int, personality is akin to Rico from the Penguins of Madagascar show (this is really fun roleplay, but he's really annoying in combat). Movement speed is 45ft., plus his unarmored defense makes his AC 16, so he's difficult to hit. 6. Goliath Zealot Barbarian, 7 int (this is pretty self-explanatory). 73 health, high con and str. 7. Aarakocra Cleric (adoptive father of the 10 year old elf child, overprotective), fights from a distance. 8. High Elf Runechild\* Sorcerer (homebrew subclass, uses sorcery points for different effects) Very glass-cannon -esque character with very little health, but massive amounts of AoE damage. In the game, his character is a 10 year old orphaned elf child trying to find her parents/family. 9. Triton Vengeance Paladin - often can't come to meetings, but when he can, he acts as a brother-in-arms character to his fellow vengeance paladin, these two are a tank duo (he has across-the table just above average stats) 10. Blugruim\* Vengeance Paladin with a Con 20, this guy has a whopping 75 health at level 6, as well as the typical paladin Lay on Hands and Divine smite. 11. Draconic Angel\* Ancient Paladin 30 fly speed, resistant to fire, more just above average stats, highest being 15 wis. 12. Yuan-Ti Artillerist Artificer - Poison immunity, arcane turret, extra cantrip wand, 20 int, 16 con. I've marked all of the hombrew races, classes, and subclasses with a \*, although for the members of the anti-party I'm trying to shy away from using homebrew classes, although I'm fairly open to this website for the races: [URL Although, I'm running a serious campaign and have told one character that he could not choose ""neko"" as his race, and that's going to go the same for the anti party, as well as no pokemon races like Furret or Greninja. So far, I've been thinking of using the Orc race from Volo's Guide to create a Monk to face off against the Kenku, since an orc can move up to it's movement speed toward an opponent as a bonus action, making the top speed per turn 135ft (because of monk's unarmored movement speed at 6th level). Or I could use the bonus action, run up to the Kenku, attempt to grapple, and then move halfway back if successful. I'm hoping some people on here can help me out by just creating one or two, anything helps. Level 6 if possible. (Also don't be afraid to ask for more info if necessary, I may have something else that helps) Thanks, everyone!"

After clearing it out they saved a Ranger who was a Monster Hunter by trade who promised them a reward for saving her life. I was thinking that after harvesting the remains of the Spiders (which my party had left behind) she would call in a favour and get a friendly enchanter to make them a Spider-themed Magical Item. I was initially going to give them Slippers of Spider Climbing but as the Druid gets Spider Climb as one of his Circle spells (Forest) I didn't want another party member to overshadow his niche. So instead I made up my own item based on the Giant Spider's Web attack: **Glove of Webbing** \- The white and light blue, almost translucent, colouration of the glove is uncomfortably familiar. The Glove has 3 Charges. While the glove is worn, as part of the Attack Action you can expend a charge, by making the correct hand gesture, and will shoot Webbing as a Ranged Weapon Attack targeted at one creature with +5 to hit at a reach of 30/60 feet. On a hit the target is Restrained by webbing and, as an Action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage) The glove regains One charge per dawn. If the last charge is expended roll a D20, on a 1 it becomes permanently non-magical. &amp;#x200B; My question is on the balance of this item for the party's current power level, if any changes should be made (like it requiring attunement) and if anyone has any other spider-related items that I could use instead?"
125,vulnerability,DnD,So I'm trying to homebrew a Skeleton Player race....,1,ctn486,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/ctn486/so_im_trying_to_homebrew_a_skeleton_player_race/,2019-08-22 07:09:02,"So I'm trying to homebrew a PC Skeleton Race and I have never homebrewed before. I've been researching into it and looking at different skeletal undead monsters as well as other peoples homebrew for inspiration but I come to a roadblock and feel I need some input on the matter. So here is my thought process so far... Ability score is easy, +2 to Consitution because bones are pretty sturdy things and +1 to Dexterity because again they're nothing but bones I imagine they are quite agile. Age...well they are undead so they don't age or die from old age but I can imagine their bones deteriorating over time if they are not actively looking after their own bones or finding replacements. Alignment in my head I have to go with Neutral but there can be good or evil ones depending on what brought them back to life. Size simple Medium or small depending on what race the skeleton was when it was alive. Darkvision 60ft, I will be honest just borrowing this from the monster manual. Then this is where some of my ideas begin to hinder me as I don't know if they would work well unless of course, I playtest it. &amp;#x200B; Since I am playing an undead character I think its only fair to be affected by things as an undead would. So the obvious being immune to poison, being poisoned and exhaustion as the undead don't need to eat or sleep. As well as keeping the vulnerability to bludgeoning damage as they have no flesh to help cushion the blow but maybe giving them resistance to piercing damage as well they are nothing but bones. Then here comes the part I'm completely stumped on, spell effects and cleric/ paladin abilities concerning undead. It would make sense to just follow the rules but I feel that might make survivability very hard. So with no healing magic to help the PC and some actually being more detrimental than good, its a good chance they might go down hard and fast...especially considering I would want to keep bludgeoning as a weakness so that's double damage. I also feel since they have no guts they couldn't receive the benefits from health potions as you need to drink the potions to get the effects and skeletons can't really eat or drink, in reality, it would just go through them. So far I can only really think of out of combat fixes to this problem(besides short and long rests), like being able to replace broken or damaged bones with suitable ones found about the place and letting PC roll a hit die to resort some health. Another idea I had was maybe letting the skeleton race have access to health potions by soaking bandages in the potion and wrapping it around the damaged parts. Though again this would be an out of combat fix to the problem or as if it was happening during combat it would most likely have to take multiple turns to accomplish. This would also have to be a GM ok'd thing as again I know the wording of health potions states it needs to be drunk. This is the roadblock I am at. &amp;#x200B; Also, don't get me started on concerns of player death and if the party wants to revive the skeleton PC...though thinking about it if someone cast True Resurrection on the Skeleton PC and they came back as their living version that would make for an interesting story point."

Living hives are created when a person, either by choice or through forced experimentation, forms a symbiotic relationship with a large swarm of insects (I'm thinking bees). They provide the insects a home in the form of their body, and in turn are granted control over the insects. They get +2 to con, because being full of bugs makes them a bit sturdier than flesh and blood. They gain immunity to poison, but vulnerability to fire. They get access to the druid cantrip Infestation, as well as Hellish Rebuke, as per the tiefling, but instead of fire it's bugs."

Speed: Your base flying speed is 25 feet. Limbless: you have no arms and no legs and cannot manipulate objects. Firey Body: Your body when you are active is constantly aflame you have immunity to fire and radiant damage. Anything you touch while your active takes 1d4 fire and 1d4 radiant damage anything you touch that can be ignited is. vulnerability: You have vulnerability to cold damage Illumination: The SUN sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 ft. You have a disadvantage on stealth checks Water Susceptibility: For every 5 ft. a sun moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage. False Appearance: While you remain motionless, you are indistinguishable from a piece of junk made of stone and metal, with glasses. Creatures with the ability to see or feel magic can however detect the magic within you. Firey Construct. You are not organic. Your creature type is construct. As such, spells like cure wounds don't affect you, and you are immune to spells like crown of madness or dominate person because they specifically target humanoids. You are immune to diseases. You do not need air you do however need fuel, anything brought into your body that can be burned up counts. Rather than sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 6 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you are fully aware of your surroundings and notice approaching enemies and other events as normal. and gain the effects of False Appearance. Magical Being: As you are a magical Construct, it is only giving you to this life. You are incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute. Mendable: You can be mended like an object, not healed like an organic thing. When the mending spell is cast on you, it has the following alterations: It has a casting time of 1 action. If you have 0 hit points you become stable. As part of the casting of mending the caster may expend any level of spell slot to cause you to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8, plus their spellcasting ability modifier. For each level of the spell slot expended you regain an additional 1d8 hit points. Languages: You can speak, read and write in Common. So how mechanically sound is this is what I want to know class wise shes going to be a Sorcerer (Phoenix Sorcery) and will be getting mage hand from that.

Here is my 2 cents on a very specific topic: Being a good player in a Homebrew game's combat. &amp;#x200B; First thing to note, this post is not about encounters that are wildly unbalanced or the like. It will also vary if you have a very new DM or the like as well, so take this with a grain of salt. &amp;#x200B; SO our PCs, The Wild Stallions, come across a a Troll and pour on the hurt with bursts of damage. Trolls are rare to unheard of in this setting as they were slain to near extinction by the great Hero Ruffus. The PCs end their turn and the DM describes the Troll's wounds as closing and the trickles of sickly black blood slowing. ""Hey! It shouldn't be healing! I used fire and Ted used acid!"" exclaims Bill.... What is wrong here? &amp;#x200B; The first is that it would seem that Bill is using bogus meta game knowledge. He as a player has seen the troll's stat block and knows its regeneration is nullified by fire and acid, but because the player knows doesn't mean the PC should know this. This being said it could just be coincidence that they used those specific damage types.... unlikely but still... They don't know that their DM changed it to lightning damage and gave it vulnerability to lightning as well to make the moment they figured this out (if they did) a much bigger pay off. &amp;#x200B; The bigger issue in my view is how Bill is handling this. He is telling the DM the abilities right out of the book. Not only is there a good chance this will annoy the DM, it loses a golden RP moment. The lost moment might be something like ""T......TED?!? WHAT can WE dOoOoO?!? I thought that smell was bad but it heals too??"". That moment of a PC trying to figure out what is going on is playing your PC. Telling them DM what the book says on a monster is trying to play the DM. &amp;#x200B; The moral of the story? Be radical and play your PC, NOT the DM!"

The dragon had guiding bolt cast on it the round before and the next whatever attack hit it next had vulnerability to that damage so it was up to our Druid as the dragon was next who had three attacks and 3 unconscious bodies that all had one death saving throw failed already, meaning when it hit them they were dead dead.

I'm still new to reddit. I am trying to make a cursed magic item that is essentially a still beating heart the adventurers will find. If they attune the magic heart or kill it the heart dies and the persons heart will teleport out of their body into their hand still beating. They have no way of getting their heart back in their chest. They immediately know this is their heart and that they will die if it dies. So I am looking for opinions on what level magic to assign to be able to reverse this. I think remove curse is too easy. Also I really would like to give the adventurer some benefit from the curse as well, though not one that outweighs the negatives significantly. The first thing that comes to mind is that when the player would die from nonmagical damage they instead wake up with 1hp after 1d4 hours. This seems very powerful to me though. I'm struggling between this being the boon that I think makes the most sense and the fact that at this point it seems like the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. However, if I can' think of something better I may just make sure the character never feels quite at ease about the vulnerability of the heart outside the body. Thanks for your thoughts."

So I have some questions about creating an undead PC. This actually isn't going to be mine, it's going to be my friend who will be playing in a game I will be DM'ing. He had a character idea to be a human who in the past was a king of a large and prosperous nation. Sometime during his rule he was betrayed and overthrown by an unknown figure and imprisoned. He was tortured to death, and then his enemies resurrected him to torture him more. Through someone yet to be named (he just text me about this 5 minutes ago lol we have yet to flesh out the details) he escaped, and is now an undead player looking for adventure. He said he wants to be more of a skeleton than a zombie, so I looked at the MM's description of skeleton and used that as a basis to write a real quick rough draft of what a skeleton PC may look like: \-Retains Human benefits \-Vulnerability to bludgeoning damage \-Immunity to poison dmg/being poisoned \-Darkvision 60 ft. \-Quirk: Healing potions/healing spells (anything that would normally cause an increase of HP) all cause damage, while poisons and poison-based attacks heal HP. Anyone know of a good already made skeleton PC? Or maybe could you help me flesh out the details for this? Thanks y'all"
140,vulnerability,DnD,"How Tomb of Levistus can save your life and, possibly, kill someone at the same time!!",14,c8aetu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/c8aetu/how_tomb_of_levistus_can_save_your_life_and/,2019-07-03 01:13:15,"TL;DR: A warlock with ToL could turn themselves into a 7000 lb block of ice to save themselves from fall damage and potentially damage (or even outright kill) foes! So for those of you that arent aware, Xanathars Guide to Everything introduced some new Eldritch Invocations including one called Tomb of Levistus (ToL). The text of that invocation reads as follows: Prerequisite: 5th level As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the damage, you gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts. Once you use this invocation, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. With that out of the way lets talk about the inspiration for this post. Last Sunday, the group I game with via roll20 found ourselves atop a 130 ft ledge that overlooked some sort of room at the bottom. We gathered up our ropes and our ranger rappelled down accompanied by our druid who had wildshaped into a giant lizard. They descended into the room, with the ranger staying above the floor by clinging to the rope. Meanwhile, the druid decided to investigate the floor further only to disturb some earth elementals that were beneath the dirt. Our party rolled initiative. During this combat our pact of the blade hexblade warlock realized she would be ineffective with no line of sight and from such a high ledge. She took a look at her invocations and saw she still had ToL prepped and ready. Its at this point that our DM made the ruling that ToL could be used to negate fall damage since the skill says that you use it as a reaction when you take damage. The fact that it doesnt specify a damage type means that any damage can trigger it. She then proceeded to jump from the ledge!! After several Assassins Creed jokes, she used her 7th level ToL to negate all 13d6 of damage and landed unharmed on the ground below. Ultimately, our party managed to get out of that hole and climb back up unscathed. However, our warlocks daring BASE jump caused myself and one of the other party members to consider methods of weaponizing ToL. Now bear in mind, doing this would take some pre-planning on the part of the party but it could be done. Consider this, a medium sized creature (eg all PC races) take up a 5 ft square of space. If we expand this space three dimensionally, its actually a 5x5x5 ft space. This means each medium sized creature takes up 125 cubic feet of space. Now in most cases its assumed that the creature doesnt have that actual volume but any attack or AoE that intersects the space hits the creature inside. However, ToL states that you encase yourself in ice. Lets assume that the ice takes up the full 125 cubic feet of volume. Then (according to this calculator: URL the resulting weight of the ice would be 7171.41 lbs! From this number, it became clear that we could consider the weight of the PC and their equipment to be negligible relative to the ice itself. Furthermore, we calculated how fast the object would be traveling (ignoring air resistance, drag, etc) when it reached the bottom of the 130 ft drop using the equation v = at + v_o. Here v_o (the initial velocity) is zero, a (the acceleration) is 32 ft/sec^2, and t is the time in seconds. To this, we also use the equation d = 1/2 at^2. Solving for t (we know the distance is 130 ft), and using it in the velocity equation we can see that the object will be traveling at a speed of approximately 91.21 ft/sec. Thats approximately 62 miles per hour! Thus, had our partys warlock hit something the impact wouldve been equivalent to hitting a pedestrian with a truck going 60 mph. This means that if a warlock prepped with ToL leapt from a ledge onto the head of an enemy, they could immediately turn into a 7000 lb ice block and deal a massive amount of bludgeoning damage and, depending on the height which would determine the speed of the block, and the creature they hit, it could kill something outright. Im curious to know the communitys thoughts on this. Perhaps it could be used by the forces of some BBEG to create a paratrooper corp of ToL warlocks."

AND War caster feat. as he walks up to me I cast Hold Person. He fails the save and is Paralyzed. Other player, Ranged Fighter / Warlock multiclass mops up the minions, because HEX, Sharpshooter and 3000 attacks per round. My turn comes and BBEG and his minions watch in horror as I use Channel Divinity PATH TO THE GRAVE, giving the poor sob vulnerability to next damage he takes. DM at this point asks why do I hoard all the d10 dice from the table. Being multiclassed Fighter I use Action Surge to cast INFLICT WOUNDS at 3rd lvl. 5d10 Necrotic damage, but it is an automatic critical AND he has vulnerability to all damage. After BBEG is taking 20D10 Necrotic damage in one hit, the adventure is over. Now back to DMing again."
142,vulnerability,DnD,[5e][Homebrew] D20 Long rest consequences for all lifestyles/living conditions,177,c92azx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/c92azx/5ehomebrew_d20_long_rest_consequences_for_all/,2019-07-04 22:58:51,"Taking a long rest is not always a textbook perfect night. Situations can arise, good or bad, each with their own consequences. When the party takes a long rest, roll a d20 and compare to the chart below. Match the result with their living conditions for resting to determine what the consequence of that rest is, and what check the party members must each make, or the individual in the party with the largest involvement in a party result. The number in the table determine the Consequence DC. Where no number is listed, no consequence occurs. For example, on a roll of 2, the party may be attacked by animals unless the most involved individual beats the consequence DC of 15 for wretched conditions, or 12 for squalid conditions. In all other conditions, animals would not be attacking. Refer to the Players Handbook for descriptions of the living conditions. Excluded consequences may still occur at DM's discretion should it fit the situation, such as a comfortable house that was designed to handle only dry warm nights suddenly being forced to endure cold rain. Similarly the DM may rule that a certain consequence is impossible, in which case nothing happens, such as the inability to meet a fellow guest in a completely empty wasteland. Each consequence is outlined below, including limited suggestions on how the party may improve their handling of those consequences by earning advantage. d20| Consequence | Wretched | Squalid|Poor| Modest|Comfortable| Wealthy| Aristocratic ---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- 1| Exposed to the elements| 18| 14 |10 |6 |- |- |- 2| Attacked by animals|15 |12 |- |- |- |- |- 3| Attacked by people|16 |15 |13 |10 |10 |10 |10 4| Theft|16 |14 |13 |10 |10 |10 |10 5| Disease|18 |16 |13 |11 |10 |10 |10 6| Uncomfortable sleep|16 |14 |12 |10 |6 |- |- 7| Disturbance|16 |16 |14 |14 |10 |10 |- 8| Marked|10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 |10 9-12| Nothing|- |- |- |- |- |- |- 13| Perfect awakening|20 |18 |17 |16 |15 |14 |13 14| Hearty meal|- |20 |18 |16 |14 |13 |12 15| Clarity of mind|20 |20 |17 |14 |11 |10 |10 16| Rapid Recovery|- |- |20 |17 |14 |10 |10 17| Interact with Host|15 |15 |15 |15 |15 |15 |15 18| New lead|- |20 |17 |15 |15 |15 |15 19| Fellow guest|15 |15 |15 |15 |15 |15 |15 20| Gift or prize|- |20 |18 |16 |14 |14 |14 ##Negative consequences Exposed to the elements Whether in the biting cold of a winter's night, or the searing heat of the plane of fire, rest without shelter is difficult in harsh elements. If your character is exposed to the elements, make a **Constitution** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, the rest completes normally. On a failure, exhaustion sets in. Your exhaustion level moves one step closer to 2, or one step closer to 6 if you fail the DC by 5 or more. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of additional sheltering supplies, such as a tent or fire. Attacked by animals Unsuitably guarded locations can lead to attacks from local beasts, monstrosities, or worse. This kind of attack will be motivated more by supplies and survival. Preparation is key to handling an attack. Make a skill check that is most relevant to the preparations made against the consequence DC. On a failure, or if the DM rules that preparation isn't appropriate to dissuade the attack entirely, it's time to roll initiative. On a success, the attackers back off before a true threat is made, and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this check may be granted for use of visible traps, alerts, or guards that reduce your apparent vulnerability. Attacked by people Unsuitably guarded loot or wanted persons can lead to attacks from humanoids and other sentient creatures. This kind of attack will be motivated more by greed or higher goals. Preparation is key to handling an attack. Make a skill check that is most relevant to the preparations made against the consequence DC. On a failure, or if the DM rules that preparation isn't appropriate to dissuade the attack entirely, it's time to roll initiative. On a success, the attackers back off before a true threat is made, and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this check may be granted for use of visible traps, alerts, or guards that reduce your apparent vulnerability. Theft Sometimes creatures covet what you have enough to desire a surprise change in ownership without combat. For this to occur, first the thief has to believe you hold something they want. Make a **Charisma** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a failure, your actions have led the thief to the conclusion you're the mark they want. Follow stealth rules as appropriate. On a success, the thief looks elsewhere tonight. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of visible traps, alerts, or guards that make the risk of the thief being caught appear higher. Disease Unseen and unheard, disease and infection can strike anyone at any time. Perhaps the Gods will it, or perhaps it's the work of something more worldly. In any case, you're exposed. Make a **Constitution** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a failure, you contract a disease of the DM's choosing, or otherwise gain the poisoned condition indefinitely until cured. On a success, what may be was not, and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of substantially higher quality supplies than the living conditions would suggest, being in particular favor of the most influential deity for the local area, or for having resistance or immunity to poison damage. Uncomfortable sleep Tossing and turning, waking up early, or just having a twist in one's back during the night are all impactful on getting a good rest. Make a **Constitution** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a failure, you do not regain hit dice. On a successful save, the rest completes normally, although not without complaint. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of additional comforting aid, such as a bedroll, or sleeping potion. A suitable partner may or may not help in this way too, at DM's discretion. Disturbance Noise, bright lights, offensive smells, or other general intrusions upon rest can upset the benefits of anyone's night. Make a **Wisdom** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a failure, the disturbance prevents proper recovery, and you do not regain hitpoints. On a success you shut out the world and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of additional barriers to outside such as earmuffs, extra window coverings, or darkness/silence enhancing magic. Marked Trackers, watchers, spies, and others stalk the night. Some follow you for a mission, others catch a whiff of overheard conversation. One way or the other, these creatures will not reveal themselves directly  yet  but are taking the opportunity to watch, listen, and follow. Make a **Charisma** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a failure, a hostile individual or entity learns more about you, which may lead to additional hurdles or ambushes at the DM's discretion, such as the BBEG learning of an attack or new strategy. On a success, you exist just as (un)noticed as intended, and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this check may be granted for use of visible traps, alerts, or guards that reduce your apparent vulnerability. ##Positive consequences Perfect awakening Sometimes a creature rises from a sleep so perfectly in sync with their body and refreshed that not a hint of grottiness remains. Make a **Wisdom** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, your wakefulness doubles your initiative bonus for the next 24 hours. On a failure, the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of additional comforting aid, such as a bedroll, or sleeping potion. A suitable partner may or may not help in this way too, at DM's discretion. Hearty meal When a meal is cooked just right, with the perfect ingredients for the right situation, it is fulfilling and restoring. Make a **Constitution** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you regain all hit dice at the end of the rest. On a failure, the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of substantially higher quality supplies than the living conditions would suggest, being in particular favor of the most influential deity for the local area, or being catered to by a close friend or family member. Clarity of mind Sleep and trances can lead to the inspiration that empowers greatness. Whether due to dreams of the future, divine inspiration, or just the power of one's mind working during a good night, fortune favors the rested. Make an **Intelligence** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you gain inspiration, and may regain inspiration at the start of the next 2 short rests. This cannot increase your total inspiration stored beyond ordinary limits (usually 1 use). On a failure, the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of mentally inspiring resources, such as expensive tomes, divination rituals, or offerings to a chosen deity or pantheon. Rapid recovery Good rests can cure ills and issues in ways usually only reserved for magic. This night may be one such curative time. Make a **Constitution** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you experience the effects of the Lesser Restoration spell, or if you beat the DC by 10 or more, you may choose to instead benefit from the effects of the Greater Restoration spell. On a failure, the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for use of healing or curative potions and material during or immediately prior to the rest, such as in a hospital ward. Interact with host A place to rest is not just about sleep and food. Most good shelter is provided by an individual or entity, and they are often worth speaking to. Make a **Charisma** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you become more well acquainted with the host during the night, and they become friendly or allied to you, if not already. On a failure, the host's demeanour doesn't change, and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for the use of appropriate attire or conversation topics to build rapport with the host. Refer to their character traits. New lead Times of rest can lead to chance discoveries, from overhearing a critical conversation, to noticing a key passage in a book. Make an **Intelligence** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you pick up a new hint, lead, or other bit of supporting information to help you on an active goal. On a failure, nothing new is gleaned and the rest completes normally. Advantage on this save may be granted for expending additional resources to support local conversation, or for the use of mentally inspiring resources such as expensive tomes, divination rituals, or offerings to a chosen deity or pantheon. Fellow guest Few places of rest are just you and the host. If not in the same establishment, others rest and recover in the local area that you may interact with. From time to time, they may react very positively. Make a **Charisma** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, a local or visiting NPC becomes friendly or allied to you. This may be an NPC you have encountered before, or someone entirely new. This new NPC may offer services at a discount, or have limited information they'd now be more willing to part with. Advantage on this save may be granted for expending time and resources locally to meet others resting, or performing actions that support the community. Gift or prize Not all transactions are zero sum, and sometimes you are on the receiving end of profit or charity. Perhaps a round of gambling occurs, or someone is inspired by your goal and wishes to support you. Make a **Charisma** saving throw against the consequence DC. On a success, you receive a small gift or prize  roll on the individual treasure table in the DMG to determine an appropriate value, using the highest CR of the involved NPCs, or the DM may determine a specific reward. Advantage on this save may be granted for proficiency with a gaming set, or performing actions that support the community. ------------ The aim for this piece is to put greater emphasis into properly preparing for a night's rest. Notably, increased living standards should lead to reduced negatives and enhanced positives. Additionally, each night should have only a modest chance of something actually occurring, and avoiding failure cascades in all but extreme scenarios. By design then, all living conditions have a built in chance of nothing (not just the 20% chance of nothing from a roll of 9-12, but also the empty slots on some lines, and the lack of any consequence on a save result that opposes the scenario, pass for bad and fail for good). In the main, DCs are set such that better conditions means better chances of a more positive/less negative result. I personally feel it is crucial to have sufficient positives and negatives in all cases, because sometimes things just need to go right/wrong for everyone. Where living conditions won't affect the chance of the situation, but rather the class of it, the DC is static. For example, any host can be friendly - paying out for better conditions leads to a likely more wealthy and influential friend. Similarly after a point, better security just demands a better class of attacker. The scenarios and consequences are vague enough to apply to all settings, and by design any consequence that the DM deems inappropriate can be treated as a roll of ""nothing"". Lastly, tips on how to achieve advantage in situations expands options for player agency, and adds further to the idea of expending/acquiring resources to avoid incurring negatives/avoid missing out on positives. Nothing makes a random encounter table feel alive to a player than being able to actively interact with it. Ability score balance: STR 0, DEX 0, CON 5, INT 2, WIS 2, CHA 5, ANY 2. Not ideal, but then I felt that anything dex/str would be a stretch. Thoughts welcome."

Now its a bit difficult to do it in the 5e system but willing to try. Obviously the game uses vulnerability and immunity so could do that with damage type like fire or ranged etc. Shadow of Mordor also has an enraged or scared mechanic which I was thinking enraged would be they take half damage for a round and gets to make an extra attack and then scared would be the frightened condition for a round.

146,vulnerability,DnD,A good way to retire PCs that keeps players from being regretful about it.,1,bwictk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/bwictk/a_good_way_to_retire_pcs_that_keeps_players_from/,2019-06-04 10:40:35,"So when I began my current campaign about two years ago it was my first time with fifth, and I hadn't run a game since 2nd (well, other editions were out, I just preferred 2nd because I was stubborn. Anyway, when I started I allowed them to do some things I would not have done had I known exactly how overpowered it would get at higher levels... without giving examples on a specific basis, I wanted to play a non-standard-races campaign and I chose to let them pick monster manual entries to make into characters, provided that they werent absurdly overpowered, generally humanoid, etc... especially if the race in question was traditionally evil, as alignment-change towards 'redemption' has been a major theme of the campaign. My players love their characters and they love the story we've built together, but with my original mistakes in being too permissive and allowing too many intrinsic monster-race abilities to stack in ways they should not have with PC Class abilities), well, I also have a habit of rewarding my players far too much with magical items; I've spoken to the players for whom the items cause too many balance issues and am working with them on that issue, but what else can I do? I've thought of an idea, and I wanted to run it by you guys. I'll get to the endgame of this campaign quickly, but rather than having them start a new campaign with the same characters, I want it to go one of two ways: The final battle versus the BBEG takes a major toll on the characters, causing some permanent changes involving different ability scores per character, or perhaps providing other flaws such as vulnerability to certain kinds of damage, disadvantage on certain types of saving throws, or something along those likes... advantage to this is that they'd get to play the characters they have grown to love over two years, but the disadvantage is that I would essentially be nerfing their characters for the sake of balance (and there's no way it could be universally equitable as some of the characters are FAR more OP than some others...). The second idea is that their current players could currently exist within the world as prominent adventurers exactly as they were when they left off the current campaign's Big Bad, but that the players would start over with more standard, lower-level characters (likely starting between levels 3 and 6). On occasions when the party encountered the original characters, I would allow the original player to at the very least do the roleplaying for that character, and perhaps even accompany the players alongside for a quest (provided the quest included encounters that the lower-level CURRENT players did not have the experience and gear to survive on their own). Which of those two ideas is better? and... anyone have any other ideas as to how I can remove the imbalance? I'm in open dialogue with each player already and we have several ideas, but I don't want to just arbitrarily remove or destroy their items, either..."
147,vulnerability,DnD,We accidentally made the most wargamey party Ive ever seen and vaporized our DMs final encounter,47,bi1jy4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/bi1jy4/we_accidentally_made_the_most_wargamey_party_ive/,2019-04-28 03:43:19,"So Im a forever DM who got to finally play a few months back in a level 12 one-shot that one of my players volunteered to run. I, realizing I probably wouldnt get a chance like this again any time soon and being the powergaming piece of shit that I am, decided to play an aasimar Sorcadin. My fellow party members ended up consisting of a bard, a Druid/barbarian, a cleric, and a sorcerer. This sounds like a mostly squishy team, I know, but my AC was brutally high, our Druid/barb was circle of the moon and totally all about abusing elemental form wildshapes + rage to shrug off practically any damage, and of course literally everyone in the party could cast healing magic. So the one-shot starts out pretty crazy, we all wake up without any of our memories on a spaceship, our DM has surprised us with not a fantasy setting but a sci-fi one which ended up being super cool. The plot of the one-shot ended up being that we had to search the ship, which we quickly found was abandoned and try to figure out who we were, how we got there, that kind of thing. The whole time there was the eerie feeling that something was watching us, something was lying in wait to strike. As we explored we found blood remains in the ship as well as signs of a struggle and people having to evacuate quickly. The air of suspense was excellent, especially for a relatively new DM. Eventually, the party was split and the sorcerer of our group ended up interacting with some sort of ancient alien creature. This lead to a deal forming between the two as they combined their forms and quickly turned on us, leading to the boss fight of the one shot being against our former party member. This is where I realized that while our DM had done a fantastic job organizing the scenario we were all in, creating a powerful creepy atmosphere, he had in fact made a mistake that I and a lot of other DMs do or did on their first times running the game. He had set us up with only one encounter and only one enemy in that encounter for the entire session. This is where we find out that four high level casters who feel free to burn all their resources at once can do some pretty stupid stuff. The first turn we all set up our buffs. I activated my aasimar ability radiant soul for extra damage, as well as prepared the spell searing smite at level 5 (the max level I could), getting ready to let loose a nuke of an attack on my next turn. Our Druid however, set up a debuff on the sorcerer that I was only familiar with in passing, Contagion. Contagion is an interesting spell with a lot of interesting different effects it can have. The one in particular she used was flesh rot. This effect gives the target disadvantage on charisma checks and vulnerability to ALL damage. Not only that, but as long as you succeed with a melee spell attack to afflict a creature with this, they have to endure the effects for at least three turns according to how the spell works, and of course she lands it no problem on the enemy. Next up was the cleric, who drops goddamn hold person on the sorcerer, paralyzing her and taking her out of the equation for at least a turn as the sorcerer fails her save. Finally, the bard throws down a bardic inspiration to my character and then casts invisibility on herself to avoid any damage the sorcerer my throw out after breaking out of the hold person spell. The sorcerer attempts the wisdom save and fails, practically sealing her fate. Top of the round, my turn. The DM gave each character a magic item of their choice and I quickly let loose two attacks with mine, a modified flametongue longsword that dealt radiant instead of fire damage. First attack, miss, even with advantage Id rolled poorly. Fortunately high level bards have d10 inspiration dice so I threw one of those down and that was enough to beat the sorcerers AC. My other attack was a quickened booming blade, which managed to strike true. I dropped a level 4 divine smite on both and my level 5 searing smite had triggered on the first hit. At this point you get the picture of what kind of insane nova damage this team could provide. Unfortunately I dont recall the exact numbers that I got that first turn, but if we do the math the dice look like this: 2d8+10 for the base longsword, 2d6 for the flametongue variant, 2d8 for the booming blade, 10d8 for both divine smites, 5d6 for the level 5 searing smite, and +12 radiant damage from my radiant soul ability. THEN you double the dice for automatic critical hit from hold person to get a total 28d8+14d6+22 for an average of an insane 176 damage. THEN you apply the vulnerability to all damage from contagion for a monstrous average 352 goddamn damage. Safe to say the fight was rather trivialized by that amount of damage output. Our dm hadnt completely underprepared for the power that 4 decently high level characters could pick and so our enemy had enough health to keep fighting after that, but it was a losing battle with that amount of dpr pressure. We felt a little bad afterwards and Im probably a terrible player for having pieced together such a power combo but at the very least it was just a one shot, kind of the only appropriate time to try something like that really. In a normal game Id almost certainly play something a lot more roleplay oriented. So what do you guys think, on a scale of 1-10 how scummy was I with this? Why did I make such a stupidly long post that no ones gonna read? What are some of your guys best insane damage stories?"
148,vulnerability,DnD,Game Tales: How our Paladin did 158 damage in one swing.,23,bl5fo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/bl5fo6/game_tales_how_our_paladin_did_158_damage_in_one/,2019-05-06 10:51:59,"So I just got back from my game and I had to tell this story. Long story short our party is in a tough fight with a beefed up Hezrou and a couple of lesser demons and some beefed up broodguards. The fight is going alright and I (Cleric: Grave domain) have a decision to make. I'm already concentrating on Ray of Enfeeblement on the Hezrou which has drawn the ire of pretty much every broodguard. I've decided the Hezrou is the unquestioned primary target and with our Paladin locked in one on one combat anyway to help him was going to be the plan. So I used my path to the grave ability to curse the Hezrou so the next damage done to it the Hezrou would be vulnerable. Next up was our Paladin who has to make a con save at the start of his turn, of course he fails and it poisoned so now he's got to try and hit this thing with disadvantage. I look at the player and go, ""no big deal just roll two natural 20's"". He rolls..... I see the first die is a 20 and all I can think is ""my God, I can't believe he got 1"" (this player is very unlucky with rolls historically). By the time my eyes make it to the second dice I literally could not believe what I saw, a second natural 20. I don't know what the odds are but my God it was one of the sickest things I've ever seen. Of course he unloaded divine smite on the fiend as well and it was just a metric fuck ton of damage. tl;dr Paladin rolled two natural 20's with disadvantage to critical with divine smite and vulnerability due to path to the grave."

Unfortunately, most of the cursed items in the DMG (there are actually very few) tend to just do the opposite of what you expect the item to do (like armor that actually gives you vulnerability to damage, or a Bag of Holding that just consumes whatever you put in it). &amp;#x200B; What I'd like to do instead is give them items that are still useful \_despite\_ the curse. Ideally, the curses would be a small tradeoff or risk that is worth making to gain the benefits, or even just a temporary humorous RP-centric effect.

These spells count as sorcerer spells for you. You also gain an expanded spell list, see circle of land druid (underdark.) **Venomous Transformation** Beginning at 1st level, you gain spider climbing, websense, and Webwalker traits. **Webslinger** Beginning at 6th level, As a bonus action you attach a vine to an unoccupied space within 30ft, you can then pull yourself forward to that space, this movement does provoke attack of opportunity. The range of this ability increases at level 12 to 60ft. **Beasts of the Dark** Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability to call forth skittering creatures of darkness to harass your foes. As a bonus action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to magically summon 3 spiders of the underdark to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The spiders use the Giant Spider statistics (see the Monster Manual or appendix C in the Players Handbook), with the following changes. The spiders size Medium, not Large.

On their turn, they can move only toward their target by the most direct route, and they can use their action only to attack their target. The spiders can make opportunity attacks, but only against its target. Additionally, while the spiders are within 5 feet of the target, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against any spell you cast. The spiders disappear if they are reduced to 0 hit points, if their target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes. **Arachnid Form** As an action, you can spend 5 sorcerer points to surround yourself with dense webs causing you to be protected from incoming damage. At the beginning of your next turn you emerge from the cocoon with Arachnid features. You gain 50 temporary Hitpoints When you cast a spell that does poison damage you can add your charisma modifier to the damage roll. As an action on subsequent turns you can attempt to trap a target with your web. Ranged Weapon Attack: use your spell attack bonus to make an attack roll, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a Strength check where the DC is equal to your spellsave DC bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage)."
155,vulnerability,DnD,Cold iron and silvered weapons,5,b8x6ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/b8x6ch/cold_iron_and_silvered_weapons/,2019-04-03 23:14:29,"So, I've been using cold iron and silvered weapons before, both as DM and player, and like these non-magical substitutes that allow for magic weapons to be given later in the adventure without dooming the fighters to be worthless in certain fights. But, now that I'm DMing a new campaign with a player that will use and buy these weapons fairly early to be used tactically, I feel that what little I can find on the topic will not suffice. So I'm homebrewing around it. The reason for this thread is me asking you, dear Redditers, to pitch in and give your 2 cents. Help me improve and round out my system by spotting any flaws it may have or by telling me your experience with these weapons. And if you find this useful or will use it yourself, great! &amp;#x200B; **Obtaining:** Alchemic silver can be made by town mages, artificers and alchemists, preferably NPC ones. It's a closely protected secret by guilds, PCs may learn it but the DM may just as easily nope revealing the recipe. In adventures, alchemist-foes may leave three vials with chemicals behind that an alchemist or town mage can mix together during the weapon forging. This can negate up to 100gp of the costs, determined by a d100 with everything below 50 as if rolling 50. Cold iron is rare but not too rare. It is available to be purchased on the free market in most places, though delivery and on-hand availability may vary. Embargos may make the material twice as expensive due to smuggling, at DM's digression. It can be gathered or looted from various places, though of course stealing graveyard barbed wire which you cannot just melt into an ingot will not fly with most blacksmiths. Similar cost reduction as silvered. Adamantium can only be bought from the likes of Deurgar and Drow, surface-dwellers that have small reserves of the material are almost as rare as ones willing to sell their adamantium. Quest-wise you may find a meteor somewhere, whether where it crashed or as someone's priced possession. This is very rare however, getting adamantium will be no easy feat. Due to the rarity of the material, only drow, duergar and a select few dwarves will know how to blacksmith the material, providing the adamantine will decrease costs by at most 200gp decided by a d100+100. &amp;#x200B; **Commissioning:** Commissioning requires a good but not mastercrafting blacksmith, and due to the vastly different process of smithing this cannot be combined with other blacksmithing. (As opposed to how historically a blacksmith would work on batches of 20-50 swords at once rather than one sword at a time.) In general: a city's best blacksmith or average dwarven or elven country blacksmith. Going on the official 5e description, any weapon costs 100gp to be silvered or cold iron'd, contrary to also official 5e that it costs 50gp per pound of weapon. As a normal weapon takes about a week to make and the blacksmith needs to be a good one earning 1gp a day, the 3 weeks\*1gp make the weapon cost at least 120gp. Without good bartering, friendly relationships or if the blacksmith's busy, opening bid is 150gp. More for bigger weapons like the greatsword; 150gp starting with a 200gp bid. The costs of the alchemist's time for silvering is already included in these prices. Adamantium costs 500gp, so add +400gp to previously mentioned amounts. \-For magical weapons, the costs are increased by 2000gp. Cold iron cannot be combined with anything related to or dealing fire, lightning or radiant. Silvered cannot be combined with anything related to or dealing acid, poison or necrotic damage. Adamantium cannot be combined with anything dealing psychic, force or cold damage. \-Adding any special metal to a long-ranged weapon is pointless, only enhanced ammunition counts. \-A weapon cannot stack silvered, cold iron and adamantium. Silvered and adamantium require tons of heat to produce reducing the cold iron to regular iron, and the adamantium will destroy the silvered coating in a matter of minutes. Besides, it's not as if carrying capacity and switching weapons is that big of a deal. &amp;#x200B; **Their use:** \-Cold iron weapons deal an additional 1d4 damage on fey, undead and fiends when it hits, as well as negating their non-magical weapon resistance if specifically mentioned to be negated by cold iron. F.e. against wrights cold iron still deals an additional 1d4 damage not cut in half, but the base weapon attack is still with resistance. \-Cold iron armour grants advantage on spells and spell-like abilities cast by Fey, Undead, and Demons. In addition, attacks with physical contact against the wearer deal 1d4 damage (as if from a magic weapon) to the attacker. This applies to all fiends. Only metal armor (and studded leather) and metal shields may be guilt or edged in cold iron. \-In the event of a cold iron shield (but no armour), 1d4 defense damage is only dealt when the attacker's to hit is one below or matched by the PC's AC rating. I don't think I'll apply similar rules to account for no cold iron shield, magical +AC etc. \-Cold iron barriers require a DC15 Con to cross for fey, undead and demons, and casting spells through these barriers is with disadvantage. This has to be a continuous barrier in their direct path. A wire counts, but caltrops don't: They instead deal damage as if a weapon. When it's obscured by anything except zircon or thin glass, the barrier has no effect. The effect extends up to a foot, meaning that a tripwire can stop an unaware affected being in its tracks, but once observed many can jump over it. Some hovering creatures will find themselves completely stopped by it. It takes proper fences to completely stop most, though. \-Silvered weapons and armour do the same as cold iron weapons, but against shapeshifters, undead and fiends. The armour's spell protection only works against devils. \-Adamantium weapons deal critical damage upon every hit against non-living items, including golems but not undead. it also deals 1d4 extra damage to celestials and ignore their resistance against non-magical weapons. These guys are part of the general 'screwing with these kind of creature' spells such as magic circle and forbiddance, so I find it logical to add them for the deep-earth and cold space metal. \-Contact with the metal will have an effect of damage on any affected being. Living and undead beings get a rash when touching it, but won't take 1d4 damage unless attacking or touching it for 6 seconds of more. Adamantium on any brittle or metal objects will create a sensation of vibration, and over time small cracks will appear on the item. Supple materials such as leather aren't affected, and direct contact is needed. \-These effects are not negated by antimagic fields, even if the weapon is magical. &amp;#x200B; \-(Optional) any undead or fiend not specified to be more vulnerable to cold iron or silvered is vulnerable to cold iron when they're chaotic aligned while lawful ones are vulnerable to silvered weapons. Also, any innately chaotic or lawful extraplanar creature is similarly more vulnerable to one of these two weapons. *or* \-(Optional) any undead or fiend that has innate shapeshifting, an incorporeal state or sunlight sensitivity (or all of the above) is vulnerable to silvered weapons. Others not already specified are vulnerable to cold iron instead. \-(Optional) anyone under a shapeshifting spell is also subjected to the 1d4 damage and the negating (but not vulnerability) of physical damage immunities. Even a human using alter self takes 1d4 damage, this damage stops but doesn't retroactively disappear when they assume their real form. (With exception of polymorph and shapeshift, whose beast hp pools are separate.) (Or, if you want to negate the druid's infinite wildshaping, they do keep the damage ;) For creatures like werewolves, their humanoid form of birth does not take additional damage."
156,vulnerability,DnD,My first-ever campaign turns 1 year old tomorrow. AMA!,3,bakmhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/bakmhc/my_firstever_campaign_turns_1_year_old_tomorrow/,2019-04-08 06:19:04,"Hi! A little hard to believe, but the first campaign I've ever run is still going strong 364 days later. It's survived over half of the players leaving at once, changes in work schedules, graduations, finals, and even the 8-month long internship I'm in half a state away from the players. Huge thanks to everyone who's played in my game and especially to those playing right now for sticking with it and with me, the crazy GM. A little about the campaign: * Fifth Edition D&amp;D, face-to-face * Low-magic, dark fantasy, grey-area morality, exploration focus, open-ended * Completely homebrew world. 12th century North &amp; East Europe, plausible medieval tone (for the most part) * Only races present are humans and a blend of all the stereotypical medium Tolkien races (dwarves, elves, humans, orcs) called urac, along with half-urac. Urac are not native to the planet, and as such are resistant to all magic, but cannot cast spells either. Half-urac have limited magic resistance but can cast spells. Both face a small amount of prejudice. * Magic of all kinds is outlawed due to a recent (20 years ago) coup attempt by the caster guilds and schools against the crown * The gods are extremely powerful beings that reside on the Ethereal Plane (quite different from vanilla D&amp;D) or other planes that draw their power from worship received; they are not necessarily immortal and are nuanced * Campaign started at level 1, the party is currently at level 7 * Party consists of a human GOO Blade Warlock (the last OG party member), an urac Long Death Monk/Grave Cleric, a human Storm Oath (homebrew subclass) paladin, a half-urac Horizon Walker Ranger, and a human Tempest Cleric * We have played 18 sessions over 12 months, averaging 3 sessions every 2 months Some helpful things I've learned so far: * Don't try to run a homebrew setting every week if you have a lot of other commitments, you'll burn out really fast. Try to find someone else who wants to run their own campaign (might be one of your players) and alternate weeks with them so both of you can GM, play, and have two weeks to prep. * If you want to try running a game for the first time, run a one-shot! Super low commitment, no lasting hard feelings if things go terribly wrong, and tons of great experience. * Be flexible with your setting. If a player wants to do something that runs contrary to your world, have a discussion. Would it unbalance anything? Would it ruin the plausibility and immersion of your world? Is it possible that your setting *does* allow for that under certain circumstances? etc. At the same time, know your setting and what makes it special; don't change those things about it. * Pick a day to run your game and commit to it. Run your game unless the circumstances absolutely don't allow for it (you are out of town for a face-to-face game, etc.). Even if you feel you've under-prepared, you'll probably be able to improvise enough to finish out the session. Players usually take much longer to go through things than you predict. * Always give hints, clues, or alerts that the players can pick up on when something bad might happen. This gives them adequate time and opportunity to change their course of action if they so desire. If you plan on throwing a trap or cursed item at the party, make sure to give them ample warning (2 - 3 hints) with signs that they can interpret to mean ""Danger"". What they do after that is on them. * If a player wants to do something that will end in catastrophe, ask them, ""Are you sure?"" This both signals to them out-of-game that something is up and slows down their impulse so their rational thought can catch up. * If you use experience points instead of milestone leveling, give all members of the party the same XP amount. This reduces headache with trying to track individual XP history (awful, trust me) and prevents inter-party conflict or competition for XP. Also, everyone levels up at the same time. * Write down your creatures' stats somewhere, even ones in the Monster Manual. Writing helps you remember details, and transcribing forces you to read the entire stat block, so you won't accidentally skip over the line about the creature's vulnerability to fire damage. I keep all of my creatures on 3x5 blank index cards and only bring the ones I think I might need for that session. * Have your players roll their d20 and their damage dice together for attacks. Even if it's only a few seconds that you save, it will add up over the hours of time that combat takes and help speed it up a little bit. This is all just my two cents, take it or leave it. It's not objectively correct, but I've found it to be useful and hopefully you will too."

To avoid shilling, I'll not mention any name. While I was learning from my mistakes in my first year of DMing, I noticed a few things that I don't find many DMs mention in their suggestions, tips and tricks for burgeoning DMs. &amp;#x200B; Thank your players. &amp;#x200B; You are learning, and they know that. They are there trusting you, hopefully, every step of the way. And, most of the time, they get this next-to supernatural level of patience with you. You're going to stumble, you're going to falter, and you may piss off a friend or two along the way, once or twice. But, if they keep coming back, if they give you feedback when you ask for it...thank them. Seriously, it's because of your players that you will be growing. Not because of the reddit conversations you read, not because you know the DMG from cover to cover, it's because of your players. &amp;#x200B; So, tomorrow night, Friday night, 8PM EST, 6PM EST, or whenever you hold your weekly games, start the session by thanking your players. If you are sincere and genuine with your players and make it a two-way street, they will take it to heart, be more invested with your game because they will feel loyalty towards \*you\*. As a DM, you are essentially a leader. So, instill loyalty. &amp;#x200B; My first year was chock full of mistakes and changes and retconning from me. But my group would take a deep breath, point out my mistakes, and I grew from them. Now, we are at the climax of my 1+ year long campaign and they are heavily invest and I came a long way. &amp;#x200B; What I'm so excited to do, is once this campaign/chapter/arch ends, I bought them all a dice set with colors that I feel that match their PCs in my campaign. It's a thank you. And once the next campaign/chapter/arch starts, they have a fresh set of dice that are attached to their first adventure with me, attached to their characters. &amp;#x200B; It's a small gesture. I don't have the funds to commission a drawn group illustration. But, it's my way to say ""thank you for putting up with my learning, mistakes, and bullshit"". &amp;#x200B; So, to all the players out there, from us DMs...thank you. Thank you so so so much for your patience and making us more confident, comfortable with our vulnerability in creativity and for fanning the flames in our bellies to come back, week after week. We will butt heads, we have butt heads, but that doesn't make us appreciate you any less. &amp;#x200B; Thank you and roll for initiative, &amp;#x200B; Your Dungeon Master"

The type of insect varies from hive to hive, sort of like Aarakocra are always different kinds of birds, but become more beetle-like as they age. They worship the Elder Beetles, the oldest of them that collectively ascended to something like godhood and live in a caste system where more beetle-like and flying insects are above the crawlers. The Carapacian is the swarm, not the host, which always speaks in ""we"" not ""I."" Carapacians trend towards neutrality, but each hive is a nation, and their views vary as much as the views of nations do. # Racial Bonuses: Swarm: The main feature is the swarm. Hive men can break off HP into swarms that have the stats of the insect swarm from the monster manual, except they mace HP=to the amount given up and a stealth modifier of +11-HP. This was meant to be a cost/benefit but the high stealth ended up meaning he just always sends one and gets perfect recon every time, so you may wanna mess with it. We have a lot of intrigue elements in our campaign and his perfect reconnaissance is breaking it in ways I have to write around. At level 5, half your health can go to flying insects. Your character doesnt canonically know what the insects learned and doesnt regain the health until they get back. * **Annexation:** allows the insects to take over a dead, sleeping, or bound npc with HP= the swarm you put in. You name it and it becomes a friendly NPC controlled by the DM * **Bolstering:** which is eating an extra portion of food to get the bugs to breed. +5 temporary HP and a disadvantage on charisma checks for 12 hours * I**nsect Bile:** a daily insect bile with a range of 40 feet. Its either acidic or healing (player choice) for 1d8 * **Sleeping in shifts**: Hive men can treat a long rest like a short rest to keep watch for all of it. &amp;#x200B; The character itself is the insects, not the husk and as such gets speak with insects, has resistance to piercing and vulnerability to fire. The insects are unaffected by healing potions and spells used on the husk and have to breed at replacement rates while resting, and can only do so if fed. &amp;#x200B; I think thats everything. Its a broken race, as Ive said to others, so edit it as you see fit. That said its been a fun addition and I recommend it!"

I can easily have 20Dex, 20 Wis, and 16/18/20 in another so a MAD build isn't out of the question. What do you think? I don't need maximum damage or would have just Sorcadined or Coffeelocked.... The fact that I could Boots of flying, cast darkness on myself (maybe ring of spell storing full of darkness), crazy high speed and disengage w/ Goblin for Monk Attack Explosion + Sneak, Cantrip, etc. then wrap it all up in a nice Assassin Crit sandwich before possibly returning to safety sounds like exactly what I'd like to play... I'm just not sure how to do it without being a very fast, very quickly swatted fly."
160,vulnerability,DnD,Vampire Player Character (add-on),2,aurart,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/aurart/vampire_player_character_addon/,2019-02-26 09:26:51,"This has been done before but I'm mid-way through Curse of Strahd and a player accepted a Dark gift to become a vampire after certain conditions were filled. I decided to do things a little differently to the book and create an add-on that any player can simply add to their character upon becoming a vampire. It probably needs a fair bit of work but this is my first draft. What do you think? \-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Vampire PC Information** You keep all the benefits of you character, if any contradictions arise as a result of becoming a vampire the information here takes priority. # Benefits  120ft Darkvision  Resistance to necrotic damage  You suffer no negative effects from not sleeping although you must still take long rests to recover hit points and spell slots  Immune to disease  You are considered an *Undead Humanoid* (arguably a drawback!)  **Bite:** As an action you may bite a grappled, sleeping or willing humanoid. You do damage equal to 1d4 + level and the humanoid makes a constitution save (DC = 10 + prof bonus). If they fail, you heal hit points equal to your level. Draining life from a humanoid can only be done to living creatures. # Drawbacks  Extreme sunlight sensitivity  You take 20 radiant damage each time you start your turn in sunlight and 20 damage the moment you are first exposed to it  Harmed by running water  You take 20 acid damage each time you start your turn in running or holy water and 20 damage the moment you are first exposed to it  Forbiddance  You cannot enter a residence without invitation from one of the occupants  Stake to the Heart  If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into your heart while you are incapacitated in you coffin, you are paralysed until the stake is removed  You must consume the blood of a living humanoid with a soul once every day or you suffer as if under the effect of exhaustion  Vulnerability to radiant damage!  You are only healed by half as much from healing spells  After each long rest make a charisma save, if you fail your alignment changes to evil. # Feats (choose one instead of an ability score improvement) **Charm**  You target a humanoid you can see within 30ft. If the target sees you they must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed. A charmed target regards you as a friend to be heeded and protected. The target isnt under your control but it takes your requests and actions in the most favourable way and lets you bite it. Each time the target takes damage it may repeat the saving throw. Otherwise the effect lasts for 24 hours, or until the target is no longer on the same plane of existence or until you die. **Children of the Night (once/day**)  You magically call 1d4 swarms of bats or swarms of rats provided the sun isnt up. While outside you can call 2d6 wolves which will arrive in 1d4 rounds and defend you for 1 hour or until you dismiss them or turn to mist. **Misty Escape**  When you drop to 0 hp outside your coffin you transform into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided you arent in running water or sunlight. If you cant transform your body is destroyed. You must reach your coffin in the next 2 hours as mist or your body is destroyed, once in your coffin you are paralysed until not on 0 hp and regain 1 hp after an hour there. *In mist form* you cant take any actions, speak or manipulate objects. You are weightless and have a flying speed of 20ft, can hover and enter another creatures space. In addition, if air can pass through a space so can you in mist form. You are immune to all non-magical damage and have advantage on Str, Dex and Con saves, although you still take damage from sunlight. **Spider Climb**  You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without having to make an ability check. **Shapechanger (once/day)**  If you are not in running water or sunlight you can use your action to transform into a Tiny bat (flying speed 30ft). Everything you are wearing transforms with you. You cannot speak but retain you Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma scores while a bat. As an action you may transform back into your humanoid form. &amp;#x200B; ***Speak to the DM about making a coffin and lair***"

I have a group of 5 adventurers, all at level 6. They are as follows: Sorcerer(Wild Magic), Warlock (Great Old One, Tome), Barbarian (Ancestral), Druid (Moon), and Rogue (Mastermind). I am pitting them up against a ""Shadow Dragon"". Here are its stats: Adult Shadow Dragon Huge Dragon, Chaotic Evil Armor Class: 19 Hit Points: 180 Speed: 40ft, fly 80ft. Str: 19 (+4) Dex: 14 (+2) Con: 21 (+5) Int: 14 (+2) Wis: 13 (+1) Cha: 17 (+3) Saving Throws: Str: +6 Dex: +5 Con: +10 Wis: +4 Cha: +4 Damage Vulnerability: Radiant Damage Immunity: Acid Damage Resistance: Cold Legendary Resistance (1/day) If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to pass it instead. Multi-attack: The dragon makes 3 attacks in a turn. Bite: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft. Hit: (2d10 + 4) piercing damage plus (1d8)acid damage. Claw: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft. Hit: (2d6+4) slashing damage. Tail: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., Hit: (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. Acid Breath: (Recharge 5-6) The dragon exhales acid in a 45-foot straight line that is 5 ft. wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On fail, take 12d6. On success, take half damage. Legendary Actions: Adult Black Dragon can take 1 legendary action, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. Adult Black Dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of their turn. Detect.The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. Tail Attack.The dragon makes a tail attack. Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. This will be the only creature they are fighting, and there will be some pillars the group can potentially destroy to outright win the fight, which they are privy to after solving a rather long puzzle. My question is thus: Did I reduce this creatures stats enough from the Adult Black Dragon to make it a feasible fight against five 6th level adventurers or should I reduce the difficulty further?"

I've been looking at the UA Mystic for a while and got to try it out the other day. First off, I can totally see how this class as-is would be abused by power gamers. Hopefully this will be addressed in future versions, perhaps by allowing one to choose fewer disciplines, but give each discipline more options (especially for higher levels; the max psi limit is 7 and you reach it at lv 9). Around 4 seems like a good number for me, 8 is way too many. I wanted my character to specialize in gathering info and stealth, so I gave him stuff like Aura Sight, Nomadic Chameleon, and Third Eye. I really liked the idea of Aura Sight's Assess Foe and View Aura (both of which allow you to see things like remaining HP, resistances, vulnerabilities, magical effects). However, once I used it and the DM read aloud HP total and resistances, it changed the mood of the game. It very much encouraged metagaming and interrupted the flow of roleplaying, and honestly it made things more boring. Does anyone have any advice on fixing or tweaking these things? My thought is to ask the DM to write these things down real fast instead of telling them to everyone, then I can choose how my character would process this info and tell the rest of the group (eg. instead of ""this thing has 143 HP"" I tell the group ""this thing looks pretty strong"" or ""this thing seems about twice as tough as that thing we fought the other day"" or ""Bob this thing is like five times stronger than you, get it together""). For Assess Foe, I kind of like the idea of reducing or removing the amount of info you get in terms of immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities. That seems like a lot to me especially when you get to higher CR creatures that have a ton of those. Maybe limit it to a choice of one? Maybe let the DM pick a single immunitity/ resistance/ vulnerability at random? Or eliminate that entirely, and just learn HP total for less psi points. As a side note, for leveling, future versions of the mystic might be improved by alternating psi limit increase and getting new disciplines. When you get both of those things at the same time, it's a lot of new features you have access to at once. Alternating those could make it easier to keep track of. Any advice is greatly appreciated! I've included the specifics of the two mentioned abilities below for reference. Also, I'd love to hear any experiences you've had with these abilities or mystics in general. \--- **Assess Foe (2 psi).** As a bonus action, you analyze the aura of one creature you see. You learn its current hit point total and all its immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities. **View Aura (3 psi; conc., 1 hr.).** As an action, you study one creatures aura. Until your concentration ends, while you can see the target, you learn if its under the effect of any magical or psionic effects, its current hit point total, and its basic emotional state. While this effect lasts, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma checks you make against it. &amp;#x200B;"

You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the damage, you gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts. My question comes to the ruling of if the ice is broken before your turn are you free of the ice. Obviously if you don't take all the damage you're still encased in which case you lose your next turn because it isn't until the end of your turn that the ice melts. But if the ice takes its full hp in damage are you then set free from the ice? "

In it, I've included a section in which the characters can meet a small group of Lycans (Weretigers) and, with just the right action, will have the ability to receive the curse. I started looking through the books for as much information as I could on a viable way to create a sort of secondary character subclass but there was nothing to really be found. It made me decide to make my own homebrew. At first glance, I feel like this build is sort of broken (as the players may keep their race and class. This is just added on) but after considering that they could permanently lose their character, receive no EXP benefits while in lycan form, and permanently have a flaw that can cause harm to them should somebody find out, it seems like it got evened out. Tell me what you guys think and let me know if I should change anything. Thanks! Here it is (sorry for the length): &amp;#x200B; Curse of the Weretiger: Players bitten by a Weretiger must succeed on a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or receive the Curse of the Weretiger. Players may forgo this saving throw in order to receive the affliction. Only humanoid character races may obtain this strand of lycanthropy. A player who becomes a weretiger forsakes any lycanthropy afflictions previously bestowed. In this case, a player may succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to retain their prior affliction. Any player who is undead or was previously resurrected from the dead when cursed with lycanthropy must roll a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be eviscerated, destroying the player permanently and damaging their alignment if a suitable host is found for their soul (to the DMs discretion). During any Stage of the affliction, if a player is to receive -5 Beasthood (Beasthood and Bloodlust will forgo EXP gained at any point), he/she loses control and becomes a hostile permanent Weretiger who is controlled by the DM. MARKED: Roll a d6. The corresponding body part receives a large, noticable blackened mark to signify the curse: \[1: Left or right forearm 2: Left or right hand and wrist 3. Neck (jawline to clavicle) 4. Left or right shin 5. Left or right thigh 6: Chest or back\] Multiattack: As an action, you can make two attacks while in lycan form: one with your bite and one with your claws. You are proficient with both. Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: reach 5 ft., finesse one target. Hit: (1d8 + STR) piercing damage. At higher levels: this attacks damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). Claws: Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., finesse, one creature. Hit: (2d4 + STR) slashing damage. At higher levels: this attacks damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (3d4), 11th level (4d4), and 17th level (5d4). FLAW: Recieve the flaw Creature of the Night. If a non-ally learned of my affliction, I would be treated as a monster. &amp;#x200B; Players also receive the boons/flaws associated with their stage of lycanthropy. Stage 1: Transformation into a weretiger is involuntary, triggered by such things as seeing full moon or blood moon, seeing silver, smelling humanoid carcasses, becoming enraged, and having your HP reduced below 3 times your player level (Example: A lvl 3 character below 9 health will begin their transformation. 3x lvl 3=9 HP).These will force a player to begin transformation. (DM may decide on specifications.) A successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw can prevent the transformation from ocurring. For each successful saving throw, difficulty of the saving throw increases by 5 (example: a player who successfully made a DC 10 Constitution saving throw will have to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the next time the lycanthropy is triggered). If a player fails, they must Transform and receive -1 Bloodlust. A player may willingly forgo their saving throw and allow the transformation to take over. When triggered, the player must cast Transform (Weretiger) on themself. Players may only return to their humanoid form after satiating 5 Bloodlust before dawn. Players who do so successfully gain +1 Beasthood. 1 Bloodlust is gained by killing 1 humanoid creature. If the player fails to satiate 5 Bloodlust before dawn, he/she is automatically returned to humanoid form at dawn, removing 1 Beasthood and gaining +2 exhaustion for 8 hours. Regardless of the player's willingness to Transform, they must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become feral after the transformation. While feral, the player will attack any creature, friend or foe, nearest to them if in combat. If outside of combat, the player instead runs in the opposite direction of a civilization for 1d4 hours. The DM may roll to determine if the player becomes violent or not. The player has no recollection of anything that happened while a Stage 1 Weretiger. In addition, players receive the following: \-While Stage 1 afflicted: FLAW: Gain the flaw Aggression. I am easily prone to aggressive outbursts. People who betray or berate me cause me to get mad. While mad, I have no sympathy for the catalyst person and may even fight or say something I will later regret. This can enduce my beastly nature if left unchecked. FLAW: Gain the flaw Carnivore. I can only eat raw meat. Anything else makes me sick. FLAW: Gain the flaw Severe Beasthood. Your character loses proficiency in persuasion if he/she has it. You also receive disadvantage in persuasion checks due to your affliction. BOON: Gain the feature Beastlike Nature. You gain advantage in intimidation checks due to your beastlike nature. FLAW: Health is reduced by 10. \-While Stage 1 transformed: Player appears as a medium humanoid, vaguely resembling their former self. Thin fur covers their body, their pupils slant, eyes become yellow, orange, or green (whatever is closest to their natural color), small claws protrude from their fingertips, and a tail extends from their back. Any non-magical clothing is destroyed in the process but armor and weapons are absorbed or dropped on the ground. \+15 Temp HP You are unable to wield weapons or cast spells. You cannot speak but understand all languages known prior to transforming. Natural Armor: 14 AC Vulnerable to silvered weapons: Silvered weapons deal double damage. Vulnerable to magic: Magical attacks deal double damage. Keen Hearing and Smell: You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Feast: Outside of combat, a transformed player may choose to spend 10 minutes in order to eat a humanoid corpse and gain +5 temp HP. &amp;#x200B; Stage 2: Players who have gained 5 Beasthood progress to Stage 2 Lycanthropy and Beasthood is reset. All Stage 1 boons and flaws are removed and replaced with the following Stage 2 flaws and boons. Full Moon or Blood Moon will trigger involuntary Stage 2 Lycanthropy. The player has no recollection of anything that happened while in involuntary Stage 2 Lycanthropy. A successful DC 10 Constitution saving throw can prevent the transformation from ocurring. For each successful saving throw, difficulty of the saving throw increases by 5 (example: a player who successfully made a DC 10 Constitution saving throw will have to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw the next time the lycanthropy is triggered). If a player fails, they must Transform and receive -1 Bloodlust. A player may willingly forgo their saving throw and allow the transformation to take over. When triggered, the player must cast Transform (Weretiger) on themself. Players may only return to their humanoid form after satiating 5 Bloodlust before dawn. Players who do so successfully gain +1 Beasthood. 1 Bloodlust is gained by killing 1 humanoid character. If the player fails to satiate 5 Bloodlust before dawn, he/she is automatically returned to humanoid form at dawn, removing 1 Beasthood and gaining +2 exhaustion for 8 hours. Shapechanger: The afflicted can use its action to Transform into a tiger-humanoid hybrid, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed but, rather, dropped on the ground or absorbed into the player. It reverts to its true form if it dies or each day at dawn. \-While Stage 2 afflicted: Keen Hearing and Smell: You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. FLAW: Gain the flaw Beasthood. Your character loses proficiency in persuasion if he/she has it. FLAW: Gain the flaw Carnivore. I can only eat raw meat. Anything else makes me sick. BOON: Gain the feature Hightened Beastlike Nature. Your character gains proficiency in intimidation if he/she does not have it. You also gain advantage in intimidation checks due to your beastlike nature. \-While Stage 2 transformed: Player appears as a large humanoid, vaguely resembling their former self. Fur covers their body, their pupils slant, eyes become yellow, orange, or green (whatever is closest to their natural color), claws protrude from their fingertips, and a tail extends from their back. \+15 Temp HP Natural Armor: 16 AC Speed increase by +15.

Feast: Outside of combat, a transformed player may choose to spend 10 minutes in order to eat a humanoid corpse and gain +5 temp HP. &amp;#x200B; Stage 3: Players who have gained 10 Stage 2 Beasthood progress to Stage 3 Lycanthropy. All Stage 2 boons and flaws are reset and the player gains the ability to Transform at will (Boon of the Weretiger). \-While in Stage 3 affliction: BOON: Gain the feature Hightened Beastlike Nature. Your character gains proficiency in intimidation if he/she does not have it. You also gain advantage in intimidation checks due to your beastlike nature. Speed increase by +10 Keen Hearing and Smell: You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Immunity to poisons/diseases BOON: Health increased by 10. Boon of the Weretiger: a player may use a bonus action to cast Transform on his/herself to change into a medium or large humanoid-tiger hybrid, change into a tiger, or revert to his/her original form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than those specified below, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing falls to the ground or is absorbed within the player. While Stage 3 transformed: \+15 Temp HP Natural Armor: 18 AC You are unable to wield weapons or cast spells. Vulnerable to silvered weapons: Silvered weapons deal double damage. Damage Immunities: Bludgeoning, Piercing, And Slashing Damage From Nonmagical Weapons That Aren't Silvered Keen Hearing and Smell: You advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Feast: A transformed player may choose to spend 10 minutes in order to eat a humanoid corpse and gain +5 temp HP. Devour: As an action, a transformed player may choose to use their turn in order devour 1 humanoid carcass and gain +5 temp HP. A player must perform a short/long rest before they are able to cast Devour again. &amp;#x200B; Stage 4: Players who have gained 20 Stage 3 Beasthood progress to Stage 4 lycanthropy. Retain all Stage 3 boons and flaws. Stage 4 lycanthropy also receives the following: Once per tenday, while in lycan form, the afflicted character may choose to do one of the following: Bestow Affliction or Pack Alpha. Bestow Affliction: once per tenday, when making a successful Bite attack, the afflicted player may choose to force the opposing humanoid creature to make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw or receive Curse of the Weretiger. Bestow Affliction may also be used as a ritual (1 hour cast time) on one willing humanoid creature. Pack Alpha: once per tenday, when making a successful Bite attack, the afflicted player may choose to force the opposing humanoid creature to make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or receive Mark of the Thrall. Mark of the Thrall acts as Curse of the Weretiger. However, once a humanoid creature transforms into a lycan for the first time, they are unable to revert to their original humanoid form without a Greater Restoration, Dispell Curse, or Wish spell. The new lycan also acts as an allied NPC for the lycan who bestowed the mark. Players who use this feature are unable to control more than 5 lycans simultaneously. The player must also provide any and all necessities to their thrall. Thralls are unable to enter most townships due to their impossing presence. Strength becomes 15 unless already higher. Devastate: Devour now has a chance to enduce fear. On success, all creatures in a 15-foot radius must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for the duration. While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends for the creature for 24 hours. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Progression: Stage 1 to Stage 2: 5 Beasthood Stage 2 to Stage 3: 10 Beasthood Stage 3 to Stage 4: 20 Beasthood &amp;#x200B; Stats: Stage 1: Flaw (Aggression), Flaw (Carnivore), Flaw (Severe Beasthood), Feat (Beastlike Nature), Flaw (Health Reduction), Transform, Natural Armor, Vulnerability (Silver), Vulnerability (Magic), Feast, Speed Increase Stage 2: Feast, Flaw (Beasthood), Flaw (Carnivore), Shapechanger, Feat (Hightened Beastlike Nature), Natural Armor, Speed Increase, Vulnerability (Silver), Vulnerability (Magic), Damage Resistance Stage 3: Feast, Feat (Hightened Beastlike Nature), Speed Increase, Immunity (Poison/ Disease), Natural Armor, Devour, Boon (Health Increase), Boon of the Weretiger, Damage Immunities, Vulnerability (Silver) Stage 4: All Stage 3, Devastate, Bestow Affliction, Pack Alpha, Boon (Strength Increase) &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; For anybody who made it to the end, I really appreciate you taking the time to read this over.

Roll down below for a pleasant surprise. &amp;#x200B; Had my players use this chart when one of their contacts told them to experiment on some ""Savages"". We ended up having a gnoll melt, another turn into a vampire, and having a Pumpkin King fall in love with our Tabaxi Rogue. &amp;#x200B; **Strange Concoctions:** 1. Meltification: DC 15 con saves or 1d6 permanent damage to all attributes. Reroll and add sixes. If the creature dies, a gibbering mouther is formed. If the con succeeds -4 to a chosen attribute. 2. Harmful Mutation: -2 to a random attribute. 3. Madness in a Jar: Gain a random Long-Term Madness. 4. Strange Mutation: Roll on the mutation chart. 5. Blackbrew Poison. DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) on a failure, half on a success. 6. Strange Mutation: Roll on the Mutation chart 7. Fountain of Youth/ Mysterious Box: The Character Rolls a d10 and loses/gains that many years. Adjust as needed for races. 8. Withering Mutation: A random Save gains disadvantage. 9. Controlled Mutation: Roll on the Mutation Chart 3 times. Select one. 10. False Flight: The character puffs up like a balloon and cannot get down. Disadvantage on Dex Rolls, vulnerability to slashing/ piercing damage. At 0 HP the individual blows up akin to the fireball spell (though piercing/acid/force damage instead of fire). They are invulnerable to blunt damage and constantly fly, though must make a dex save to move. Character deflates after 1d4 hours. Dispel magic also helps, but causes them to take 1d6 bashing damage from flying around.w 11. Revivification: The character instantly changes race and possibly sex, as per DND reincarnation rules. Pathfinder reincarnate rules can be used for varied results: Dragonborn Replaces Halfling, which is a 50/50 chance with Gnome. 12. Helpful Mutation: A random skill gains proficiency. 13.

Meal in a bottle/ Bottled Hunger: Character gains/loses 3d20 pounds. 17. Love Potion #9: The character becomes infatuated with another random character in the same room. 18. Doctor Jeckle and Mister Hyde: The character gains a split personality. This personality is the exact opposite of their normal one. This character has different ideals and thoughts from the initial character, and is aware of its existence. It secretly wishes to destroy the initial personality for a new one. 19.

Beyond just a visual reskin, I was looking at proposing a couple of changes, DM is pretty open to it but was wondering what peoples views were: 1) Potentially changing damage type from psychic to radiant to fit theme, but could make it overly powerful depending on the campaign (so far it's been a lot of goblins and beasts rather than anything with radiant vulnerability) 2) Shadow Blade gets advantage in dim light or darkness, which doesn't seem to fit if it's more radiant, so not sure what alternative would be equally as balanced?"

I shall write her stats first then her story. 18 strength, 20 dexterity, 16 constitution, 10 intelligence, 12 wisdom, 8 charisma. 19 years old, Fire genasi. Class: Bloodhunter order of lycan (Weregoat using strength of weretiger for strength boost) Setting roleplay based campaign with combat based character. First fight with kobolds, one shot all of them except one who is now my characters adopted daughter. Second fight literally 50+ zombies, 1 undead beholder. Killed 30+ of them myself beholder left for everyone else as well as remaining zombies. third fight super buffed adult red dragon. Had over 400 health because the Dm decided buffing dragon health and giving them full spell lists is cool, I agree. but still. . . I'm not allowed to complain because I did over 250+ damage to it. forth fight some dragon cult dragon borns nothing worth while same with 5th fight just a repeat. sixth fight same as last fight. seventh fight against two hydras I knocked one out and the other members got it down to low health but set the forest on fire as well, it ran away and no one chased it for a about 10 minutes. After taking care of one side myself and the wizard decided to go and find the hydra by ourselves we did. I use a calculator to add up damage I do to things. When we found it once more it had 13 heads and 500+ health can't remember exact number. (Fun fact the dm replaced it's ability to not gain heads with it takes fire damage and gave it vulnerability.) The wizard enlarged me and the Dm then said it can add an extra d12 to damage so an average turn was a 3d8+33 3d12 (3d8x2 fire) to be fair I rolled almost max damage every time for the fire damage. I ended up beating it up in four turns so the lowest I rolled on the fire was a 43 fire damage + 53 magical bludgeoning from my fists and then the highest I rolled with the 3d12 was a 36 which added to magical bludgeoning. I want to know is it fair to nerf someone that rolls super well, I now do a d6 damage instead of d8 lose 12 maximum health a turn when transformed and 1 health everytime I use my rite. Also I did not miss a single attack. &amp;#x200B;"

I was thinking the same could be cool for mundane armors. Armors in 5e basically have three properties, though they aren't named as such. One property, which I will call Noisy for the purpose of this thread, imposes disadvantage on stealth. A second, Cumbersome, defines a strength score requirement you must meet or suffer reduced speed. The last property, Light, allows you to add your Dexterity modifier to the AC set by the armor, with a cap at 2 for medium armor. &amp;#x200B; In the same vein, we could imagine armors imposing disadvantage on skills other than stealth, gold armors that make you vulnerable to lightning damage, medium armors with a 3 dex cap instead of 2, and I'm sure many other things. &amp;#x200B; I'm compiling a list with interesting ideas.

During a miniboss fight, the Bard used Faerie Fire for advantage on attacks, the Sorcerer procd Wild Magic and gave everyone vulnerability to piercing damage, and the Cleric used his channel divinity to give the next attack vulnerability to all(?) damage. The Pally then blew his full load, including 2 smites, and a crit. So he rolled 2d8(morning star crit) 1d8(pre-attack smite) 2d8(post attack smite) plus his Str. This is where I think things got messed up though. We doubled the morning star attack because of the Wild Magic surge, then doubled all of the damage dealt from the Channel Divinity. All in all 110 damage was felt from a single blow, all while being level 4. As far as I can tell, the only thing I screwed up was doubling the morning star attack twice, once from the WMS giving piercing vulnerability, and then again for the Channel Divinity giving vulnerability. Did I rule the damage right, for the most part, or did I let the player stack up way too much damage?"

A target must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. **Mind Burn (Recharge 56):** Slarkrethel magically emits psychic energy. Creatures of Slarkrethels choice within 60 feet of him must succeed on a DC 26 Intelligence saving throw or take 36 (5d10 + 9) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that fails also loses 1d4 spell slots, beginning from lower-level spell slots and working up. &amp;#x200B; ## Legendary Actions Slarkrethel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Slarkrethel regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. He can forgo using them, and he cant use them while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, Slarkrethel cant use them until after his first turn in the combat. **At-Will Spell:** Slarkrethel can cast one of his at-will spells. **Tentacle Attack or Fling:** Slarkrethel makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling. **Lightning Storm (Costs 2 Actions):** Slarkrethel uses Lightning Storm. **Ink Cloud (Costs 3 Actions):** While underwater, Slarkrethel expels an ink cloud in a 60-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than Slarkrethel. Each creature other than Slarkrethel that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of Slarkrethel's next turn. **Mind Burn (Costs 3 Actions):** Slarkrethel recharges his Mind Burn and uses it. &amp;#x200B; ## Lair Actions On initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties), Slarkrethel takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects. Slarkrethel cant do so while incapacitated or otherwise unable to take actions. If surprised, Slarkrethel cant use one until after his first turn in the combat. * **Tidal Push:** A strong current moves through Slarkrethels lair. Each creature within 60 feet of Slarkrethel must succeed on a DC 27 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from him. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from Slarkrethel. * **Lightning Rod:** Creatures in the water within 60 feet of Slarkrethel have vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next round. * **Electrogenic Shock:** The water in Slarkrethels lair becomes electrically charged. All creatures within 120 feet of Slarkrethel must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. &amp;#x200B; ## Regional Effects The region containing a krakens lair is warped by the creatures blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects: * Slarkrethel can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on his lair. The effect is identical to the *control weather* spell. * Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals cant leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (5). * Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are charmed by Slarkrethel and aggressive toward intruders in the area. When a kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately."
173,vulnerability,DnD,"[5e] After a long, almost fatal battle, several of our characters had strong emotional moments. Here is mine!",1,adrs2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/adrs2a/5e_after_a_long_almost_fatal_battle_several_of/,2019-01-08 18:12:03,"To give some background, I am currently partaking in a 5e West Marches game. Sunday (January 6th) we ventured out into a desert towards (what we assumed was) a tower. This adventuring party consisted of my character, **Artemio** (Human Variant Fighter/Barbarian), **Cricket** (Wood Elf Beastmaster Ranger), Octavius (Yuan-Ti Hexblade Warlock), **Pierce** (Scourge Aasimar Oath of Conquest Paladin, worships Bane), Veruna (College of Glamour Bard). Artemio rolled incredibly high stats (lowest was a 14s, highest was two 18s, total ability score of 94) and she is a champion of Melora. She was raised from birth to become the champion and fighting/hunting/survival/etc. is all she has ever known. Cricket was the first true friend she had made in this new part of her life. She greatly respects Octavius and Pierce for being honorable warriors in their own ways, while she is accepting of Veruna and Sebastian. To her, despite Melora's domains being the wilderness and storms, she believes that everything happens because fate wills it so. She even has a shrine to Melora in town. But this doctrine became quite the cross to bear when it came to this upcoming adventure. &amp;#x200B; The first encounter was easy, a handful of ghouls, skeletons, and zombies, with a couple death dogs and a ghast thrown in there. After a quick short rest, the party healed up and ventured into the actual tomb itself. As they entered, each party member who entered received **vulnerability to Necrotic damage**. &amp;#x200B; As they ventured below the surface of the desert and into the tomb, it funneled into a ten-foot wide hallway with stairs leading down. As party headed further in, they encountered a Bone Naga. Artemio rushed into the frey, taking the first couple of strikes and missing, with Veruna and Pierce right behind her. Octavius, Sebastian, and Cricket hung back, slinging spells or (in Octavius' case) getting in close to get the full effect of his Hexblade. &amp;#x200B; But due to some poor Perception rolls, we failed to spot the invisible Wight and Vampire-whose-skeleton-was-brought-back-to-life. &amp;#x200B; As Artemio became frightened of the Bone Naga, she was forced to run in the other direction, becoming grappled by the Vampire and receiving over 50 points of damage in a single turn, causing her to fall unconscious. Cricket and her wolf Lucy were subsequently gravely wounded and diseased by the Wight. By this time, Pierce and Veruna managed to take down the Bone Naga. Veruna made her way to the Wight and assisted in that battle as well. By this time, Sebastian had fallen unconscious due to a natural 20 by the Wight. After struggling to kill the Wight, it was eventually brought down by Cricket. &amp;#x200B; Yet the Vampire still remained. &amp;#x200B; By this time, Artemio had failed 2 death saving throws and was on the verge of death, luckily, the Vampire rolled poorly on its initiative and all of her friends got to go before it. With a quick usage of a healing potion on Artemio's person and some lucky dice rolls later, they managed to down the Vampire and save Artemio and Sebastian. &amp;#x200B; However the damage had been done. The disease inflicted upon Cricket and Lucy began to take its effect over the course of the journey. It nearly tore the party apart in an attempt to persuade Pierce to use Lay on Hands to cure the disease (might I remind you that he is an Oath of Conquest who worships **Bane**). Eventually, after haggling and a lot of persuading, he used it to heal Cricket but not her beloved Lucy. &amp;#x200B; During all this time, Artemio offered minimal assistance. She was in deep thought. Her doctrine of Melora being as deliberate as fate itself crumbled before her. Once they were in town, Cricket was forced to put down Lucy to end the pain because she knew she would be able to bring her back. And Artemio... broke. &amp;#x200B; Here is a snippet of what I wrote up for her solo scene: &gt;A deep anger built inside of her, but not from her belly where her rage usually came from, it came from her heart. Artemio grit her teeth and took deep breaths to quell the rage. But as she tried, the taste of blood began to build from the back of her throat, deliciously spreading to her tongue and her lips; her heart hammered against her chest and blood pumped in her ears, thundering in her head like the drumbeats of a war drum forging insatiable rhythms. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time hung in the air. Every second passed like the slowly falling dew drop on the edge of a leaf. For a moment, the beating stopped. All noise vanished. All Artemio could sense was the scent of sandalwood and vanilla incense kindling just a little ahead of her. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And then, she took the dive. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;... &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Why?! Artemio growled. Another slash. *Why?!* Another slash. Why did you nearly kill me? She tossed aside Fury and grabbed the edges of the shrine, tearing the nailed wood apart. Why did you nearly kill Cricket?! She kicked the back of the shrine in, sending the idol of Melora toppling forward. Artemio pounced on the idol and lifted it up so the sapphire eyes of the owl stared into hers. A glint of sunlight reflected out of the eyes and into Artemios. ***Why did you save me before?!*** The raging warrior spun around and threw the idol into a tree trunk, shattering it like glass and sending the pieces in a cone behind the trunk &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;She fell to her knees as exhaustion took her body, and looked down at the ground for the first time since she began meditating. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;All of the flowers, the wild grass, the vegetation around the shrine had wilted. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Artemio curled her legs into her chest and buried her forehead between her knees. The quiet sounds of weeping and sniffling echoed throughout the deathly silent forest. &amp;#x200B; If you like me to post the full thing, just let me know. &amp;#x200B; I'm sorry for the incredibly long read, but I really wanted to share this with the DnD community. This is why I play this game. This is why I love this game. This has not only affected the players, but the DM and the whole server as well. It is definitely my best moment in Dungeons and Dragons yet."

Goron: Size: Medium, standing anywhere from 4-8 feet tall. Ability score increase: STR: +1 CON: +1 1 additional point added to either stat by player choice. Rock biter: Can survive off certain rocks for food. May make survival checks anywhere, including underground, to find suitable rocks to eat. Stone flesh: Has resistance to fire damage. (May add vulnerability to thunder damage) Has advantage against any saving throws to resist petrifaction. Bulldozer As a bonus action, after taking the dash action and moving 15 ft in a straight line, you can spend the rest of your movement to ball up and roll through the space of any medium or smaller creatures on that line. Each creature which you move through the space of must make a dexterity saving throw, with the DC being 8+STR mod+proficiency bonus On a failure, the creature takes 1D4+STR MOD bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. - Thoughts?"

I was playing a Fighter/Cleric multiclass and she a Warlock. A note about this battle; there were 2 win conditions. Either you slay the other person or be the first to retrieve an item dangling from a chain above the arena. This is was the first thing that confused me becuase there was no challenge to getting the item off the chain, you just do it and win. A few rounds in a get a bunch of good hits, being a fighter, and she is fairly low I assume from her reactions. She casts some spell that deals a bunch of damage and rolls almost all ones and twos. She asks the DM to reroll arguing that her 'bed is at a weird angle' and he just agrees. 7 damage turns into 33. After dealing with that, we kept going for a few rounds and I got a few more good hits bringing her even lower. Then all of a sudden the DM threw a couple of hell hounds at us for no reason at all. She took next to no damage from them, but I was taking 16-17 points a piece + the DM gave us both magical items and I took a breastplate of Vulnerability (Slashing) so I didn't take as much from her longsword. Good thing the dogs did piercing damage and he also told the other player what the breastplate did so she would just through magic stones at me that dealt x2 damage. After getting frustrated and fairly low on HP, I decided to end it by going for the orb. Hit the chain with spiritual weapon, doesn't break. She hits the chain with eldritch blast causing it to go flying into a pile of rubble, our DM does BA cantrips so she instantly dashes over to pile. I dash over next to her, sacred flame and almost get her. Next turn she gets 28 on investigation and instantly wins the match. After all is said and done, I felt really cheated from the whole thing but was glad it was over. The DM stopped us before I left and said that she would be getting bonuses in our actual game for winning and that I would be getting punished for losing. MFW my DM is DM'ing with his secind head"

Im still working on random tables and getting them to be easily used during one the fly DMing. The effect type list on the bottom is subject to change at some point. **The Alchemist's Kit** Each alchemist's kit contains the following 5 Alchemists oil flasks 5 Alchemists smoke pellet bundles 5 Alchemists alcohol vials 5 Alchemists paste carton 15 common vitriol for alchemists acid. 15 glass vials with cork tops. Oil Burner with a potion stand ** Alchemy and Potion Making** To make potions a player must first have proficiency with an alchemist's kit. Past that one must acquire the raw materials in order to brew a specific potion. The materials are as follows: One unit of vitriol or alchemists acid One alchemist medium One container Alchemical ingredients. **Alchemical Ingredients** Alchemical ingredients are nonmagical materials that create effects when consumed raw in a specific manner, or when brewn into potions. Different magnitudes of potions can be created by changing the amount and variety of the ingredients of the same effect type. Potion Level Potion Level | Variety | Quantity ------------|--------|-------- lesser | 1 | 2 common | 2 | 3 greater | 2 | 4 masterful | 3 | 5 Ingredients fall into four separate categories. Plants, Aquatics, Insects and Morsels. Die tables can be found to create new alchemical ingredients on the bottom of the post. There are more tables for visuals but im not posting those jsut yet. Premade ingredients for in game use can be found on NEEDS PAGE Ingredients can be used in potions and can effect characters up to three days after harvesting. While fresh ingredients have a consume type specified for how the ingredient can affect a character -- alchemical ingredients that are brewn into potions will become the consume type of the medium they are stored or brewn into. Ingredients can be preserved with a container and a herbalism kit for later use. **Vitriol:** Vitriol is an alchemical substance that can be used to brew alchemists acid. Alchemists acid is the base for every potion. The acid is neutralized when it comes in contact with an equal quantity of an alchemical medium and will then be fit for ""consumption"" Vitriol is a glass like dust that can be brewed into an acid with a bit of heat and a bit of solution. **Alchemist's Mediums:** Mediums are what affects how one must consume a potion in order to feel the effects. The mediums and their effects are as follows. **Alchemist's Oil** A semi viscous oil derived from the coniferous extract of trees and plants. Alchemists Oil is blood soluble and can be used to create blood contact potions that one would rub on the blade of a sword, the tip of an arrow or anything that deals piercing or slashing damage. **Alchemist's Alcohol** A clear distilled alcohol for creating edible and drinkable potions. Highly poisonous in its raw state and extremely flammable, alchemist's alcohol is the baseline for creating the classic healing potions or the deadly poison to put into another's drink. **Alchemist's Paste** A thick waxy paste derived commonly from beeswax and alchemist's oil. Bitter to taste and poisonous if eaten alone, the waxy paste can be used to create contact inflicted potions that can be rubbed on objects or people. Poisons can now be made that will be absorbed through the skin as well as potions. **Alchemist's Smoke** Volatile white pellets that produce gas from their reaction of combustion from sudden force. Created from Alchemist's Fire and a powdered organic dye, alchemists smoke can be used to create a healing cloud for multiple distant targets or to nullify targets out of sight and behind cover with a well thrown sleeping potion. **Potion Effect Types** Water walking -- Water walking Fright -- Fear effect towards all targets at DM's Discretion Respite -- Lose a point of Exhaustion Better hearing -- heightened hearing Deafness -- loss of hearing Courage -- inability to have the Fear Debuf Darkvision -- Temporary darkvision gain Strengthen -- + temp strength Wither -- - temp strength Waterbreathing -- waterbreathing + loss of air breathing Focused Thought -- concentration cannot be broken by nonmagical means Clouded Mind -- concentration cannot be made Exhaustion -- sleep spell Paralysis -- effectivly paralized for a variable amount of time Saturation -- doesnt have to eat for a certain amount of time Feather Fall -- featherfall spell Health Regen -- health point gain Health Deminish -- health point loss Blindness -- vision diminished Invisibility -- invisibility spell / blur spell depending on level Heat Resistance -- fire resist, cold vulnerability Cold Resistance -- cold resist/ fire vulnerability Deafness -- diminished hearing Magic Sight -- magic sight spell "

I like Jarad as a character, but they really over estimated his CR and didn't make him unique enough compared to the generic devkarin lich. "

As a level 2 Druid who identifies with the ""Circle of the Moon"" druids: ""Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape"" to transform into with a Challenge Rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max.

Clearly DM will have FULL control if this chain of events could happen this early in a campaign. IE. Crag Cat seen in a parade/zoo/ Druid shape shifter they meet/ powerful person's play thing on a chain...but is it a legit win? Also, a high level character could utilize this vulnerability in the same way or with the [lvl 4 spell] polymorph; so this question still has valid use beyond the mentioned hypothetical."

The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends."" So ""the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage"" What is considered part of the attack, because the hunters mark and the smite are both triggered off the attack and are in a way a part of it. So would an enemy have vulnerability to all of that, or just the initial hit, or just the hit and the smite? The way we ruled it was that the initial hit plus the smite and hunters mark were all with vulnerability, BUT then if the paladin takes his extra attack then that second attack and everything that goes with it won't be with vulnerability &amp;#x200B; TL;DR Does Path to the Grave give vulnerability to everything that comes along with an attack or just the attack itself."

The wild magic table consists of many effects, exactly 50 of them. Every two numbers share an effect, so 1-2, 3-4, 99-00, etc. some effects are useful, harmful, or just really neither. This is a grouping of them. Useful effects. These effects can be considered a buff or benefit to your sorcerer, in order that they appear on the list. + For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. + You cast Magic Missile as a 5th-level spell. + For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. + Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw. + An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. + For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action. + You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. + Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute. + You regain 2d10 hit points. + For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. + A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to Magic Missile. + You regain your lowest-level expended spell slot. + Up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you take 4d10 lightning damage. + You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. + You can take one additional action immediately. + You cast Mirror Image. + You become invisible for the next minute. During that time, other creatures can't hear you. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell. + If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the Reincarnate spell. + Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. + You regain all spent sorcery points. This comes out to 21 positive effects possible. There are also negative, harmful effects. This section excludes effects that can be either harmful or helpful. + You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. + You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth + For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. + You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn + You cast Polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. There are 5 effects that are guaranteed to be harmful to you. This section is for any effect that can considered both harmful or helpful, either by affecting both an enemy and an ally, or effecting one or the other by chance. Yes, I am stretching the term of helpful to include ""able to deal damage to an enemy"" and by any means + A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears I minute later. + You cast Fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself. + You cast Confusion centered on yourself. + You cast Grease centered on yourself. + You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. + 1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. + You cast Levitate on yourself. + A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. + You cast Fog Cloud centered on yourself. + Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell. + A random creature within 60 feet of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours. + You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. + Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the sum of the necrotic damage dealt. + You cast Fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. + You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute. + For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame. + Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. This comes out to a total of 17 effects of mixed results There also effects that offer no weakness or benefits but rather are just silly and weird. Some of these can be argued to fit into other categories, but fit best here. + Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A Remove Curse spell can end this effect. + Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. + Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours. + Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. + You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute + For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. + You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. This ends with 7 effects in the misc category. So through these categories, there are 21 positive effects, 5 harmful effects, 17 harmful and helpful effects, and 7 neutral effects. If you plan to make your own wild magic chart, the amount of effects should roughly equal these amounts, however if you have 25 positive effects and 5 neutral effects, its not an issue until its wildly different. My personal recommendation is do not go off more than 4, assuming you make 50 effects. I hope I helped someone out "

191,vulnerability,DnD,Adult White Dragon ~ 12th-level Arctic Druid 5E,1,9udumn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9udumn/adult_white_dragon_12thlevel_arctic_druid_5e/,2018-11-06 01:17:44,"I always felt White Dragons got the short end of the stick. Not only are they the ""weakest"" of the dragons, their piss-poor charisma coupled with their ""primal"" savagery makes them too dumb to be reasonable spellcasters. Well, screw that. Wisdom is a casting stat, and the Druidic arts is as primal as they get. So, here's a template for an Adult White Dragon that is a Circle of the Land (Arctic) druid. As an Adult, it is a 12th-level, but if you wished to scale it up to Ancient, just make it an 18th-level Druid. Remember, adding class-levels adds additional Hit Die to a creature (pg. 283 DMG), so an Ancient 18th-level druid White Dragon would have (36d20 + 144) Hit Points, 522 on average, which is significantly beefier than a normal Ancient White Dragon. Keep that in mind before throwing it at your party. **Adult White Dragon - 12th level Arctic Druid** *Huge dragon, chaotic evil* **Armour Class:** 18 (natural armour) **Hit Points:** 278 (28d12 + 96) **Speed:** 40 ft., burrow 30 ft., fly 80 ft., swim 40 ft. &amp;#x200B; |**STR**|**DEX**|**CON**|**INT**|**WIS**|**CHA**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |22 (+6)|10 (+0)|22 (+6)|8 (-2)|19 (+4)|12 (+1)| **Saving Throws:** DEX +5, CON +11, WIS +9, CHA +6 **Skills:** Perception +14, Stealth +5 **Damage Immunities:** Cold; Poison + Disease (Circle of the Land Druid) **Senses:** Blindsight 60 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 24 **Languages:** Common, Draconic **Challenge:** 13 (10,000 XP) ## Traits: **Ice Walk:** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **Innate Spellcasting:** The dragons innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The dragons Innate Spells are cast at the highest Spell level which the dragon can innately cast (4th-level). The dragon can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 1/ day each: *greater invisibility* **Spellcasting:** The dragon is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It requires no material components to cast its spells. It has the following druid spells prepared: * Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft*, *mending*, *poison spray*, *shape water*, *frostbite* * 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *fog cloud*, *faerie fire*, *thunderwave* * 2nd level (3 slots): **spike growth**, **hold person**, *heat metal*, *gust of wind* * 3rd level (3 slots): **sleet storm**, **slow**, *dispel magic*, *daylight*, *water breathing* * 4th level (3 slots): **freedom of movement**, **ice storm**, *polymorph*, *locate creature*, *blight*, *wall of fire* * 5th level (2 slots): **commune with nature**, **cone of cold**, *insect plague*, *tree stride* * 6th level (1 slot): *heal*, *bones of the earth*, *investiture of flame* ## Actions: **Multiattack:** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. **Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) cold damage. **Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. **Tail:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. **Frightful Presence:** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **Cold Breath (Recharge 56):** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. ## Legendary Actions: The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. **Detect:** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check. **Tail Attack:** The dragon makes a tail attack. **Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions):** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed. **Cold Breath (Costs 3 Actions):** The dragon recharges its Cold Breath and uses it. **Cast Spell (Costs 1-3 Actions):** The dragon uses a spell slot to cast a 1^(st)\-, 2^(nd)\-, or 3^(rd)\-level spell that it has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell. ## Lair Actions: On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: * Freezing fog fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centred on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature in the fog when it appears must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the fog takes 10 (3d6) cold damage. A wind of at least 20 miles per hour disperses the fog. The fog otherwise lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies. * Jagged ice shards fall from the ceiling, striking up to three creatures underneath that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon makes one ranged attack roll (+7 to hit) against each target. On a hit, the target takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. * The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the walls space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies."

Most of the time, your backstory, and personality develop as you go along. My character Torvin, is no exception. So before we analyze him, let's dive into his backstory, and personality. **An Example of a Complex Character** Ability Scores: STR: 20 (+5) DEX: 9 (-1) CON: 14 (+2) INT: 16 (+3) WIS: 12 (+1) CHA: 12 (+1) Class: Paladin, Oath of the Conqueror (formally Oathbreaker) Alignment: Lawful Impure (formally Lawful Evil) Status: Deceased (old age, died at age 73, was age 30 when he was introduced, 33 when campaign ended) Family: Ardyn Darkblade (Wife), Emily Darkblade (Oldest daughter), Terry Darkblade (Youngest Son), Thomas Darkblade (Older Brother), Nora Darkblade (Mother), Alistair Darkblade (Father) Backstory: Torvin was born in the princedom of Meniken (pronounced Men-e-kin) in the city of Berhan (Bear-hon), he had an older brother named Thomas. When it came to politics, especially in his time; Thomas was the heir, and he was the spare. But Torvin wanted to prove he was better then Thomas, so he spent his spare time working out, and reading books. By the age of 10, Torvin was already pretty smart, and could almost tackle his father. However, later that night, when they all sat down for dinner in their castle, Torvin's father was talking politics to his brother, and when he asked Torvin what he wanted to do when he was older. Torvin said when he was older, he wanted to slay a dragon! He wanted to be known as ""Torvin, the dragon slayer!"" but his family laughed in his face, and though it was all just a joke. Torvin then left the safety and comfort of his castle and spent the next three years, living on the streets, as an urchin. Torvin, at this point, had fallen in with a bad crowd of urchins, He wasn't really as agile as the other kids, but what he lacked in speed he made up for in brawn and brains. He was the only urchin who could read, who knew what streets lead where, he knew how to muscle people for money or food. Until one day, this group of knights came into town. One of them wearing this beautiful, bejeweled cloak. Torvin and his fellow Urchin's salivated at how much food, and money they could get out of that cloak. The older urchins talked about how many Women they could get at the brothel. One of the younger urchin's lured the knight in by begging. Once distracted, Torvin and his friend snatched the cloak, but the knight noticed, and gave chase. Torvin was not the swiftest, and was eventually caught, cloak still in his hands. He was expecting to be hung for stealing from a noble, or dragged off to rot in a cell by the city guard, but the man looked down at Torvin, and said that he could be better. The man told Torvin to keep the cloak, and had offered Torvin a new life, out of the streets, and in a better, more noble life. Torvin gladly accepted. He later found out that the man was named Araldor, an aasimar. He was taken to a small chapel, about a day outside of Berhan, this was a chapel to the Silver Flame. Over the next 7 years, Torvin trained with weapons, and armor, and studied the old scrolls and testaments of the Silver Flame, going out on missions to spread the word of the Silver Flame, or putting down bands of bandits. One day, on his way back from a mission, his group was attacked. Torvin took an arrow to the thigh, his silver horse, Dust, had taken several arrows, killing him, nearly instantly. Torvin was thrown from his horse, and incapacitated, his leg broken in many places, with a broken arrow shaft still in his leg. After the bandits were killed, Torvin was dragged back to the chapel. His chapel only used healing magic when it was essential because something could go wrong. Torvin spent the next several months, bed written, unable to move. But the leg never fully healed, so every time he walks, he has a limb. One night, as Torvin was resting, his chapel was attacked, by the time he had gotten ready, it was already over. Most of the chapel's inhabitants were killed, including his savior Araldor. As Torvin surveyed the damage of his home, he noticed a tiefling, covered with blood laughing against a wall. When Torvin spoke to the tiefling, and finding out his ilk was responsible, Torvin executed him. Since then, he has *always* hated tieflings for what they have done. Torvin prayed, and prayed for guidance, for what he should do, but no light came. He prayed harder, and harder, to anyone, *anything,* to help him. Eventually, a voice spoke to him, and said that he should go to the outskirts of where the tieflings camp was. He donned his armor, and grabbed his blade, and went there. Upon arriving, he asked what to do next, and the voice said to kill them, but Torvin was in no shape to fight, and he had said that, but the voice said to him ""Fear not my dear Torvin, I shall help you."" Torvin, before he knew it, he was charging forward, and attacking the tieflings with supernatural speed, strength, and power he only dreamed of. He *lavished* in the bloodshed, and when they were lying dead at his feet, he went back to the chapel to hear the singing of his praises. But when he told his fellow brothers about, they were horrified by his actions, and expelled him from the chapel, saying that was not their ways. As Torvin left the chapel, he ripped his rosary from his neck, and let it fall into the dirt, before crushing it beneath his boot. ""*Why? Why have they done this? Did I not save them, did I not avenge them?""* Torvin cried. ""*You did.""* the voice called. ""*But I expect them to not understand, You have done well Torvin. Together, you and I can do great things.""* ""*I know.""* Torvin replied. A set of invisible hands placed themselves on Torvin's shoulders, and he swore he could see someone looking down at him. ""*Sometimes to stop evil, one must become evil.*"" The words rang in his ears. ""*Yes. it must be done!""* Torvin declared. ""If I may ask, who are you?"" ""*Asmodeus.*"" The next 12 years of Torvin's life, can only be described as the darkest points in his life. He murdered, slaughtered, and destroyed *everyone* in his wake as Asmodeus declared. When Torvin met Deslin, Altemizi, Loki, and Vishnu, he thought they were but a means to an end to help him serve Asmodeus. He enjoyed Deslin, because he was human, like himself. he admired Loki, because he was an aasimar, and despised Altemizi, because he was a tiefling, and Vishnu he was indifferent. Torvin's unwavered dedication to Asmodeus, brought him to the nine hells, where he walked through all nine hells, to get to Asmodeus himself, where he killed a Deathknight by himself, and earned himself a set of Demon Armor. But later down the line, when he realized that something terrible was about to happen to the world as he knows it, something in him changed, he later met Corren, an ancient gold dragon, who had been polymorphed by Bahamut, into her human form that she later recovered. Torvin fell in love with her, and it made him change, his heart was no longer corrupted by the urge to slaughter, maim, and murder his whole life. He had shed the cursed armor from his body, and turned his life over, though he is still tempted by his lust for power. But Torvin had abandoned Asmodeus, as this was not the life he wanted to die with. He had already died once, when fighting The Shadow, and something in that death changed him. He knew at that moment, that *this* was the dragon he was suppose to slay, *this* is what he told his parents about, that this was what he'd come storming home saying ""Mom, dad, Thomas! I killed my dragon!"" Asmodeus hadn't protected him like he said he would, and this had shaken his faith tremendously, but he was already beginning to feel Asmodeus's influence over him fading, *so maybe he was doing himself a favor?* Either way, his life changed, and he devoted himself back to The Silver Flame, something he knew would protect him. Once him and his new found friends saved the world from obliteration, he confessed his love for Corren, who rejected him. But all was not lost, instead, he chose to live the rest of his life humbly, and modestly, teaching his children, and his grand children about his legend, and how they can be better then him. So much so, that his sword ""*A New Dawn""* wasn't meant for the oldest, it was meant to inherited by the child who earns it. **Creating a Complex Character** When it comes to creating a complex character, if you look on any character sheet, it will usually have a few boxes labeled ""Personality traits, Ideals, bonds, flaws."" These are great cornerstones that build up your character's complexity. For those who struggle with creating Personality traits, ideals, bonds and flaws, there is always the books examples that add a nice flair to your character, such as bonus proficiencies, languages, and tool proficiency. I would say if you had a dual background, you should be allowed to get the benefits of each, 3 or more, you'd have to choose 2. And by this scale if we were to dumb down our exampled character Lord Torvin, he would be Noble/Urchin/Acolyte/Soldier. So before we get into nitty gritty of building a complex character lets ask ourselves this ""What is a Personality Trait, Ideal, bond, and Flaw?"" But first: *What's a Personality Trait? Or how exactly does it play into my character?* A personality trait(s), is fairly self explanatory, it's a trait, or tick that defines something about your character. This can be some sort of quirk, or behavior. For example ""I have a joke for every occasion"" or ""I'm overly optimistic."" These make the character interesting and more then just a name and an array of stats. *What are Ideals? How exactly do have or make an Ideal?* The best way that I think it can be defined as, is something that you personally believe in, such as a political leaning, a religion, or idea that defines your actions. For example ""Music is the heart and soul of all life."" or ""evil must be crushed at all costs!"" these more often then not loosely define your alignment, whether you fall inside of law, chaos, neutrality, good, or evil. *What's a bond? What does it mean to have a Bond?* Bonds are usually things that you cherish, or hold onto. This may be your unwavering love for your wife/husband, the fiery passion of revenge that you so desire from a great family tragedy, Or it might be the urge to prove your more then people know. For example ""I love my wife, and will never leave her."" or ""I will give my life for my friends."" A bond means you hold something dear to you, and is more often then not a driving force for your character, aside from your backstory. Lastly, *what's a flaw? How many flaws can my character have? Do I have to have a flaw?* Flaws are usually quirks, or traits that ground your character. Every character should have at least 1 flaw because it shows that your character is not perfect. This can range from ""I'm pessimistic"" or ""I'm quick to anger."" or ""I can't help indulging my more obscure fantasies"" to ""My loss drives me, and clouds my judgement."" If your character has flaws, it shows humility and vulnerability, something that any complex character needs. **Creating a Backstory** This is always the fun part to any character I make. When coming up with a backstory for your character, there are several things that you should keep in mind when writing it out. Firstly, you want your backstory to be long enough that it tells about your character's origins and motivations, while being short enough that there is room for more. If you have a 10 page backstory talking about how you went to the nine hells, and killed each arch devil, and over came each of their challenges to rescue person X, and all this lore and what not, and how you suffered a big tragedy that made you what you are today and you're a puny level 1 fighter with 12 hit points, you might has well have written a book about it, and not made a character. I would as a player, and writer, your backstory should be no more then 3-4 pages, if it can be read within 5-10 minutes like a campfire story, then your good. Basically, you want your backstory to be long enough that you can define your character while still having enough room for improvements and development along your adventure. When writing your backstory I can think of 5 things that you should include in your backstory. They are: Childhood, Parents, Teenage years, Defining Moment, and you end goal. Childhood and Parents are pretty straight forward, *what was your life like as a child? Who were your parents? What was your relationship with your Parents?* Your Teenage years are also fairly important too, did you get into a lot of trouble as a teen? *Did you develop any bad habits, like drinking or whoring? Were you rebellious or well mannered?* Then of course there's your defining moment, what made you abandon your old life in favor of your new one? Did you die and come back? Did you loose a love one? Or were you simply doing this for wanderlust? Your defining moment can be as dark or as happy as you want it to be, because this is what made you, *you.* This is why your fighter, or a rogue, or cleric. Lastly, your end goal. *What do you want to accomplish before you die?* *What is your ultimate goal? Revenge? Redemption, See the world?* Whatever the case, having a motivation or goal to accomplish makes your character much more real, and grounded in the world. Another thing to add to your backstory could be your birthplace, if your DM has a fleshed out world ask him about some cities, towns, or countries that he may have for your character. Or, if you want, create your own. You can be from the notorious city of Waterdeep, or something as obscure as ""The City of Glass."" being from a place makes your character all the more real. Now obviously, your character won't be as complex as Torvin right away, because my character has grown and developed over *years* of playing him. Your character might be a one-shot, or might be one you play constantly. **What makes Torvin a Complex Character?** Lets start off with his origin. He was born from a noble family, in one of the 3 major princedoms that make up the continent. He instantly had status, and royalty, and grew up comfortably. But he was constantly living in his brother's shadow, so he wanted to outshine him. Eventually he said that he wanted to slay a dragon, and because of this he left his family and threw it all behind him, in favor of perusing his dream of killing said dragon. That was his childhood, and relationship to his Parents. Then in his teenage years, he lived in the streets until one day he was rescued from himself by an Aaismar, from there he looks up to Aaismars, and when he became a man of faith, he shows unwavering support, unless he has a good reason to abandon it. This also means that because he's lived nobility, as well as poverty, he knows what it's like to be comfy and safe, and how brutal life can be. He also learns about the Gods, and their relation to the multi-verse. This adds a layer of depth to Torvin's views of world, and knows that it much bigger than he realizes. Afterwards, we find out that the people he called friends, and family, were butchered by horrible people and when he snapped, he killed all responsible for it. This tells us that Torvin has now suffered loss, he knows what it feels like to lose someone he looked up to. To feel the anger of revenge and rage and the searing hate he has for tieflings because of what they did to his chapel. This was his defining moment, this is what made him break his oath, and become an oathbreaker to Asmodeus. Lastly, over his course of adventuring, becoming a lord of a kingdom, being looked up to by thousands of people, falling in love, but having his heart broken, dying, and seeing what the end of the world will look like, forced him to change his motives and strip off the darkness that had consumed him. I had always said half Jokingly that Lord Torvin is basically ""medieval Darth Vader"" in terms of looks because he wore black plate armor that he couldn't remove without removing the curse, He had a fiery sword that did fire and necrotic damage, and as I kept playing him more and more, I began to actually see that his origin is closely related to Darth Vader, and his end too. All of the things that he had experienced in his life made him a well rounded individual. From Nobility to poverty, to faith, and rejection, to love, and loss. All of these together make him arguably one of the most complex characters ever created, because of everything that he's experienced. I hope this helps any new players out there who want to get into D&amp;D and are having trouble with making a character, or are returning players/DMs who want to try their hand at making a complex character, and don't know where to start. As I said, no character is immediately complex, each character requires multiple sessions, sometimes years to flesh them out from ""Oh, I want to adventure and see the world."" To Lord Torvin levels of complex. Just be patient, and try your best."

As the title says, I'm currently homebrewing some enemies from id Software's DOOM, since DnD was the inspiration for the first game. I have the first enemy done, which is the Imp, and I'd like some feedback on it! Info as follows. **IMP** *For how common the imp is as the front-line soldier of Hell's armies, little actual information on the imp beyond the obvious is known. Anatomical comparisons of the imp with the summoner did seem to show a relationship between the two, however, suggesting that the latter is a highly advanced form of the imp.* **CR:** 1 **HP:** 2d4+2 **Abilities:** *STR:* 8 *CON:* 14 *DEX:* 18 *INT:* 8 *WIS:* 14 *CHAR:* 2 **Saving Throws:** *STR:* \-1 *CON:* \+2 *DEX:* \+4 *INT:* \-1 *WIS:* \+2 *CHAR:* \-4 **Languages:** Infernal **Damage Resistance:** Fire **Damage Vulnerability:** Radiant **Condition Immunity:** Frightened Charmed Deafened Petrified **Actions:** *Claw* Range: 5 Attack: -1 Damage: 1d4-1 With a ghastly shriek, the imp slashes at its target with putrid claws. As a bonus action, it may retreat up to 15 feet away after attacking, or it may make a second attack. The imp may pounce up to 10 feet before using this attack, but this sacrifices the imp's ability to retreat. *Fireball* Range: 25 Attack: +2 Damage: 1d8+2 The energy of Hell surrounds the imp's hands and forms into an orb, burning all that it touches once it is thrown. The target must make a DEX save throw (DC 15). Upon a successful throw, the damage dealt by this attack is halved. This attack can be charged for up to three turns, gaining 1d4 of damage but also subtracting one per turn from the attack roll. "

It's a fun little empowered version of the regular Phase Spider (which is oodles of fun, just ask the Mighty Nein!) which I hope turns into an exciting and interesting fight. Having them hold their actions to attack the Spider when it's in-phase rather than just cutting a swath through the enemies as the fights have usually been going should spice things up. &amp;#x200B; **Lolth-Touched Phase Spider** *Large Monstrosity, neutral evil* *A phase Spider possesses the magical ability to phase in and out of the Ethereal Plane. It seems to appear out of nowhere and quickly vanishes after attacking. Its Movement on the Ethereal Plane before coming back to The Material Plane makes it seem like it can Teleport.* *This particular specimen has been Awakened by priestesses of Lolth, then empowered with the blessing of the Spider Goddess. An evil intellect now dwells within this phase Spider and it is loyal to the Drow unto death.* **Armour Class:** 14 (11 + 3) (Natural Armour) **Hit Points:** 120 (20d10+10) **Speed:** 30 ft., climb 30 ft. &amp;#x200B; |**STR**|**DEX**|**CON**|**INT**|**WIS**|**CHA**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |15 (+2)|16 (+3)|12 (+1)|10 (+0)|10 (+0)|6 (-2)| &amp;#x200B; **Saving Throws:** Strength +4, Dexterity +5, Constitution +3 **Skills:** Stealth +7 **Damage Immunities:** Poison **Condition Immunities:** Poisoned **Senses:** Blindsight 10 Ft., Darkvision 60 Ft., passive Perception 11 **Languages:** Undercommon **Challenge:** 4 (1,100 XP) &amp;#x200B; **Traits** **Legendary Resistance (3/day):** If the spider fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **Ethereal Jaunt:** As a Bonus Action, the Spider can magically shift from The Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane, or vice versa. **Awakened:** The spider has an Intelligence of 10 and can speak Undercommon. **Spider Climb:** The Spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. **Web-Sense:** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. **Web Walker:** The Spider ignores Movement restrictions caused by webbing. &amp;#x200B; **Actions** **Multiattack:** The spider can use its Web attack against a creature. The spider can then move up to its speed as a bonus action and make a Bite attack against the same target. **Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target is stable but Poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining Hit Points, and is Paralyzed while Poisoned in this way. **Web (Recharge 4-6):** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* \+5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target takes 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage and is Restrained by webbing. As an action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). &amp;#x200B; **Legendary Actions:** Can take 3 Legendary Actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. Spent legendary actions are regained at the start of each turn. **Move:** The spider moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. **Phase:** The spider uses its Ethereal Jaunt to swap between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane. **Bite (Costs 2 Actions):** The Spider makes one bite attack. &amp;#x200B; **Lair Actions:** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the spider takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the spider cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: * The spider invokes the power of Lolth, casting *web* at a point within 60 ft. of it. All creatures within that cube must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, or become Restrained. As an action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). While maintaining concentration on *web*, the spider cannot take other lair actions. * The spider invokes the power of Lolth, casting *hex* on a target of its choosing. While maintaining concentration on *hex*, the spider cannot take other lair actions. * The spiders lair completely fills with webs, covering every surface. Until initiative count 20, movement inside the lair is impeded by the webs turning everything into difficult terrain. The Spiders walking and climbing speed is doubled while moving on webs for the duration."
195,vulnerability,DnD,Community input for a 5e mechanic Ive been working on,3,9j75v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9j75v9/community_input_for_a_5e_mechanic_ive_been/,2018-09-27 08:19:47,"Ive been working on a mechanic to add for my players who are all Melee based PCs, to make combat more tactical and dynamic. I would very much appreciate all feedback about my mechanics balance and usability, but on a more personal level if it is something that you as a DM or a PC would use in your own games. Thank you very much for your inputs. - background: Im currently running an all melee focused party with not a single spell caster element. The players wanted a dark, low fantasy world with semi-realistic combat; IE critical injuries like hands being removed from a battle. and additionally, the group are tactical war game enthusiasts so strategy and tactics are a favorite of theirs. With these all melee fighters they have, the suggestions came up to make individual combat more tactical instead of moving to an enemy and taking the attack action, heres what I have so far. - Game mechanic: stances - background explanation and reasoning: on its turn a creature and move up to its speed and take one action, a bonus action if available, and a free action. With all players being melee focused, boss fights would become everyone run to the one also melee oriented boss ( low fantasy), stand there and take the attack action, which they wanted to change up. So my thinking was if one of my players can run up to its speed every round (6 seconds), they could instead use that time saved from moving to focus on their technique when they got to their opponent ( when the fighter gets within weapon range of his opponent). - stances mechanic description: if a creature forgoes using its speed (flying or running), they may instead prepare their actions better and enhance them by entering a stance. Stances are the catch all term for a combination of footwork, posturing, quick strategic thinking and specialty weapon techniques done by a creature in the heat of battle. A stances effects start when they are first entered and last until the beginning of the creatures next turn. They can only be entered if the creature has not used its speed on its turn, so the turn after the fighter or barbarian has reached the fresh ogre and the 2 combatants are ready to start slugging at each other. - Basic stances usable by all creatures including monsters: 1. Guard: in world terms, this is the P.C or monster keeping their shield up, keeping their distance ( considering 2 squares together equals 10 ft long), and focusing on being able to dodge out of the way. - + 1 to AC, + 2 to checks on being knocked prone, forcibly moved, and saving throws against ranged spell attacks. - (-2) penalty to attack rolls of all types, and hostile creatures gain +2 to checks involving spells or actions due to the stance user Focusing on defense rather than attack. 2. Heavy attack: this is the creature throwing all their weight and power into the attack. - for melee and thrown attacks add either double your Dex or Str mod to the damage. - (-3) penalty to AC from opening yourself up from putting your force into the attack. 3. Focus: instead of necessarily hitting hard, a creature focuses on hitting a particular vulnerability in their opponents defense. - +2 to attack rolls/ target suffers a (-2) penalty to saving throws. Additionally, if a critical hit is scored while in this stance, the user may Pinpoint a specific point on the target (DMs) discretion. - the damage dice roll total is cut in half rounded up ( 1d8 longsword damage is rolled, 5 is rolled, dice roll damage is now 3, add all relevant modifiers.). - conclusion: stances are meant to give tactical players additional options, possibly giving a small but critical boost while also delivering penalties to consider when weighing options. In designing these, I wanted to make them a good option to use, but not necessary for play ( as in, no one would be penalized if they did not enter a stance every turn, just swinging away would still be viable). I hope these will give all characters, not just melee focused, a tactical option during combat along with the other stances for all classes Ive made. Also, if these are decent, I may include them in a for sale home brew I will release down the line for 5e SRD so I would greatly appreciate that mindset as well in your criticism. Thank you guys again, youre the best. "

198,vulnerability,DnD,I was the enemy.,1,9lbsw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9lbsw8/i_was_the_enemy/,2018-10-04 23:17:09,"So, this is a resolution of an idea described in this post: URL TL;DR: I'm a DM with some experience, play in a game of new DM (my player). He runs a game for his friends whom I don't know. I planned to help him DMing, play as a player for a chance and create a twist by revealing in the end that I was a ghost all along and be a final boss. Wall of text inbound. TL;DR (analysis) at the bottom. Game starts. Party consists of 3rd lvl characters: halfling monk (drunken master), elven cleric (knowledge) and tiefling bard (lore). Enter my character: [Mortimer Pines](URL It might seems that I'm a big fan of Rick and Morty and Gravity Falls (which I am) but in reality name was chosen as a foreshadowing: mortimer = mort = dead, pines = pine away = waste away. He's a young, awkward, stuttering cleric of Helm, wearing deep blue robes with a golden trim. As a facade. In reality he's a grave cleric of Myrkul, charlatan, ghost, evil bastard. As he finds the group in the tavern, he offers everyone a round (doesn't drink himself because of the ""vow""). Promises that the group will be rewarded 500 gp from the church of Helm after helping in destroying Evil Artifact (tm), which is a black crystal skull. They take the bait. After some preparations in town, we venture into wilderness. I preach about the ways of Helm, stumbling in my words and being apologetic and coy at any chance. I cast Guidance at anyone who needs it on a clock, showing my virtues as a cleric. In the wilderness we find a small pond with even smaller island, deciding to investigate we send in our monk. I continue being useful by buffing him with Enhance ability so he could swim across more easily. With my ""Divine Awareness"" (Eyes of the Grave) I detect undead surrounding island in the water and warn a monk (a bit too late, but at least there's no surprise round on him). Long story short - he gets surrounded by 6 skeletons, we help blasting them across the pond healing monk at the same time (*every* caster had a healing word). Not like monk needs much help. He deals bludgeoning damage (vulnerability) with his Staff of Striking (Very Rare) which is crazy and DM admitted that it was his mistake to give it to him so early but we'll get to that later. Combat ends, journey continues. We reach our destination by nightfall - it's a tumulus. As we camp, everyone starts to eat while my character refuses, because he's ""fasting"". Have some cool RP moments, as elven cleric (a girl) tries to tease him and touch but he avoids a contact and mumbles something about ""another vow"". Everyone smirks and don't give second thought about it. Cleric and Bard keep talking in Infernal thinking that they are the only ones who know it and have a good laugh about it. Morty understands infernal as well of course. Then everyone takes turns on watch. I take first. And second. And all of them. I haven't slept, because ""tiefling was snoring too loudly"" (he was), but because everyone's watches was alternating, no one in-character caught that I went through night without sleep. Next day we enter tumulus. Cavernous tunnels go deeper. There's no sources of light, and since I can't see as well as hafling, he lights a torch. We decide our marching order and I'm going last so ""I can see everyone if healing is needed"". Dungeon is small and soon enough we stumble in a big chamber with three sarcophagi. *Of course* they want to loot them. I stay in corridor mumbling something about desecration. They open them - three shadows spring out, combat starts. ""Told you so"". With coordination and teamwork we kill the shadows as I continue healing and use my ""Burning Mark of Helm""(Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave ). Strangely enough, shadows didn't even tried to attack me. Weird. Party pokes fun of me for staying in the corridor most of the time and being a tad cowardly. Also, seeing as the last shadow was killed by monk with his staff I'm amazed. I get closer and ask if I can hold such a powerful artifact in my hands ""because I never seen one"". Monk hesitantly gives it, he suspects something is fishy. I take a staff, wink to DM, he gives me a slight nod. I describe as I'm mumbling something under my breath as I inspect the staff. I give it back. We continue. After some trudging through corridors we reach, as it seems, our destination. A wide stone door behind which is big chamber with raised platform - and there's the black skull on top of it. The rest of the room is filled with 10x10 walls in chaotic order (I specifically asked DM for this layout). Don't forget, I'm going last. As party slowly enters the chamber, monk being the first one notices something not far off from the skull, laying on the ground. It's a withered dead body of medium humanoid in a tattered blue robes with a gold trim... Hands covering my face, I begin laughing maniacally. My character closes the door behind him and turns around. As DM describes my metamorphosis from this young naive lad into translucent, horrific visage of a ghost I rip my character sheet in pieces and say now in coarse, gasping voice ""Three souls for one..."". Roll initiative! At this point I witnessed a cool representative of different people reactions: * Bard was in a bit of a shock and awe, his eyebrows went as far up as they could, he had a dumbfounded smile and only said ""Whaaaaat?"" * Monk got droopy and said ""Fuck"" * Cleric got angry and said ""I knew it!"" Combat begins. At this point I'm using straight out monster Ghost's statistics. I used my surprise round to close a door and move through multitude of walls (incorporeal movement) deeper in the chamber, breaking LOS and obscuring my exact location (I removed my token from battlefield, DM trusted me with that and I have no reason to cheat). That's why I needed those walls in a first place - to maneuver and make combat a bit more tactical. So, first thing players did is focused on a skull. Each time someone hit it within 5 ft. of it or just touched, took 1d6 necrotic damage and I regained as much. But since I was at full health it did nothing to me, so it was a good call to destroy it first. Took them a bit more spellslots to do that than needed in my opinion. Bard even used thunderwave while being right next to it (taking 1d6 necrotic) and agreed that was a stupid idea. While they were focusing on the skull, I flew above them all and used my Horrifying Visage to instill fear in them but they all succeeded (while cleric was flipping double birds at me) and were immune from then on. After that it was a game of ""Deadly hide and seek"" where they were not sure if they wanted to find me between those walls each turn. But they needed to destroy me if they wanted to leave this place alive. And soon, monk reached me and hit me with his mighty magical staff...which did nothing - it was just usual quarterstaff. The realization hit him - I somehow dispelled its properties (It's completely DM's fiat, yes, but I found a way to justify it in elegant way and not be roflstomped by lone monk due to DM's generosity). Despite losing a big source of magical damage and multitude of resistances I had, with Bard's vicious mockery (psychic) and cleric's Sacred Flame (radiant) my health began to dwindle. Time for stage two - I use Possession on the monk and he fails. During next turn he beats up bard badly and I begin to panic a bit. On cleric's turn I hint that clerics do have special ability made to combat undead and she remembers to use Turn Undead. I fail a save (all rolls in the open) and leave monk dashing outside the room through the walls. They have a minute to recuperate, drink potions, position themselves, ready their actions. Screeching I burst out of the wall, taking some more damage. At this point I decide not to use Possession anymore and never used Etherealness. But my Withering Touch packs a punch (4d6+3 necrotic) and most of them already looking rough. I have no choice - I go to cleric and with a swipe she's going down (I'm less than 5/40 HP now). She gets ressed by bard, hit from her - miss, hit from monk - miss! I down cleric one more time and after a round I'm left with one HP! Monk reaches me and finishes off with a quarterstaff swing. I disperse in air screaming the usual clich: ""Nooooooooooo...."". Session ended there. **TL;DR/summary of what I tried to achieve and what happened:** &gt;I will help DM just by my knowledge of rules. And boy I did. DM had trouble to keep together his map, monsters, descriptions, track lists as is and when players had questions I was there to answer them from my memory. Sometimes he asked me directly what was rule according to PHB and we spent almost no time searching for rules ourselves. &gt;As a player character I will roleplay my ""righteous"" character and, hopefully, show for new players that RPing is fun and shouldn't be awkward to do. Basically breaking the ice. And they did. It played well especially during camping. Even though each player was still playing themselves, at least they were in the skin of their character and stayed in first person. &gt;As a player character I will try to move a plot because I'm a questgiver but will try to abstain from being assertive, so no decisions from me - ""mask"" of a character will be shy. As it turned out, this is a big one. Before they met my character, they spent 20 minutes trying to get somewhere to eat. Instead they harassed bystanders, squabbled between themselves and did general murderhobo stuff. When I came in, I had a specific goal and since my character was interested in achieving it, I gently nudged and steered everyone in needed direction (""So, do you need to buy supplies before we go?"", ""When do you think we should go?"") &gt;As a player I have a luxury to help new players with some vague advice to decide on a course of action if they get stuck somewhere, while DM can't do that outright. Actually, it was pretty linear adventure, but at least I reminded everyone what they can do. For example use that action for Dodge or Dash at least if there's nothing else to do. To use ki points because you are the monk (yeeeeeeah...), inspiration because you are bard and channel divinity because you are cleric. Other than that I was enjoying myself watching them try to figure stuff out. &gt;As a character I will try to keep them alive until the last encounter (I need three souls sacrificed in that exact chamber, remember?) with my healing magic. So it will reduce a risk of dying from dumb decisions or bad rolls for new players. Full supporting with heals and buffs did the trick. I didn't even had to resort to my buffed Spare the Dying Cantrip or Circle of Mortality trait. &gt;As a villain revealing his true motives I will make a memorable session (I hope) and try to give them a fight they deserve. And also have fun myself, not gonna lie about that. I had fun. Can't get into other people's heads, but during final fight, despite the tension, they were still laughing and having fun. Probably because I switched between my character (""Lambs to the slaughter!"") and myself as a player trying to help defeat my character (""You can hold an action to attack me when I appear""). In the end, my ""betrayal"" went smoothly and I had a unique experience of being a character *and* a villain in a same game."
199,vulnerability,DnD,Quirky Bones: New Playable Race Idea for 5E; C&amp;C Welcome,1,9lpliw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9lpliw/quirky_bones_new_playable_race_idea_for_5e_cc/,2018-10-06 05:51:17,"My brother has always wanted to make a D&amp;D character that was straight up just a skeleton for the race. With the release of Divinity Original Sin 2, in which you can play as an undead, my brother's interest in a skelly boi option in 5E was renewed and I liked the unique challenges it would present and of course the RP would be hilarious. So I started messing around with the idea. Heres what I have so far, please give me your thoughts and constructive criticism. &amp;#x200B; Cursed Undead Remnants of a wizards experiments? Perhaps the byproduct of a Lichs death, or some sort of unfortunate contact with the Shadowfell? Regardless of the how or why, you are cursed with undeath. An abomination, a twisted mockery of life. At least that is what many will see you as. You have retained most of what makes you, well you, but your body is naught but bones, held together by your will and maintained by your spirit. You will face interesting challenges in the world of the living. How you spent life may be a mystery or irrelevant to you now, what matters is how you spend death. **Cursed Undead Traits** **Ability Score Increase** This is determined by your race in life you gain the basic ability score increases from your basic race (no subrace bonuses). **Age**. You can be thousands of years old or a freshly raised skeleton, you can pick any age that your DM agrees with you on. **Size.** Your size is medium. **Speed.** Your speed is 30 feet **Darkvision.** 60 ft **Undead Nature**: You do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or breathe to survive. **Brittle Bones**: you have vulnerability to bludgeoning damage **Minimalistic Physiology**: You have resistance to piercing and slashing damage from non-magical weapons. You are immune to bleeding effects. You have immunity to poison damage. You cannot be blinded, deafened, or put to sleep by non-magical means. **No Rest for The Wicked**: You do not need to sleep, instead you can meditate for 4 hours to gain the effects of a long rest. **Twisted Mockery of Life**: Most amongst the living will not take kindly to an undead in their midst, you would be wise to keep your true nature hidden from most. Beware of the divine energies wielded by servants of the gods because healing spells deal damage to you. Conversely necrotic damage heals you for half the damage **Boney Fingers**: For the purpose of picking locks, your fingers count as a set of thieves tools. **Disembodied**: Your bones can detach from each other and be put back together at will so long as they are within 10ft of your skull. When disassembled you can fit in a backpack and your size counts as small. When dealing with just your skull your size is considered Tiny."
200,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrew Paladin Ability Thoughts?,2,96srfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/96srfu/homebrew_paladin_ability_thoughts/,2018-08-13 08:01:08,"So, I'm working on a homebrew Paladin Oath centered around protecting the Prime Material Plane from Fiends, Fey, Celestials, Elementals, etc. (basically, extraplanar entities), and I had an idea for one of the Channel Divinities to be Impose Vulnerability, where a creature's resistances are stripped from it. Basically, the idea is that the Paladin is able to impose a weakness onto the creature by getting rid of its damage resistances, if it fails a Wisdom save, so if it is typically resistant to Fire damage, Fire is able to harm it normally. But I was wondering about the duration of it, which would be more balanced. * Until the start of your next turn, the targeted creature loses its resistances * The next attack that hits the targeted creature ignores that creature's resistances Please let me know below!"
201,vulnerability,DnD,Looking to get some critiques on relics I made for my campaign,2,98oify,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/98oify/looking_to_get_some_critiques_on_relics_i_made/,2018-08-20 09:12:20,"As a disclaimer, this will be a long post. I'm running my first DnD campaign as a DM and the general theme is the simple ""Get these relics. Stop the BBGs."" The story I've been formulating is that each of my 5 players are the chosen champions of certain deities and as the story unfolds, each will earn their ""Divine Relic"" that is an item, crafted by their god, passed between generations of champions. I won't get into too much more detail regarding the story but that's the basics. I was hoping to get some feedback regarding the relics I have developed: too powerful, too weak, boring, just right, etc. *** The idea I had was that each relic has a starting ""primary"" attribute when they are first obtained, and when all 5 are acquired the party will have to complete a quest(s) to unlock additional ""secondary"" powers hidden within the relics. Figured this would be a good way to scale up the relics as I expect the secondary attributes won't be obtained until higher player levels. *** I'll start by going through the comp of my players (all currently lvl 8) and then dive into each relic: * Oath of Vengeance Paladin * Pact of the Chain Warlock * School of Divination Wizard * Beast Master Ranger * Assassin Rogue ###Paladin relic: Holy Edict *A glistening, circular shield made of a material that holds the appearance of clear, cut crystal gilded around its circumference. A golden Triskelion appears on the face of the shield, seeming to slowly rotate around its center and granting the blessing of the god Trithereon.* * **Primary Attributes:** +1 Holy Symbol; As a reaction, you may cast Oath Shield on a creature within range [30ft] briefly granting +5 AC; Stores 1 charge; Taking damage refills charge; *Bash*. 1d6 radiant dmg * **Secondary Attributes:** *Charge.* If you move at least 20ft straight toward a target and attacks with Holy Edict, the target takes an extra 2d4 radiant dmg and must succeed a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone;***Aura of the Justicar:*** 10ft; *Liberty.* Any friendly creature that ends their turn in the aura gains 1d4 health. In combat only; *Judgement.* Hostile creatures within the aura take -1 AC; *Penance.* Melee attacks made by friendly creatures in aura do an extra 1d4 radiant dmg \**Notes*\* I made this one last which may be why it seems loaded. The idea was to facilitate the versatility my paladin enjoys playing. Only one of the aspects (Liberty, Judgement, or Penance) of the Aura can be active at a time and I would allow my paladin to change which aspect is active as a free action at the beginning of his turn. ###Warlock relic: Gallows Gauntlet *An intimidating gauntlet with an appearance of cast iron embossed with bronze designs of Nordic dragons. Faint colors dance along the black surfaces of the gauntlet like subtle flames. The wearer of this piece of armor is blessed by the god Torm.* * **Primary Attributes:** At the cost of 1d4 health, the damage type of Eldritch Blast may be changed; *Fiendish Instinct.* Dealing damage to a creature will reveal a single vulnerability if it has any. Can only be used on a creature once * **Secondary Attributes:** *Blood Fusion.* Fuse with your imp familiar to become an **Erinyes** for 1 minute or until the Erinyes drops to 0hp. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. You may fuse more before resting at the cost of (half Warlock lvl rounded up)d8 health. If doing so drops you to 0hp, you will still transform but will be immediately unconscious after the transformation expires. \**Notes** The idea behind this item was to play into my warlock's backstory that leans heavily on self-sacrifice. I hope I articulated what this item can do. My warlock likes EB and his familiar. EB is already super powerful so I used the health cost as a way to create some balance. Same thing for the Blood Fusion; he will have to roll a number of d8s equal to half his Warlock lvl rounded up for every subsequent fusion after two. With the Fiend as his patron, he usually has a decent amount of temp health. Fiendish Instinct I recently added but I haven't introduced it yet. I feel like this one might need work since its really the only relic that has a cost. ###Wizard relic: Cosmic Lens *A crystal ball slightly larger than a human skull that levitates above its owner's hand. Within the ball is a scene of millions of stars against the black void. Looking closely, one will see several eyes open and shut within the starry space. The god Savras is watching.* * **Primary Attributes:** +2 to Spellcasting * **Secondary Attributes:** *Arcane Savant.* Gain **Sculpt Spells**; May reroll 1 Divination dice with choice; *Wellspring.* After a long rest, roll 1d8+1. You may cast a free wizard spell of your choice at the level indicated by this roll. This option resets at the start of a long rest \**Notes** This one has been tricky. I gave this to my wizard before I really knew where I was going with the story which is why the primary attribute is only a bonus to spellcasting. Seeing as wizard's can be so versatile, it hasn't seemed to be much of an issue. With the secondary attributes, I wanted to sort of make up for my lack of creativity. My wizard based his character off of Red Priests in Game of Thrones so he generally uses a mixture of divination and fire spells. Wellspring has the chance of being really fun and potentially game breaking since Wish is a thing. I'm quite interested to see what kind of feedback this one gets. ###Ranger relic: Autumn Tempest? Twilight's Mercy? *A tangle of mossy tree roots and vines, entwined around a unicorn horn that forms an ornate bracer. Spores from within the organic weave give the armor a faint glow. A wearer with the blessing of the goddess Meilikki can compel the growth of a vicious throwing glaive to defend their forest home.* * **Primary Attributes:** +2 to Ranged Attack rolls; 1d8+2 piercing dmg; *Swift talon.* At the equal cost of your available movement, the direction of the projectile may be changed or its range increased. 2-dimensions only; *Unicorn horn.* +1 to Melee Attack rolls; 1d8 piercing dmg * **Secondary Attributes:** *Fetch.* Commanding your beast companion to catch the glaive transforms it into an **Elemental** of your choice for 1 hour. After this ability is used, it cannot be used again until after finishing a short or long rest \**Notes** I know the secondary feature seems a bit cheesy but my ranger went through a long decision-making process when choosing her archetype. She also often talks about wanting to use her wolf companion more frequently as he generally just sits on the sideline in combat. I don't care much more keeping track of ammo for my ranger so the fact that she can effectively grow infinite ammo doesn't bother me. I do implement cover since I have so many ranged players so the primary feature is my way of giving her the opportunity to circumvent that if she chooses. For example, redirecting the path of the glaive by 10ft would cost her 10ft of movement. Also I haven't decided on a name for this item and am open to suggestions. ###Rogue relic: Night Angel *A katana with a perfect edge and a blade as black as night. With a habaki and tsuba that glow like moonlight, it is as if the goddess Celaena crafted this deadly sword from the shadows themselves.* * **Primary Attributes:** 1d12 slashing dmg; Light; Finesse; *Sharp Shadow.* This blade is able to conjure a shadow tanto; 1d6 piercing dmg * **Secondary Attributes:** +1 to Initiative; +2 to hit; *BAMF!* Throwing the shadow tanto [20/60] allows you to use **Cunning Action** to teleport to the location of the tanto on a hit \**Notes** Fans of Sanderson might get the reference here. I also made up a goddess for this one. My rogue likes to take risks for the sake of getting high burst dmg in combat. Even if it is in the middle of an encounter, I've allowed her to utilize the auto-crit on the Assassinate skill if she can successfully justify how she surprises an enemy and can succeed on her rolls. My hope was that the teleportation feature will help her get creative. I may restrict it to encounters only. --- So that's what I have come up with so far. I would love to hear the feedback on these items. Like I said, my players are all currently Lvl 8 and two of them still need to obtain their relics. I suspect by the time they are ready to complete the quest that will unlock the secondary attributes, they will all be around Lvl 12-13. Most of players are also new to DnD which sometimes leads them to falling back on similar tactics in puzzles and encounters. I'm hoping that these relics will encourage some creative problem solving when the situations present themselves. **Thank you to everyone who provides critiques/comments!** "

Their leader is half-elf, half-drow, and he wants to grant other drows immortality and get rid of sunlight vulnerability. During the day, elves rule the country, during the night, drow hunters hunts for resistance. There are rumours of abductions and experiments on population. What kind of activities could they perform to achieve this goal? I've been thinking to make it in ""Infinity Stones"" style, where there are powerful artifacts of some kind and gathering them all will grant you any kind of power but I fear it may get overused if players get their hands on them. Also, it's going to be multilayered, long, open campaign so the plot is rather loose. One part of the plot is to hunt down the resistance but this is just a small goal for the elven leader."

Thanks! One of my players has contracted the curse of a Werewolf, and has become a lycanthrope. He want to fight of the curse, and since he's a monk, I want to give him a chance. I'd like your feedback on the idea below: # Lycanthropy - Werewolf ## Basic Effects Strenght score increases to 15. **Resistance**: non-silvered, nonmagical Bludgeoning, Piercing and Slashing damage. **Vulnerability**: Silvered weapons **Silver Sensitivity:** Can't stand anything made from silver or silvered. Will shy away from it. (Wisdom save to maintain contact on DM's discretion). **Predator Taste:** Prepared meats no longer wet your appetite, you prefere raw meats. ## Shapechanger: **Action**: kan in hybrid of full wolf veranderen: str 15, con 14 (tenzij main stats hoger zijn). You cannot use weapons as a Wolf, and drop all items in your hands. As a Wolf, your size is Large. In **Hybrid** or **Wolf** shape: **Unarmored:** \+1 AC to unarmored **Multiattack:** You can make 1 bite and 1 claw attack in hybrid, or 1 bite and 2 claw attacks in wolf. **Bite attack:** Str based attack, 1d8+str piercing damage, DC 8+str+prof Con save for lycanthropy. **Claw attack:** Str based attack, 2d4+str slashing damage. (2 attacks in wolf shape) **Keen Senses**: Hearing &amp; Smell **Communicate with Wolves**: You can speak with other wolves in your wolf form, and have advantage on all animal handling checks on wolves in your hybrid form. **Monk-abilities:** While in Hybrid shape, you can use Monk-abilities, but natural weapons do not count as monk-weapons. Using your Ki-based abilities cost you an additional Ki-point. ## Cursed Creature **Sudden Transformation**: DM's discretion. Transform in a hybrid or wolf shape after taking damage (Wis save DC 10 or damage taken.) Can also occur when startled, or threatened. **Hunger of the Full Moon**: During a Full Moon, you are compelled to take your Hybrid shape, but can also choose to go into a full wolf as well. During the full moon (duks till dawn), you must make a DC 18 Wisdom Saving Throw, or succumb to your animal instincts, attacking and eating the nearest source meat. This can be an ally, enemy or any other living creature. **Alpha loyalty**: The pack-leader who gave you the Curse (Count Belmont), is slain by Alfredo. You hold Alfredo at a higher esteem, as you are loyal to the Alpha leader of the group. "

Similar to the ranger, though where the ranger gets minor boosts against chosen enemies, the DH gets massive ones, but also suffers penalties against others. This high degree of specialization also means that the subclasses will be drastically different, with few shared abilities. # Fantasy idea A mix of rogue/monk and warlock, with a twist where the warlock makes a pact with something for his power, a demon hunter subdues and consumes a powerful fiend (or maybe even celestial), which affects it's subclass. # Legend: **(C) -** Base class abilities. **Chaos damage type** \- Counts as every type of damage for the purpose of overcoming resistances and exploiting vulnerability. **Mundane** \- Everything that's not magical or unnatural at all.

They carve out small, idyllic grottoes filled with beautiful trees and flowers; oftentimes choosing places with a large amount of fey creatures. There they lounge in the sun, tend to their gardens, and enjoy themselves. If they do possess houses or structures these are usually only used to protect themselves from heavy rains and storms, or to avoid dangerous animals. Since many of these grottoes are led by powerful sprigling druids or are protected by fairies, these concerns are often a nonissue; leading many of the grottoes to seem simply like naturally occurring clearings (in forests) or stands of trees (in places like meadows,) rather than the dwelling place of a civilized race. Those that have had to fend off outside invaders, however, will often have barriers of wood or stone, as well as weapons; things that are very uncommon in most sprigling grottoes. # Encroaching Invaders Due to a sprigling's deep connection to plants and nature, they find the intrusion of other races to be a mild nuisance at best, and an abhorrent slaughter at worst. They work with the land to get what few things they need, causing as little damage as possible; when encountering outsiders, spriglings are usually appalled by the way they treat the surrounding land. Sprigling grottoes will usually try to warn the intruders away using any magical abilities they have or their fairy companions as threats if they don't possess weapons and other defenses, while the more well armed grottoes may either fight defensively, or simply attempt to wipe the intruders out. Depending on the nature and strength of the invaders, they may either leave the grotto alone, abandoning it to the spriglings, or they may simply kill and/or enslave all the spriglings (as best they can) and move on. Those that simply try to ignore or work around the grotto tend to run into trouble, as the spriglings, made aware of their presence, will constantly be attempting to make them leave; in some cases trying to wipe them out before they can do more damage to their home. # Spriglings in the Outside World While most spriglings live away from people in their wooded grottoes, many have ventured outside of their homelands. Some of them went willingly, driven by wanderlust or simple curiosity to see what else the world had to offer; however, many spriglings were forced to leave due to the destruction or loss of their home. Some had their grottoes attacked; those that survived either fled, were spared, or were enslaved. Others may have ended up becoming lost, either getting tricked by malevolent fairies or simply wandering too far into an unfamiliar area. However, most of the spriglings who live in the outside world are the descendants of these previous individuals, and many have fit in quite well in the wider world. While almost all feel at least a small connection to plants and to nature, you may come across the odd sprigling living in the heart of a metropolitan city. Many act as farmers, gardeners, or landscapers; while others use their intriguing and delicate appearance to great success as exotic dancers or escorts. And, sadly, in areas where slavery is legal you can find a few captured spriglings hanging on the arms of rich and powerful masters; in most places spriglings are praised by slave owners for their rarity and exoticism, and are shown off as trophies. # Sprigling Traits ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1. ***Age.*** Spriglings are naturally long-lived.

(its a little long sorry) **Spirit tomes** These innocuous tomes are imbued with ancient magics to give them life and intelligence. These tomes can be innocuous, or flashy, and often have their own ambitions. Some wish to corrupt, others to collect stories, others to share stories. Whatever the reason, these tomes wander the world, rarely with anyone knowing. In many cases, the enchanter decided what the book wishes to do, though sometimes, in rare cases. the book decides or even becomes sentient just by being in the presence of intense magic for a long time. **Magical projection:** Many books that become powerful enough learn to project tangible forms into the real world. As a bonus action you may project yourself into the world as you wish. This form is medium in size and acts as a regular humanoid, though you may choose how it appears each time you manifest it. The projection shares a health and speed with your book form. The projection carries all your equipment and can be maintained indefinitely, however, should your projection be more than half a mile away from your book, it will become hard to maintain and vanish after a minute. **Ability score improvement:** \+2 to intelligence +1 to wisdom **Age:** these books can theoretically last thousands of years without wear and tear.

At level 3, you may choose 1 1st level spell to learn. You may cast this spell once per day or using spell slots granted by your class.

Once per day you may force a creature that is reading you to make a wisdom saving throw (this Dc is 8+proficiency +intelligence). Should this creature fail the saving throw you may choose one of the following effects. This effect lasts for 1 hour. The creature must have been reading for at least 1  minutes for you to do this.**Story charmed:** For the next hour, the creature is charmed by you. While charmed in this way, the creature will be completely under your influence. Anything you tell it it will take as true and you have advantage on any charisma checks you make with the target. The creature will refuse to let you leave its side and will do most anything you tell it to as long as that action is not clearly harmful. You may dispel this effect on your choice. At the end of the hour you may attempt to reinstate this effect. The creature must make a wisdom saving throw. If it rolls a 1, the effect is refreshed and the save dc for reinstating the effect moves up to two, adding one to the dc each time the effect is reinstated. Should the creature be under your effect for more than twelve hours, this effect lasts indefinitely.**Deep slumber:** You may choose to put the creature asleep for 1 hour. The creature will not awaken by natural means unless you allow it. Magical means such as dispel magic and remove curse can remove this effect. While the creature is asleep you have limited influence over its dreams, choosing whether they be peaceful or nightmarish and being able to communicate simple messages with the creature. **Languages:** You may speak read and write in common and two other languages of your choice. **Paper thin:** you have vulnerability to fire, acid, and lightning damage. You have resistance to necrotic, and poison damage. Please give feedback if you end up using it!"

Since in the world this is a big deal, I tried to go all out with the power, taking a storm giant as a template, and then giving it a full set of magical gear, including a minor artifact, as well as feats and class features. The problem I'm having now is I'm not sure how high a CR should I estimate this creature to be, in order to point the party on the chamber's direction when the time is right (this guy is supposed to be able to take any dragon head on, at the very least).

I'm having a problem with designing and balancing the weapons of the gods of my universe. I was just wondering if anyone would be able to help me with balancing the current weapons my party has and to design the rest of the next weapon the party will get. Here are the weapons I already have: Gitons Grimoire  Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement by a spellcaster) Action Identify a spell previously casted between rounds that the user saw cast can be cast for free if you can cast a spell of that level, d6 roll to see if this ability can be used again, 1-4 not until next dawn. Intelligence increases by 2, to a max of 24 While attuned, you are blinded when you are more than 10 feet from the grimoire Enhanced Preparation. You study the grimoire while you are preparing your spells, you can prepare an additional 5 spells from the Wizard spell list that are of a level you can cast. Enhanced Spell Capacity. You gain an additional spell slot of any level of 5th or lower for which you already have spell slots. You regain these extra spell slots when you take a short or long rest. Tree of Agasis  A gargantuan tree in the Feywild that is a direct connection to Agasis guarded by the Solar Nanael. The weapon is taking a strand of bark from this tree that will be imbued into an item of choice. Wondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)  Conjure Nature Ally: You may summon one fey, beast, or plant of a CR of half your level rounded down, once between long rests. You can use a free action to give the creature a command, and if not commanded they will do whatever is in their nature.  Fey Charm: The item also has the functions of a Staff of Charming. Beasts and plants have disadvantage on the saving throw against being charmed.  Regeneration of the Ancients: Every turn in combat so long as you are not at 0 HP you will regain 1d6 HP at the end of your turn. Outside of combat the process is slowed to 1d6 every hour.  Once a day, if the item has not been used the nature-based magic in it erupts casting a random spell. Randomly one of the spells from the list below is casted from the item. At the beginning of each day you DM roll 1d4 and based on the time of the day (1 being 12am-6am, 2 being 6am-12pm, 3 being 12pm-6pm, and 4 being 6pm-12pm) that is when the magics must be used by to make sure this random spell does not cast. o Spell list:  Cure Wounds (1)  Entangle (2)  Fog Cloud (3)  Speak with Animals (4)  Spike Growth (5)  Enhance Ability (6)  Gust of Wind (7)  Hold Person (8)  Call Lightning (9)  Conjure Animals (10)  Plant Growth (11)  Polymorph (12) The Soul of the Grim Reaper  Wonderous Item, Artifact Knowledge of the Reaper  Using your bonus action on your turn you can discern how close to death a creature is (How many HP it has left) Track the near Death  You can track creatures you have brought close to death to finish the job. You have advantage on Survival checks to track a creature that you have attack and is below half its total number of HP. If the creature is within 100 feet of you, you see the shape of the figure though most surfaces, i.e. walls, floors, ceiling, trees, etc. Marked for Death  Once a day you may use this ability as a free action to give one creature vulnerability to any damage to you do it in your next turn. This overcomes any resistances or invulnerabilities the creature might have to any damage you deal to it. Embrace the Reaper  At the cost of how much damage you want this ability to do, you can use this to allow the Grim Reaper to take control of your body. The Grim Reaper cannot miss attacks and will do an amount of damage equal to the number of hit points you gave up to use this ability. The Grim cannot feel pain and will not consider your HP but will attack anyone you designate. It remains in control for 1 minute or until you take control back. Meet your Fate  If you die you cannot be resurrected. Here is the next weapon they are going to get and I need some help with design: The Every Changing Weapon - Wonderous Item, Artifact +3 Weapon Using a bonus action you can change this item into any weapon from the weapons page of the PHB.

I recently made a homebrew race since a player asked if she could play ""a small ent"" and have been soliciting feedback over the last few days, so hit me with you best shots :D Names are placeholders and also translated from German, so forgive any wonkyness. Due to the translation some things might come out wrong, I'll do my best to edit this post to fix stuff. If you happen to like this race during any point of the process of streamlining it here, feel free to use it ;) Let's get to it Sapling of the Everwoods: **Ability Score increase**: Your Constitution score increases by 1. Your Wisdom score increases by 2. **Age**: Saplings are long lived creatures. They reach adulthood at about 20 years. Nobody knows how old they can get, but at about 500 years they tend to wander into the woods and live among the trees, until they are wholly overgrown. **Alignment**: Saplings tend to be of neutral alignment. If the land they spring from is corrupted or otherwise different than it's natural state would be this may reflect in the alignment of Saplings hailing from that part of the world. **Size**: Saplings are between 7 and 8 feet tall and even the smallest ones are imposing figures. Their size is medium. **Speed**: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. **Force of Nature**: You know the *Druidcraft* cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you gain the 1st level spell *Goodberry*. At 5th level you can cast *Entangle*. You can use these spells once per day and need to complete a long rest for them to be available again. The spellcasting ability for these spells is Wisdom. **Vulnerability to Fire**: You take double damage from Fire. **Photosynthesis**: You don't need to eat or drink. While you have the ability to consume and process solid food, you may as well draw nutrients from fertile ground. To do so you must stay rooted in fertile soil for one hour during a long or short rest. Exposure to direct sunlight can speed this process up, so only half an hour of rest is required to feed yourself. **Hard exterior**: When you are not wearing armor your AC is 8+your CON-modifier+your STR-modifier. Your unarmed strikes deal 1D4+your STR-modifier of bludgeoning damage **Languages**: You are proficient in spoken and written Common, Sylvan and a third language, usually the language most commonly spoken in the land you hail from. Let's make this a fun choice for players to pick, everyone and again, thanks for any constructive feedback in advance. And if anyone actually uses this in their game, feel free to drop me a line about how it plays and what, if any, tweaks were necessary to get it working the way you intended it to."

For example, he is immune to poison, charm, and fear. But radiant is not effective against him. really the only downside is sunlight sensitivity, which does not really matter because everyone has darkvision, and needing to eat raw flesh once a day. That sounds like a big restraint, needing raw flesh, but the upside of being able to eat raw flesh outweighs that. If he kills one kobald, which is thirty pounds of meat, then he has food for roughly 5 days (Also unrelated but he has an ac of 20 as well). So what i am looking for is some extra limitation or weakness i can give him, just so that he is balanced. Something along the lines of ""you recover health at a slower rate"" or ""you have vulnerability to radiant damage"". And if you think i am being unfair, then please let me know in the comments."

Hear now the tale of our fall, and let it serve as a warning to those who would do dumb fucking shit on the basis of minimal evidence. I'm about 99% sure that the campaign we've been playing is Storm King's Thunder, but we've been avoiding sourcebooks to avoid spoilers (Please don't spoil in the comments!). An important element of what happened was the absence of three of our six regular players, and our normal method of handling this by giving control of the missing PCs to the players who were present. On this particular day, the DMs older sister Skyped in as well to play a guest party member and an NPC. It was set to be a fun session. The party consisted of: **Moot**, a Devotion Paladin, and the closest thing we had to a leader. Took the Inspiring Leader feat to protect the party. It wasnt enough. **Garth (controlled by Moot's player)**, a satirically edgy rogue who only talked in Christian Bale's Batman voice. Recently joined after the player's bard died. **Duquesne** (pronounced due-CANE), a wholesome Vengeance Paladin who served the god of death. **Barry fucking Bonds**, the greatest baseball player who ever lived, the heart of our party and our MVP. His player built him as a Berserker Barbarian who used steroids in the place of rages. **Controlled by Duquesnes player.** **Eish** (me), a Celestial Warlock and archaeologist with a stick up his ass. **Alena (controlled by me)**, a Beastmaster Ranger. (DMs sister) Friendly Goliath Cleric with a thick Russian accent. **Harshnag** (controlled by DMs sister), an NPC Frost Giant who played a major role in the quest line. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The scene was set in the foyer of the Eye of the Allfather, a temple to the giant god that we hoped would hold the answer to the disasters befalling the realm. In the center of the room were six statues, one of each type of giant (Hill, Stone, Frost, Fire, Cloud, and Storm), surrounding one greater statue which pointed at an archway filled with stone. Around the edges of that archway were six runes, again, one for each type of giant, in the same order from left to right. Vaguely relevant detail  these runes were in the order of the giants caste system, from lowest to highest. Since the archway was filled with stone, we proceeded to fuck around with the statues and runes to try to find a way through. Eventually we tried touching one of the runes on the arch and reading its name to see what would happen. The first one was the Hill rune, which lit up briefly and dropped a Confusion spell on the party. We concluded that we were touching the runes out of order, and should instead go from highest to lowest. This was followed by the party fleeing the room for several minutes as a Storm of Vengeance rained down after we touched the Storm rune. Important context for this scene: my warlock had been having a recurring dream where he passed through the archway. In this dream, **all of the runes were lit**. We came up with the following conjecture: the runes had been triggering spells because we only activated one at a time. To open the gate, we concluded that **we needed to touch all of them**. Now, we were aware of the risks, and to mitigate this, we had the two paladins (the only players besides me who were actually present) wait outside with Lay on Hands at the ready. In retrospect, this was hilariously insufficient. As the remaining six of us touched the runes, they lit up in unison, giving us the briefest flash of hope. Having informed us of this, the DM stared into her laptop screen for a moment, and said those fatal words: okay, uh, bear with me for a second here. Everything between the next two lines happened instantaneously, and was resolved in the following order: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Hill cast Confusion. I think most of us actually passed that save, but it honestly got lost in the midst of everything else. The Stone rune was next, summoning two or three earth elementals, which immediately proceeded to beat the shit out of us. Garth (the rogue) went unconscious and my warlock dropped to half. Then the Ice rune went off, casting Ice Storm and raining around 30-40 damage on us. The cleric natural 20d her Dex save, and the DM, in a moment of mercy, allowed her to get in a Spare the Dying to save the Rogue. At this point I did something which I thought was *very fucking clever*: I activated Tomb of Levistus. For the unacquainted, this warlock ability does three things, in order: 1) you become incapacitated and frozen in ice, 2) you gain 10 temporary HP per warlock level which soaks up the initial damage (60 total for me), and 3) you gain vulnerability to fire damage. To my credit, the THP was more than enough to soak up the Ice Storm damage. Then I remembered what was next. The Fire rune activated. The DM worriedly scrolled through several pages on her computer and spoke: so this spell is called Meteor Storm. Automatically failing the dex save, my poor warlock took 186 damage, enough to kill him outright several times over. The rest of the party except for Harshnag fell unconscious. The Cloud rune cast Reverse Gravity, launching the now unconscious party 120 feet into the ceiling for a failed death save and bringing Harshnag to zero. The paladins, alive and safe just outside of the room, looked on in impotent horror as every surviving PC was yanked out of range of Lay on Hands. And finally, the Storm rune set off another Storm of Vengeance. Since no one was actually under the cloud, they did escape the initial thunder damage. Bonus: [the Paladins faces as they watched all of this unfold.]( URL -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As a note, we forgot to roll actual death saves in the chaos, but I honestly dont think it mattered. Round 2 of Storm of Vengeance: acid rain triggers a failed death save, killing Garth the rogue. Round 3: the party escapes the lightning damage due to not being beneath the cloud. Round 4: of Storm of Vengeance: the hailstones finish off Alena, the cleric, and Barry fucking Bonds, the greatest baseball player who ever lived. Rounds 5-10: Cold damage. Lots and lots of cold damage. Harhnag, that wonderful bastard, was immune as a frost giant, and survived the storm with two failed death saves. The Paladins rushed into the room, hoping to salvage some piece of this campaign. Then Reverse Gravity ended. With a sickening *thunk*, poor Harshnag hit the floor, dead as a doornail. A moment of stunned silence fell over the table as the paladins stood over the wreckage of their party. The DMs sisters voice crackled over Skype: &gt;That. Was. AWESOME! "

216,vulnerability,DnD,[OC] Powerful ancient artifact inspired by Moorcocks Elric Saga,3,968lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/968lol/oc_powerful_ancient_artifact_inspired_by/,2018-08-11 02:45:22,"Mirror of Memories The Mirror of Memories is an ancient and powerful device, terrible in effectiveness and psychological damage. The mirror is roughly the size of a buckler, and has an AC of 10 and 40 hit points, but can only be destroyed by magical bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage and has vulnerability to magical bludgeoning damage. Nonmagical bludgeoning/slashing/piercing damage has no effect, and all other magical damage is simply mirrored against the caster. Any creature that looks into the mirror directly must make a DC 20 Wisdom save. On a failure they receive 8d10 psychic damage and become stunned, they must then make an additional saving throw at the end of their next turn or have their memories stolen from them, all their mental stats being reduced to 0. If they succeed they take half damage and are not stunned. Succeeding on the second saving throw removes the stunned condition. If the mirror is shattered then all creatures within one mile are subjected to the billions of memories the mirror contained. They must make three saving throws, the DC begins at 15 and a failure increases the next by 5 and a success reduces the DC by 5. Succeeding on the third results in taking 8d6 psychic damage. Failing results in the damage and indefinite madness. Lemme know what you think, thank you in advance for any critiques! Edit: The mirror can be used as a shield by those proficient with shields (though considering the possibility of shattering I might not recommend it necessarily). I imagine the mirror being held in one or both hands as protection from magic for a BBEG (but please do what ye will with it). Non-magical mundane damage does not effect the shield (though u/MonkeyShaman asked about throwing into a volcano, in which case it could be lost but not broken). The mirror does not require attunement and will function as described above even when not held by an individual. No one is immune to the effects of the mirror, if someone holding the mirror sets it down and looks into it they must make the saving throw! Mind blank can protect an individual from the effects of the mirror, and Greater Restoration cast as a 7th level spell or Wish can restore the mental abilities of an individual. Otherwise its permanent... When shattered, if any creature whose memories were stolen by the mirror (if they are within the range of one mile) will have their own memories returned to them. "

The wearer is not forced to un-attune during by the casting of the spell, and everything else follows the general rule on curses. Pretty nifty!

I have a half finished idea to hold the final feature spot at the moment. Here is what I got so far Circle of the Great Slumber-Druid Some druids choose to go into a century or so long hibernation or Great SLumber to increase their attunement with nature. Their skin grows moss and bark, and rocks attack themselves to the druids skin. These druids are now one with nature and gain many benefits from it. Natures Armor: At 2nd level, from your many years hibernating in nature you have developed a unique skin consisting of nature itself. Your armor class is increased by 20&amp;#37; of your normal armor class plus your Constitution modifier. However, your highly vegetated skin makes it so you have vulnerability to fire damage and burning. One With the Wild: At 6th level, your attunement has not only let you turn into animals, and elementals, but you can now configure into a beast created of the environment around you. You have an armor class of 21 and are considered incapacitated. While in this form you heal your hit dice amount every minute left in this form and can clobber your opponents with your overwhelming mass of trees and boulders acting as a Legendary Greatclub with 4D8 damage and a breath of green non burning spectral fire that does 1D4 damage every 2 druid levels. After using this feature you suffer two levels of exhaustion. You cannot use this ability again until after a long rest. Blessing of Life: At 10th level, your healing spells now add your proficiency bonus twice. You also regain your Constitution bonus hit points every round. Supernatural Wild Shape: At 14th level, you can now blend two creatures together to get a mutated Wild Shape. "

I want to run Dib's wagon of Doom from Kobold press as a fun encounter for one of my groups. They are all newish players. The book says it's fit for lvl 1 players but the wagon seems extremely dangerous with an extremely high chance of being able to one shot players. AC 13 Speed 0 HP 65 DMG Vulnerability Fire CR2 D6 on a 5 or 6 the cart can move 40 feet It can make a blade attack 1d6+2 and a turret attack (2d8) on its turn and also can run people over (2d6+1) and they must make a save for half DMG DC 12 dexterity . It has a damage threshold of 5 and has multiple weak points of entrance DC strength 18. That turret scares me. I was thinking off adding lots of cover for my pcs but should I scale the turret down? Maybe just 1d8? Or should I just roll with the original? I just don't feel the scale is correct here for lvl 1 characters. Im a little new to DMing and am not confident in my scaling knowledge.

220,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] first homebrew campaign as a DM. Could use some help developing the idea,1,8vbx80,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8vbx80/5e_first_homebrew_campaign_as_a_dm_could_use_some/,2018-07-02 04:27:04,"Hey D&amp;D folks, it's been a couple of years since I've taken the helm as a DM and I had the spark of an idea for a continuing campaign that I'm now working to build. Having not ever created a larger campaign adventure, I was hoping I might garner some help from the brains in r/DnD. Having not DM'ed in a long time, I'm particularly interested in what I should be focusing on to get this idea into shape by September for the players to get started. **History of the Gith** The history of the Gith is critical to the world events taking place. For the purposes of this campaign, I'm using the fictional history presented here: [Githyanki history \[5e\]](URL However this is lost history to the denizens of the material plane and the players are completely unaware of who or what the Gith even are. For the purposes of the campaign, after 10,000 years of minimal raids and no sign of Gith, the Githyanki are growing restless. Paranoid about her control of the Githyanki, Vlaakith has hatched a plan to give them exactly what they desire, and the moment for her triumph is about to arrive. **Meanwhile, in the material plane** Every 1,000 years the high clerics of each deity, gather together and channel their gods using the most sacred symbols of their faith. This ritual is known as the ""Godsmeet."" For about a two week period, the channeling allows the gods to roam the material planes and tend to their believers. It is an agreement among the pantheon to treat this time as a truce and to build up their aspects of the world they influence. The event is marked with massive festivals and the location for the Godsmeet changes each time. There is incredibly tight security around the channeling and body guards a plenty for each of the high clerics. **Enter the players** They begin their quest at lvl 3 in Baldur's Gate, all of them hoping to make it to the Southern Islands where the Godsmeet is taking place and the largest festival will be. I'm using the ""Dawn Chasers"" adventure as a way to get them on a ship headed in that direction, but caught in a storm that will delay them. As the players finally arrive (now lvl 4), they witness a scene of total chaos. Though they don't know it, Vlaakith has used her power and her army to infiltrate the security of the event ahead of time and uses the vulnerability of the clerics about to begin channeling to freeze them all and cut them off from their gods before the gods can arrive . By not killing them outright, their successors cannot take over and the world is separated from their gods The invasion has spilled out to encompass most of the festival by the time the players arrive. They will encounter a band of Githyanki far more powerful than they bargained for. With no spell casting available to their cleric, this encounter will be pretty far out of their challenge rating. As things look their bleakest, a band of Githzerai appear and fight the enemy with them, eventually casting a plane shift spell in retreat, taking the entire crew to the plane of limbo. Here they will make their way to the monasteries of the Githzerai. Upon entering, they are taken to the current leader of the Githzerai and learn part of the history of the Gith. There are no details of the deal with Tiamat or the Lich Queen. The Githzerai suggest they will do what they can to fight back their brethren, but the war rages across several planes of existence. The Githzerai request the help of the party to rally the races of the material plane and secure it from the Githyanki. They are asked to touch a relic of Zerthimon (their original leader) that gives each player limited psionic ability that will aid them in resisting the Githyanki. When they return to the material plane, a year has passed since the invasion and the world they know is in ruins. They discover a small band of races working together to form a resistance to the Githyanki, but the races of the plane are almost entirely enslaved and extra-planar monsters roam freely, all under control of the Githyanki and their Lich Queen Vlaakith. The players learn that the clerics are being held in the defiled temples of their gods all across the world and to free each enslaved race, they will need to free the cleric of each region and get their help defeating the Githyanki and their monsters in charge there. **Couple notes on mechanics** * Psionics: I haven't been able to find anything particularly useful for psionic abilities in 5e, so my plan is to basically give them a +1 psychic bonus to AC or ATK depending on their class. I'm still not quite sure how to work this in. * Divine spellcasting: This will be tough on clerics in the party, but I'm thinking they will attempt to commune with their deity and a lesser deity or demigod will respond instead, having not been caught up in the channeling mess. This deity will offer to help the cleric as best they can, but it's possible they might not be able to respond when necessary. * Character restrictions: As of yet, I'm not placing any particular restrictions on the players for their character creation. I kind of want to see how inventive they can get, but I'm obviously going to be doing my best to manage anything they bring that is ridiculously OP. So that's what I have so far. Any feedback, tips, obvious issues that need to be addressed? This is obviously pretty rough with plenty of gaps, so constructive criticism is wholly appreciated."

Now the very same DM challenged one of my friends to beat his greatest boss in a fight. So he was allowed to make himself a lvl 100 Character with one Ability Score on 30. Well.. he did make it roughly half way through before losing. And now it's my turn. And I'm not really up to it, fighting a monster that has something up it's sleeve against every possible way to kill it. So I really need some help to build a lvl 100 character that beats the shit out of this thing because I want to show my DM that if he breaks the game I'll just break his monsters. -.- I already thought of an Oathbreaker - Hexblade - Storm Scorcerer - Shadow Monk. Like, with knuckles as weapons to make up to 6 attacks with smites, mutliple times Charisma on the damge and so on. But I don't think this is nearly enough and with 100 lvls and a +10 Ability Modifier I'm sure I'm missing some potentional one-shot combos and the like. I could also get some information about the monster: \- It treats immunity as resistance, resistance as normal and normal as vulnerability. \- It can't get any levels of exhaustion. (sadly.. that was my first attempt to kill it) \- It must have around 20'000'000 hp. \- I am pretty sure it is immune to nearly any condition. \- Using spells triggers some ability of the monster, so casting many spells during combat may be a bad idea. Allowed is nearly any class, feat, race, etc from any guide/book by wizards of the coast. Anything else I've got to show to my DM and ""balance"" it, but I may still be able to pick it. I'm really glad about any help!"

Around the orc camp was corrupted forest, which up until now hadn't been a problem. But the following day, they thought it was curious that the forest was undamaged, so the warlock shot it with eldritch blast and awakened the forest. Corrupted trees began appearing anywhere people weren't looking. The opposite side of the castle, a shop owner's storehouse, etc. The necromancer used necrotic attacks on it to break through and find it hollow inside, with acid running through.

While this doesn't bother me all that much, I've been thinking of a house rule that could make vulnerabilities more common without completely breaking game balance. ""Creatures which take damage of a type they are vulnerable to take an additional 1 point of damage for every 5 points."" For example, a Lemure, a fiend, could be given a vulnerability to radiant damage. If a Cleric casts Sacred Flame with a second level spell slot and deals 10 points of radiant damage, by my variant rule, the Lemure would instead take 12 points total. Doesn't seem too game-breaking in my eyes. Though the argument could be made that it barely affects damage at all so why bother. Perhaps bumping it to +2 would make it better, but then that might be OP. Monsters which currently lack vulnerabilities, could be given these variant weaknesses. Abberations could be vulnerable to Force damage, Celestials to Necrotic, Fiends and Undead to Radiant, Elementals to their elemental opposites, etc. etc. What do you guys think about this houserule?"

I don't know if I did too much or if my DM will appreciate the detail but this is my first campaign and I wanted to do my character right. Also I wanted to share my shitty fiction. Please note that the city names are not final. I wasn't sure what world we are playing in so they are placeholders until I get more info from my DM* Bagmor was once a high ranking member of the Druidic Circle of Dreams. He was loved by many, He fell in love with a human druid named Fayemoor Eventide who also fell madly in love with him. He was 250 years old when they married. They had many children together 16 in total. They lived a long life together and saw many grandchildren and great grandchildren come into this world. However when Fayemoor died Bagmor's heart broke. The last entry in his journal that his children found simply read, ""Today I have lost my best friend. The light has gone out of my life."" His children tried to console him and his fellow druids scolded him saying that he knows the will of Taiia is absolute and that the way of nature is to flourish and die just as he will eventually die. The words of his children and the druids fell flat. His despair outweighed his faith. As the months drew into years he never overcame his loss. The Circle expelled him and his family disowned him at the Circle's command. His house fell into disrepair and when it finally collapsed he decided to leave. He has wandered the forest for many hundreds of years. In his waning years, his children long dead, he wonders and regrets what could have been if he'd had gotten over his loss and carried on. His once powerful druidic magic, due to disuse, has waned with his years. He cannot remember the feel of the magic let alone the secret incantations that once made him so powerful. He suspects he me may be senile and even his beloved Fayemoor's face sometimes slips his memory like the years that have slipped through his mind. It wasn't all bad, for a time. One day while wandering the forest, collecting berries and kindling, he heard a strange noise. A noise he hadn't heard in a hundred years, at least it could have been a hundred for all he knew or cared it could have been a thousand. But when he heard the noise it was like he was transported back in time when Faye was young and Lucio their oldest was born. This noise of course was the wailing of an infant. At first he stood silent hoping the wailing would stop and he could continue on with his miserable existence awaiting his inevitable end. He waited and waited for what seemed like an hour but the wailing persisted. His heart grew sorrowful and he became ashamed that he would let this helpless infant carry on for so long. He approached the sound silently, as his years in the forest had made him able to move as silently as the breeze, missing dried twigs ready to snap at the slightest pressure within centimeters effortlessly. As he approached from the shadows of tall oak tree he saw something he'd wished he hadn't. Under an elm, between the large roots lay a dead gnome woman. The woman had been mauled from the back and was half eaten. Then he saw what he thought must be trick of the eyes. About forty feet above the ground in the crook of the tree was a cloth bundle, no bigger than a loaf of bread. It was from this loaf that the wailing emanated. As he approached he noted the way the gnome's bones were licked clean and her insides were eaten. He suspected wolves for if this were a bear or any other creature able to climb the infant would not have been so lucky to escape the same fate. Using his Elven nimbleness he easily climbed the tree. He sat on the branch near the crook for a good minute as if stunned, but when the infant saw the humanoid figure in front of it the wailing slowed to small whimper. This snapped Bagmor out of his daze. He immediately took the infant into his arms and consoled the infant. He descended the tree in a flash which made the bundle let out an exuberant laugh. He saw that what he thought to be a newborn was in fact a little bit older than he suspected. He guessed about eight or nine months old. He found on what was left of the mother a backpack, that was relatively untouched, a supply of cloth diapers some water and other traveling gear. Why the mother had wandered into these woods, a good one month's travel from any town, he could not guess. With winter setting in and no way to get through the pass in the mountains before the snow fell Bagmor decided it was his responsibility to care for the young one, who upon further inspection was a little girl. For the first time in many years that he wandered the forest he set up a place to live and with what little bit of Transmutation magic that he could remember, he molded the earth on the side of hill into nice little hole. Not unlike hobbit holes he read about in books and had seen pictures of. The winter was hard but with his druid craft he was able to nourish the child with what he knew about the natural world. The winter eventually waned and the snow melted. The child who he named Feywind, in honor of his late wife grew before his eyes. The little one stumbled around the hobbit hole as if drunk. A sight too familiar to Bagmor who had reared sixteen children of his own. It was at this moment that Bagmor, finally feeling at least a semblance of the warmth that he felt in his heart when his wife was still alive, decided to raise the child and at least try to be happy once again. The years flowed forward as they do and Feywind grew ever curious of the world that Bagmor had forgotten. She pressed him more and more to tell him of the outside world. Feywind grew strong and nimble, learning the way of the bow and to honor the kill. She respected the forest as Bagmor had taught her and never took more than she needed, lest Bagmor scold her. From the beginning Bagmor was reluctant to tell the little gnome much about where she came from or how he found her and although Feywind knew he was not her biological father she still called him as such, Bagmor was all she ever knew. As she grew, Bagmor grew. Where once he relied on druid magic for everything he could now sense his Elvish nature and found an almost instinctive knowledge of the natural world that was different from what the druids had taught him, a more primal knowledge that he could not explain but just seemed to come intuitively. Now Bagmor was not sure of exact dates but they always celebrated Feywind's birthday as the day that the first snow fell and marked the elm tree that Bagmor had found her mother under with a notch for every year that passed. Bagmor was finally happy again However, as most things in life, happiness does not last forever. Feywind, as her twentieth birthday approached, began to ask more and more questions. And the night of her special day a full fledged argument broke out. Many things were said mostly by Feywind and Bagmor's heart wept. He realized he should not have guarded Feywind so much from the truth and when he finally revealed the way her mother had died Feywind was broken. To imagine the horrible way her own mother had suffered to save her life was too much for her. In his vulnerability upon seeing the same despair that he had known too well he agreed to take Feywind to the nearest town to let her find her own way as long as she promised to return each year on her birthday and stay the winter with him. As the years passed Feywind kept her promise. She always returned the exact day the snows fell and she would tell Bagmor of the wonderful things she had seen and heard of the outside world. They lived happily like this for ten years. On the eleventh year Bagmor watched as the snow fell for the first time that year. He waited a week before he set out to brave the mountain pass to find his Feywind. He arrived at the town of Mountain Grove battered and beaten. There they told him of his Feywind and the many great deeds that she never shared with Bagmor. She had become a folk hero. He traced her steps south to the city of Summer Petal where the trail went cold. There a human named Felgor told Bagmor a horrowing tale of a Bugbear named Goldath who led a tribe of goblins. Goldath and the goblins had taken up in an abandoned mine just a few days travel from Summer Petal. Felgor and party of adventurers, whom Feywind led, went to dispatch the threat who had killed many farmers, and raided any caravans that traveled too close to the mine. It was there that, according to Felgor, Galdath threw Feywind into the depths of the mine. The rest of the party slew the beast but they could not find any trace of Feywind. Bagmor wrought with rage, despair and suspecting foul play killed Felgor on the spot. He found a stable on the outskirts of town and stole a horse. He rode without stopping to the mine where the love of his second life fell. Bagmor frantically searched the mine knowing the city guard would send soldiers after him for his misdeed. But alas he found neither hide nor hair of his precious Feywind. Broken and shattered he left the mine. He made his way through the back roads only moving at night and taking ways only wood elves know. Until at last he reached his little hobbit hole where at one time, however brief, he was happy. Now every year when the first snow drifts in from the East, Bagmor goes to the elm tree where he found his heart. He scratches a notch into the bark and remembers all he loved who are now gone and awaits his final breath."

Come have a look!",1,8lpd5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8lpd5e/decided_to_go_ahead_and_make_the_bbeg_from_my/,2018-05-24 12:54:31,"Hi! **It goes without saying that if you are part of my campaign (Fae Folk's Folly) get outta here. Seriously. Shoo!** I've been working on a campaign for about a year (nearly two) now and with some ill-advised downtime from university work I decided to stat out some of the mid- and late game enemies and monsters that my party will be facing over the next year or two. Mordenkainen's made this a lot easier by providing a solid grounds for reference by which to create high CR monsters. This design was based on a combination of the Prince of Frost's stat block created in 4th edition in combination with a variety of the demon princes/Archdevils and ancient dragons found throughout Wizards' official materials. Any advice, critique or discussion is very welcome! So, in any case, here's my take on the Archfey, and BBEG of my campaign, the Prince of Frost. **The Prince of Frost (Approximately 18-20th level boss monster)** *Large Fey, Neutral Evil* **Armor Class** 20 (natural armour) **Hit Points** 413 (33d10 + 231) **Speed** 40ft. STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS| CHA ---|---|----|----|----|---- 24 (+7)| 26(+8) | 24 (+7) | 22 (+6)| 22 (+5) | 28 (+9) **Saving Throws** Dex +16, Con + 15, Cha +17 **Skills** Arcana + 14, Perception +13, Persuasion +17, Intimidation +17, Insight +13 **Damage Resistances** Necrotic, Fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that arent silvered. **Damage Immunities** Cold, Poison **Condition immunities.** Charmed, Exhausted, Frightened, Poisoned, Sleep **Senses** Darkvision 120ft., Passive Perception 23 **Languages** Common, Elven, Sylvan, Draconic, Giant, Primordial. **Challenge** 25 (75,000 XP) ***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the Prince of Frost can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the Prince of Frost uses his Fey Step, one creature of his choice of him that he can see within 5 feet before he teleports must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of him until the end of his next turn. ***Ice Walk.*** The Prince of Frost can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost him extra moment. ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Prince of Frosts innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: *Alter self* (Can become medium when changing his appearance), *Animate dead, Fog cloud, Gust of Wind, Frostbite, Ice Knife, Charm Person, Elemental Bane* 3/day each: *Counterspell, Dispel Magic, Dominate Person, Crown of Madness, Wall of Ice, Cone of Cold, Ice Storm, Freezing Sphere* ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Prince of Frost fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. ***Magic Resistance.*** The Prince of Frost has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. ***Regeneration.*** The Prince of Frost regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes Fire damage, this trait doesnt function at the start of his next turn. The Prince of Frost dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesnt regenerate. ***Sorrowful Presence.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the Prince of Frost must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed by the Prince of Frost for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ability Sorrowful Presence for the next 24 hours. Whenever the Prince of Frost deals damage to the charmed creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. **ACTIONS** ***Multiattack.*** The Prince of Frost attacks twice with his longsword, Bitter Edge. He can substitute Winters Bite for one of these attacks. - ***Bitter Edge.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage, or 18 (2d10 + 7) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 14 (4d6) cold damage. - ***Winters Bite.*** *Melee weapon attack.* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage and the creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or its health maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken. **REACTIONS** - ***Frigid Rebuke.*** When the Prince of Frost takes damage from a creature the Prince of Frost can see within 60 feet of it, the Prince of Frost can force that creature to succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) cold damage. - ***Curse the Flames (Recharge 6)*** *This ability is a legendary reaction and can be used whenever it is both available and the triggering condition is met.* ***Recharges automatically when Bloodied (When the Prince of Frost first drops below half of his maximum hit point total).*** When a creature within 60 feet of the Prince of Frost makes an attack that deals Fire damage, the Prince of Frost can teleport next to the attacking creature and make one attack with Bitter Edge against that attacker. If the Prince of Frost hits, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn. **LEGENDARY ACTIONS** The Prince of Frost can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Prince of Frost regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. - ***Frostbite.*** The Prince of Frost uses the Frostbite cantrip. - ***Attack.*** The Prince of Frost attacks once with Bitter Edge. - ***Blizzard Step (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Prince of Frost teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Each creature within 10 feet of his arrival point must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 20 (2d10+9) cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful save. Frost magic tears up the surroundings, turning it into difficult terrain until the end of his next turn and conferring disadvantage on ranged attacks targeting creatures within the area of effect. - ***Blood to Ice (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Prince of Frost targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of himself. The target must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 15 (1d10 + 9) Cold damage on a failed save and its movement is halved. The creature must repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. First Failed Saving Throw: The creature takes 15(1d10 + 9) Cold damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn, as its flesh begins to freeze. Second Failed Saving Throw: The target turns to ice and is Petrified. **LAIR ACTIONS.** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Prince of Frost can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: - ***Harrowing Winds.*** The Prince of Frost targets up to 3 creatures within 120 feet of him which must also be within 30 feet of each other. An icy wind, carrying the sorrow of the Prince, whips through the area and all targets must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 25 (3d10 + 9) Necrotic Damage and their speed is halved until the end of their next turn. - ***Grip of Winter.*** The Prince of Frost targets a creature which was damaged by Harrowing Winds in the previous round. That creature must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw, on a failure it is healed for 15 (1d10 + 9) hit points and the Prince of Frost can direct the creature on its next turn as it falls under his fey thrall. - ***Fortress of Tears.*** Icy walls block off areas in the Prince of Frosts lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If the Prince of Frost wishes to move through a wall, he can do so by treating the space of the wall as difficult terrain, leaving the wall intact as he passes through. **REGIONAL EFFECTS.** The Vale of the Long Night is warped by The Prince of Frosts magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: - The Prince of Frost controls the weather in the area surrounding his lair to a startling level of precision. The area within 6 miles of the lair is permanently under the effect of a control weather spell. - Frozen statues and tombs of ice populate the area, containing the frozen remains of the Prince of Frosts enemies. These icy prisons are frequently haunted by ghouls, zombies and spectres which might attack the party. - A sense of pervasive hopelessness pervades the area within 1 mile of the Princes lair, sapping creatures will to live. A creature that spends over an hour within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become listless and devoid of hope, represented by rolling on the Winter Eladrin Flaw table on pg. 62 of MToF. This saving throw can be repeated at the end of each successive hour, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw or otherwise ends the effect cant be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. Hope you like it and please let me know of anything you'd change!"

231,vulnerability,DnD,My Raven Queen Statblock,38,8nc940,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8nc940/my_raven_queen_statblock/,2018-05-31 07:06:22,"So, I like to plan my stat blocks ahead of time. Well before they reach the big bads, so that I can refer to it often and edit it for a better encounter as they go. I'm sure this is common practice, but hey. So with Tome of Foes, I was *really* hoping we would finally get a proper Raven Queen stat block. The half-goddess is heavily mentioned in it and with her fingers dipped into my campaign, I wanted to have her stat block ready just in case someone does something *really* stupid. So here's the stat block I've personally made for her. And I'd like some criticism. I've used the Demogorgon as a base for her stat block and I've done what I can with it. The formatting may be a little bit sticky, so if you stick with me and critique it, I really do appreciate it! #The Raven Queen Medium Fey; Neutral Alignment; Goddess of Death Armor Class: 24 (Divine Aura) Hit Points: 1,024 (80d20+224) Speed: 50 ft; 60 ft Flight ___________________________ #Ability Scores Str: 16 Dex: 24 Con: 26 Int: 20 Wis: 22 Cha: 30 **Saving Throws:** Str +10, Dex +9, Con +16, Int +11, Wis +11, Cha +15 **Skills:** Insight +18, Perception +20, Stealth +18 **Damage Resistances:** Cold; Radiant **Damage Immunities:** Necrotic; Poison; bludgeoning piercing and slashing that is nonmagical **Senses**: Truesight 120 ft, passive perception 30 **Languages** - All, telepathy 120 ft. **CR**: 30 (155,000 EXP) _______________________________ #Features **Multi-Spell.** Once per turn, the Raven Queen may opt to cast one spell with a casting time of one action as a bonus action. **Magic Resistance.** The Raven Queen has advantage on all saving throws caused by magical effects. **The Sands of Decay.** Any nonmagical equipment The Raven Queen holds is immediately aged until it turns to dust. **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** When the Raven Queen would fail a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead. ___________________ #Actions **Grasp.** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, Reach of 5 ft, One Target Hit: 11 (2d10) Necrotic Damage **The Raven's Call.** As an action, The Raven Queen calls to her followers to prove themselves worthy of her glory. In 1d4 turns, 1d6+2 Shadar-Kai Shadowdancers emerge from portals to the Shadowfell, appearing randomly in the area, up to the DM's discretion. If the Shadar-Kai are killed, The Raven Queen gains 40 temporary hit points for each defeated Shadowdancer. **Gaze.** The Raven Queen casts the gaze of Death itself upon one creature she can see. The target must succeed a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or be subject to one of the following effects, determined randomly by rolling 1D6. 6s are a reroll. **1. Gaze of Denial** The target is hit with the full emotional dread of the Shadowfell, and their mind finds it difficult to cope. The target suffers 3d8 Psychic damage and their Wisdom score is immediately reduced by 1d4. This effect can only be ended by a Greater Restoration or Wish spell. **2. Gaze of Wrath** The target experiences an urge of defiance toward the encroachment of death. for the next 1d8 turns, the target receives 3d8 Necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. If the target survives the final roll of this effect, they must make a Dexterity saving throw as they feel the earth beneath them begin to shake. On a failure, the target takes the total damage dealt by this ability as one blast of necrotic energy that erupts from the ground. On a success, they suffer no damage but are considered prone. Their turn then continues as normal. **3. Gaze of Proposition** The target is forced inward mentally. At the start of the target's next turn, they are given a proposition. They may choose not to act on this turn, or reduce their maximum HP by 40 and one of their ability scores (of their choice) by 2. If the target accepts the bargain, they awaken as their body begins to collapse and their turn proceeds as normal. If they do not accept this bargain, they are considered incapacitated until their next turn. When they awaken on their following turn, they are considered prone but suffer no other ill effects caused by this ability. **4. Gaze of Depression** The target is flooded by emotion and are afflicted by a condition unique to this ability; Despair. Creatures afflicted by Despair cannot take reactions, and any actions or bonus actions taken require the target to pay a cost of 5 hit points. You cannot substitute temporary hit points for this cost. If the cost would reduce a creature's hit points to 0, the action is carried out as normal before the target falls unconscious. Any healing effect would cause the afflicted target to be healed and remain conscious. This effect can only be ended by a Greater Restoration or Wish spell. **5. Gaze of Acceptance** The target becomes infatuated with death, fascinated by it, and loses the will to resist it for 1d4 of its turns. During this time, the target cannot regain hit points by any means, and it has disadvantage on all saving throws caused by The Raven Queen or her allies. The target also gains a vulnerability to Necrotic damage for the duration. This effect can be ended early by a Greater Restoration or Wish spell. ________ #Legendary Actions **At-Will Spell.** The Raven Queen casts one of her at-will spells. **Gaze.** (Costs 2 Actions) The Raven Queen can use her Gaze ability. **Teleport.** The Raven Queen casts Teleport. ________________________ #Spells _____________ #Cantrips Chill Touch Prestidigitation ______________ #1st Level (At Will) Sleep Hellish Rebuke Cure Wounds Detect Poison and Disease Command ________________ #2nd Level (At Will) Knock Mirror Image Darkness Alter Self Silence Ray of Enfeeblement ___________________ #3rd Level (At Will) Counterspell Dispel Magic Fear Fireball Gaseous Form ___________________ #4th Level (5 Slots) Banishment Death Ward Dimension Door Blight ______________ #5th Level (5 Slots) Greater Restoration Geas Scrying Flame Strike Insect Plague __________________ #6th Level (4 Slots) Circle of Death Chain Lightning Flesh to Stone Heroes' Feast ______________ #7th Level (4 Slots) Forcecage Finger of Death Delayed Blast Fireball Teleport Regenerate Etherealness Plane Shift _________________ #8th Level (3 Slots) Feeblemind Dominate Monster Maze ____________ #9th Level (3 Slots) Meteor Swarm Power Word Kill Time Stop True Resurrection"

Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. ***Fertile Breath.*** The Zomok exhales a blast of dirt, bark, stones and moss, which takes root as soon as it touches the ground in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The creature may be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 19 Strength check and succeeds. For the next minute the ground affected by this ability is considered difficult terrain **LEGENDARY ACTIONS** The Zomok can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

AC 5, HP 10, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage and immunity to psychic damage. **Engulf.** The Zomok can use this option only if a creature is affected by two or more tendrils. *Target:* One creature affected by two or more tendrils. The Zomok uses its Engulf on the target. **Awesome Blow (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon attacks with an open claw at its surroundings, throwing up dirt and rubble. Each creature within 10 feet of the Zomok must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked away 10 feet and prone. The creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage if this movement forces it into the space of a piece of terrain or additional creature. In the case of a creature, that creature must all succeed on a DC19 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed in a single direction. URL Picture from the Pathfinder Monster manual, by Damien Mammoliti"
233,vulnerability,DnD,What I learned from running a 0-level adventure [5e],81,8o9e5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8o9e5i/what_i_learned_from_running_a_0level_adventure_5e/,2018-06-04 01:52:29,"Back in the 80s, a module called ""Treasure Hunt"" was published. It was a 0\-level adventure that, when finished, helped you create a PC based on what happened the adventure. I was thinking about that experience the other day, so I decided to do a one\-shot 0\-level adventure for my group. Here's what we did: We rolled 4d6 \(dropped lowest\) and assigned scores in order \(from Strength to Charisma\). We randomly rolled for race and used a website that calculates things from Xanathar's ""this is your life"" We even randomly determined alignment using a d10 and ignoring 10. None of the characters were proficient in anything. No armour, no weapons \- nothing. We rolled a d8 \+ Con mod for hit points. Basically, we randomised everything we could and filled out our sheets. The results were interesting to say the least. For example, we had a chaotic good Tabaxi soldier whose high stat was a 17 Str and low stat was a 4 Wis. We had a lawful evil Kobold soldier with PTSD, a 17 Str and 16 Cha \- Intelligence was 9. We had a Lawful Evil Drow elf with a 16 Cha and 7 Dex AFTER the racial bonus. He was also paranoid. I told all the players this is ""where we start."" Nothing is set in stone, but these are the cards you're dealt. Throughout the adventure, I asked them to note what skills they were using, what memorable or exceptional things happened to them, and to pay particular attention to their character's traits, bonds and flaws. Even though these weren't ""permanent,"" they were important for this adventure. Then we ran the adventure, and THEY LOVED IT, and so did I. This is what I learned from the experience: * I encouraged the players with really low stats to embrace that aspect of their character. The player of the Drow did this with gusto and not only survived the entire adventure, but was clearly everyone's favourite PC. Embracing low scores encouraged them to think creatively and to roleplay more often. * The vulnerability of their characters made them extra\-cautious \- not to the point where they were afraid to do anything, but to a point that it really gave encounters a real sense of versimilitude. It wasn't just a crazy bunch of murder hobos looting and pillaging. These were thoughtful encounters where players were concerned with survival \(for themselves and each other\) * Not choosing all of the aspects of their PC allowed them to stretch their roleplaying. * With no proficiency bonus, the PCs could have easily been outgunned. However, they quickly caught on that I was giving ""Inspiration"" for roleplaying, so in order to give their PCs a little boost in combat and skills, they really embraced roleplaying, and I was giving insipiration left and right. * Taking this approach not only affected how we created PCs, but it also affected how they played the characters. People weren't playing the game the way they normally played PCs they carefully crafted. All in all, it was a great experience. After the adventure, most of the players decided to keep their PCs the way they were, and I let them keep the d8 of HP they rolled as a bonus for playing a 0\-level adventure. Only one of the players changed his PC by using a standard array. He wanted to play a monk, and a 7 Wis was just NOT going to work. I really recommend trying a one\-shot 0\-level adventure just to shake things up a bit. It's a great way to take a different approach to the game."
234,vulnerability,DnD,"Campaign Idea: a lighter-weight, fairy tale-style game",2,8ohsrr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8ohsrr/campaign_idea_a_lighterweight_fairy_talestyle_game/,2018-06-05 00:43:39,"Here's an idea for a more classic, fairy-tale style campaign. You may notice parts of the story bear a passing similarity to stories from pop culture; some of it is loosely based on a movie I saw once. The PCs stay the night in an inn on the way to some other place. During the night, a horrendous storm blows in and rips the inn free of its foundations with the party inside. After being carried by the storm for several hours, the inn falls free and lands in the middle of a village. Upon leaving their rooms, the PCs discover that all of the inn's patrons and staff have mysteriously vanished. When they exit the inn, the PCs find themselves in a small village, whose brightly colored structures are too small for a Medium-sized creature to fit comfortably inside. After exploring for a bit, a human sorceress, Galyn, teleports in front of them and informs them that they have unwittingly killed Gulka, the sorceress who ruled this province, when the inn fell to earth. Once she determines that the PCs' intentions are not evil, Galyn gives the all-clear signal and the gnomes that inhabit the village come out of hiding. The gnomes thank the characters for killing Gulka, who was a vile despot. Galyn retrieves a ring from the corpse of Gulka, which protrudes slightly from beneath the inn, and gives it to the characters. She claims the ring is magic, but any attempt to identify or attune to the ring fails. Just then, a third sorceress, Almyr, appears. She reveals that Gulka was her sister and vows revenge on the characters for killing her. She briefly attempts to steal the ring from them, but flees when Galyn threatens her. Galyn then tells the characters that they have been transported to a demiplane, and cannot return home without the aid of a *plane shift* spell. Unfortunately, the only person capable of casting such a spell is the Archmagus, who rules the land from his castle in the City of Jewels to the west. Galyn wishes the characters luck before teleporting away. After being declared heroes by the gnomes, the characters set off along the Road of Golden Bricks, which leads to the City of Jewels. Unfortunately, Almyr sets up numerous traps and ambushes for them. She has many tricks up her sleeve, from casting *awaken* on groves of trees to swooping in on her *broom of flying* to cast *fireball* and *fog cloud* spells. Not all creatures the characters encounter are in league with Almyr. They meet an animated scarecrow who gives them directions, an iron golem who is rusted in place, and an awakened lion who attacks from stealth the first chance he gets, but then flees after one round of combat. After narrowly avoiding Almyr's plan to kill them while they are under the influence of a *sleep* spell, the characters finally make it to the City of Jewels. Here they can resupply and purchase new equipment at various shops or rest at the inn. When they decide to make their way to the Archmagus's castle, Almyr shows up on her *broom of flying* and demands the ccharacters' surrender, threatening the safety of the city if its people don't give the characters up. This event causes a panic, and the Archmagus's soldiers refuse to allow anyone entry into the castle, including the PCs. The PCs must either talk their way past the guards, sneak past them, or (if they're really confident) fight their way inside. Once inside, the characters make their way to a central chamber, where a phantasmal shape wreathed in fire floating above an enormous altar greets them, claiming to be the Archmagus. The Archmagus's aspect agrees to send the characters back to their home plane only if they kill Almyr and bring back proof of her demise. So, the characters set off to the west, toward Almyr's castle. On the way, they are beset by many of the sorceress's evil minions, including packs of wolves and dire wolves, swarms of wasps, and an army of winged kobolds. They finally arrive at the castle to find it teeming with elite hobgoblin guards. After either fighting or sneaking their way inside, the characters finally have their showdown with Almyr. She is a powerful combat spellcaster, but has vulnerability to acid damage. After the characters defeat Almyr, the hobgoblins swear fealty to them, tired of living under her iron fist. Upon their return to the City of Jewels, the Archmagus tries to reneg on the deal. However, a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals an ordinary human hiding in an alcove, operating a machine which creates the illusion the characters had previously been speaking to. After being found out, the man (Who is, in fact, the Archmagus) admits to being a fraud; several years ago, the airship he was travelling on was blown off course by a bad storm and sucked into this demiplane. When local denizens saw him descending from the heavens, they assumed he must be a powerful wizard and submitted themselves to his rule. With the characters to crew the airship, the ""Archmagus"" thinks they may all be able to fly back to the Prime Material together. However, as the characters are preparing to embark, a freak wind lifts the ship into the sky. Unwilling to lose out on the favorable weather conditions, the Archmagus flies off, abandoning the characters. Just when things look hopeless, Galyn arrives to tell the characters that, having purged the land of evil, they have unlocked the magic of the ring she gave to them back in the gnome village. Whoever is carrying the ring then immediately attunes to it. The ring has the following properties: **Ring of Homecoming** A creature who is attuned to this ring can close their eyes, speak the command word, and take three steps in any direction. Upon opening their eyes, the user and up to five willing creatures of their choosing find themselves back in the user's home land. The specific meaning of the word ""home"" is subjective, but should be someplace important to the user's past, such as the town in which they were born or raised. Once the characters have attuned to the ring, Galyn vows to rule the demiplane beneficently in the Archmagus's stead, sending vassals to the Eastern and Wester Provinces (where the two dead sorceresses used to rule) to oversee those areas as well. She thanks the characters for ridding the land of evil before bidding them goodbye."
235,vulnerability,DnD,[5E] Character build: The Anti-Magic Doggo,2,8olsf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8olsf6/5e_character_build_the_antimagic_doggo/,2018-06-05 08:58:09,"Hey all, so my gnome wizard just got murderized and I need to build a new one. The thing is, after all the magic, all the finicky spellcasting rules, endless reasoning with the dm for spell uses, the long turns spent measuring spell ranges, radius and how many of the idiot barbarian and fighter's brain cells would be incinerated if I toss a happy little fireball right there... I am completely done with mages. Luckily we have 2 other spellcasters, so I can go straight into taking out my frustrations by building the ultimate mage killer, a adventurer so attuned to murdering those pesky spellcasters that we'll never need to worry about a creepy wizard waving his disgusting old man fingers at us again. So here's my build so far (btw the DM has ok'd UA and stuff). It's not complete since we're only level 6 so I'll take any advice for further advancement to improve my ability at bitch slapping magic nerds. Stats: (rolled) STR - 15 DEX - 18 CON - 15 INT - 9 WIS - 16 CHA - 11 Race: Longtooth Shifter (UA - Eberron) - +1 dex, +1 str Can use a bonus action to go beastmode for 1 minute, gaining temp HP = to level + con mod, and getting a 1d6 bite attack that grapples on hit. Class: Blood Hunter (praise be to Matt Mercer may his hair be forever silky) Lvl 1 - Drank some nasty potion: * ADV on tracking bad things * Cant be suprised by bad things while tracking them Lvl 1 - Crimson Rite at this level, 1d6 extra fire (or lightning) damage on attacks but i lose a bit of hp. Lvl 2 - Fighting Style * Dueling, because everything else sucks for this build. Lvl 2 - Blood Maledicts At level 6 we get 2 blood maledicts and can use them twice per short or long rest, so obviously we go for the anti-magic ones: * Blood curse of the Fending Rite: When a spell makes you do a dex save, you can add your wis modifier to the saving throw as a reaction. If you take some extra damage you can also give this to friendlies within 5ft of you. Good mostly for when your own sorceror blasts the entire battlefield. * Blood curse of Spell Sunder: When someone makes a spell attack against you from within 60ft, you can use your reaction to give it disadvantage. Take a bit of damage to turn that into a making a wisdom check against 10 + the spell's level to make it miss automatically. Lvl 3 - Order of the ~~Doggo~~ Lycan Hoooo boy there's a lot of features here so I'll just give the cliffnotes version. * Advantage on listening and sniff perception checks * Basically the barbarian rage but it lasts for 10 minutes and you become a ~~doggo~~ werewolf. While transformed: * ADV on str checks/saves * +half your proficiency on melee damage rolls * +1 to AC * Resistance against nonmagical weapon attacks that aren't silvered (this shit's broken yo) * Can use dex-based unarmed attacks that do 1d6 slashing (both hands count as 1 weapon for the crimson damage thingo), and you can make 1 as a bonus action. Damage increases with level. * Vulnerability to silvered weapons (who the hell uses silvered weapons anyway) * If you took damage last turn, make a DC10 or half damage taken wisdom saving throw or basically lose control to bull rush and attack the closest creature, should be k. Lvl 4 - Mage Slayer Yay someone is actually using this feat. * Can oppurtunity attack anyone that casts a spell next to you. * Any concentration checks from damage you deal have disadvantage. * ADV vs saving throws against spells cast by ppl next to you. Lvl 5 - More attack yay Lvl 6 - More damage and stuff. Alright, now that all that's listed and done. The basic idea for this character is that he's a werewolf that's been trained to track down and kill bad magic people. So the general stratagy in combat is to first, take a turn to transform (action - Lycan Transform, bonus action - Shifter Transform). We then charge straight at the nearest creepy mage, ignoring all the pinpricky attacks from those non-silvered weapons with our bonus hp from Shifter and resistance. We make our bite attack against the frankly sad AC that caster have and grapple them (unless they have the shield spell, then we just cry). After they are firmly lodged in our teeth (bonus action claw attack for extra flair), we can proceed to beat the everloving shit out of the spellcaster. * Unless they take a turn to shocking grasp + misty step (which is a turn spent not distintegrating the cleric), they can't pull away from the anti-magic doggo with their sad little STR and DEX scores. * If they cast a spell, they get a nice claw to the face. * If they cast a spell at **us** we have advantage against the save...and then they get a nice claw to the face. * If they casted a spell that is concentration, they get a nice claw to the face **and** they immediately need to make a concentration check with disadvantage. * Bonus: If they try to blast the melee crew, blood maledict gives a bonus to any dex saves. * Bonus Bonus: If they **do** try shocking grasp or any other spell attack, can use the other blood maledict to make it miss (probably). * If they teleport away, chase after them, rinse and repeat. My plan for later levels: * At 7th level, the order of lycan gives a nice +10ft movement speed to catch up to any teleporting mages. * At 8th level, take the charger feat for a 80ft dash + the bite attack to re-grapple onto any targets that ran away. (with a happy little +5 to damage). * At 9th level, we can get that nifty blood maledict that can reduce a creature's movement speed to 0, take some damage to ignore size restaints and reduce the world turtle's movement speed to 0 and hurtle everyone into the endless void of space. * At 10th level blood hunter, get another 10ft movement speed when you're in dim light or darkness. That's a 100ft charge at a misty stepping mage with a bite coming right up. * At 11th level order of the lycan, the damage becomes 1d8 on claw attacks AND your crimson rite damage, you get to add your wisdom mod to claw attacks AND you regen 1 + your con mod at the start of each turn...oh and also use your blood maledicts 3 times per short rest. After that, take a few levels in monk: * Ditch the half plate, get 17 AC while naked (18 when transformed) * Learn some sick kung-fu. * Get another +10ft to movement speed (we're at **60ft** per turn in dim light now bois) * Use Ki for more claws to the face (still using the better order of the lycan unarmed strikes with crimson rite) * Use Ki for bonus action 120ft dash + chomp (at this point, dont even neeed the charger feat, so don't take it if multiclassing into monk I guess?). And as a neat little bonus, the level 7 lycan feature gave us a 10ft bonus to jump distance, which is then doubled with the bonus action dash, plus the base long jump of 15ft (strength score), you can now jump **35 feet**, further than the dwarf fighter can run on their turn. * Catch arrows shot at you and stab them into the creepy mage you're biting because why would you throw it at someone else? (no disadvantage either if you have grappler). More concentration checks from this too because fuck your spell slots. And finally, the monk feature we've been waiting for, drumroll... * Use 2 ki points to cast silence centered on yourself. Now the poor mage is stuck grappled by you, being cut to ribbons by 3 attacks (at advantage if you have grappler) for 1d8 (claw) + 1d8 (fire damage) + 4 (dex) + 2 (lycan bonus damage which scales with proficiency bonus btw, so the multiclass doesnt hurt it). for an average of 16 damage per hit, so 48 per round (64 if you use flurry of blows) assuming you hit everything. They can't cast spells with verbal components, if they break free from grapple and run away you'll catch them with your 120ft dash movespeed and drag them back into the silence spell to continue turning them to shredded lettuce on the next turn. For even more anti-heresy flavor, the anti-magic doggo comes with a premium witchhunter kit with sets of gags, manacles, chains, daggers to cut off those heretical mage tongues and a branding iron you can heat up with your crimson rite to make sure they dont bleed out. For extra gravy on the anti-magic steak, we can take Grappler at later levels for: * Once you bite down on them, all your attacks get advantage. * If your team feels like beating down on them, make another grapple check to pin and restrain them (and you). * Can grapple larger creatures...good for if you want to grapple a really fat mage I guess? Or a dragon. Even against non mages, you have a unarmed grappler monk with relatively high damage, 18 AC, a 60ft movespeed, a 120ft dash with a grapple attack followup, resistance against nonmagical nonsilvered weapons. All in all, I think it's a fun build that'll be interesting to play. I enjoyed making use of 2 feats that have never really been used in any games I've played in, plus the flavor of the character is really interesting to me as well. If you've read this far, please leave any thoughts or suggestions you have and I'll be glad to read them. Thanks!"

Does that strike anyone else as kind of a huge drawback? I mean, regular werewolves and other lycanthropes in 5E aren't vulnerable to silver, it's just that they are immune to non-silver, non-magical weapons and therefore silver weapons just do normal damage to them."

This was the spot, Valec had learned, that Senator Cedarbloom intended to meet with the crime lord, Ghahenna the Shark, to discuss underhanded business not fit for the niceties of his office. The politician looked everywhere for signs of the mob boss's arrival, ready to be done with this risky encounter. Little did the senator know, Ghahenna laid dead at the bottom of the river, dumped not 100 feet from where he stood. Valec had made it quick. A whisper from the left, a blade from the right. The crimelord thought himself untouchable on his own turf. He had been wrong. Valec knew all too well the vulnerability of assuming safety. Amusing as it was to watch the politician squirm, Valec had other errands this night, so he set about his business. He carefully removed the ivory mask from his gaunt face, closed his eyes, and concentrated on the swirling darkness in his pocket. The shapeless mass was, in fact, a shadow of the late Ghahenna the Shark. Valec had a knack for collecting shadows. He continued concentrating on the dark essence, seeing memories of Ghahenna's as if he had lived them. He let the shadow of the dead man combine with his own, merging with his own, then opened his eyes. He looked down at the gaudy silver rings on hands that were not his own, saw and smelled the dirty dreadlocks hanging around his downturned head. He permitted himself a quiet chuckle, noting the raspy sound so different from his own. ""Nice seein' you again,"" he said as he walked towards the nervous man. ""Let's get this over with, Ghahenna. You know I cant be seen with you."" ""Discreet, as always, Cedarbloom. Now, about this opponent of yours..."" With the knowledge of Cedarbloom's campaign plans, Valec could make a hefty amount of coin. With the proof of his dealings with the underground, he had complete and total control over Cederbloom. Information was more than worth its weight in gold to people like Valec. The right people would stay in the right places for Valec to keep up his charade. He concluded the meeting and returned to the shadows, making sure the senator went on his way. After he was gone, Valec allowed the foriegn shadow to separate from his own, his hands returning to the maroon color of a tiefling. He replaced his pale mask over his face, covering all but the stubs of his shorn horns. Valec entered the large oak doors to his manor, stretching the weariness out of his aging bones. So many years he has done this. Playing the noble Lord Rivendare by day, signing petitions and attending summits, yearning for the nights where he can unleash himself upon the city. He crept up the sprawling staircase, careful to avoid the spots he knew groaned beneath his weight. At the top of the climb, he saw that the candle was still burning in the room to his left, where his greatest treasure lied. He eased in the door and saw that the small girl was still asleep in her bed, as she had been hours earlier. Her salmon colored skin glistened with sweat, the burns covering her face sending pangs of regret through him. Valec quietly crossed the room and opened the window, feeling the cool breeze enter the room. He brushed her dark hair away and lightly kissed her forehead before blowing out the light. All this he did for her. This city and this life would always be prosperous for her, he would see to that. Valec retired to his own chambers, taking care to hide his mask and his heavy cloak. It would not do to be careless after all these years. He looked again at the portrait of his wife above the large bed. ""I will keep her safe, my love,"" he whispered to himself. ""That I swear."" This is my second post of a list of NPCs that my PCs love and wanted me to share. Feel free to throw him in your stories. I tried to leave his history a little more vague in this story than in my campaign. Please let me know what you all think. I may post another story or two tonight. Thanks again!"

241,vulnerability,DnD,Does resistance cancel vulnerability? Does 1 instance of resistance counter multiple counts of vulnerability? Context in the post.,5,8qltw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8qltw2/does_resistance_cancel_vulnerability_does_1/,2018-06-13 05:26:47,"Okay, so one of my players has a vulnerability to fire damage from their race. However they've got an ability where they can grant themselves resistance. So the first question: Would the resistance cancel the vulnerability? I assume and rule that it would, but I can sometimes miss things, so confirmation is greatly appreciated. Secondly, the player has the Warlock invocation ""Tomb of Levistus"" which will give them vulnerability to fire damage (again). I know that multiple counts of vulnerability *usually* count as one but if the previous one has been cancelled would it have an effect? The only comparable example is Advantage/Disadvantage rules, where 2 Advantages count as 1. However a Disadvantage cancels Advantage out. So if somebody had 3 Advantages (somehow) and 2 Disadvantages (weirdly) then they still have Advantage. So the second question: If the resistance usually cancels the race vulnerability, would this invocation vulnerability count as the first vulnerability, and so they gain vulnerability and it is not cancelled? Sorry about how wordy and annoyingly complicated this post is and thank you in advance."

In the last session, my party killed a custom Stone Golem named Pericles that had been hunting them throughout the Underdark. Upon defeating the Golem, it crumbled to pieces and the players noted that embedded in some of the pieces were shiny things. One of which was a cursed ring, a magic item that i had thought up. And it just so happened to be luck that the monk picked it up The ring is something i made that is enchanted with damage enhancement. When attuned to it, you chose one damage type, piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning. Any attack that hits and deals your chosen damage type deals max damage, and in addition you crit on a 19 or 20. It is also cursed with damage vulnerability, which is not revealed upon attunment. The two damage type you did not chose now deal max damage to you, and also crit on a 19 or 20. Also while attuned to this item, you get a permanent massive migraine that starts an hour after attunement. When you attempt to rest, you must make a DC 12 con save or be unable to sleep, gaining a level of exhaustion. Every 3 days you must make a DC 10 Wisdom save or gain one random permanent madness effect As the Will of Gygax allowed, the monk picked it up, figured out what its benefits, and nearly had an aneurism. He immediately attuned to it. When he did, blue glyphs flared up along the outside. Out of curiosity, he tried to remove the ring and immediately dropped do to massive amounts of psychic damage. The glyphs rearranged themselves to make the words: ""Pericles always claims his victims"" Opinions on this item? Will i end up regretting it? Will the monk be able to live with the effects. "
243,vulnerability,DnD,Mirror of Life Trapping: A Campaign Worthy Item,4,8e1o82,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8e1o82/mirror_of_life_trapping_a_campaign_worthy_item/,2018-04-22 16:47:07,"I just wanted to share this idea for a campaign with you all, since my group found it incredibly fun and engaging. I was running a one shot to introduce a few new players to the game, but was stumped for ideas. When browsing through the items I came acrossed this beauty, and it's now my favorite item in the game. For those who don't wanna look it up, here's what it does: *When this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. *If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again. *Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror's twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror's nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. *An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror's cells don't age, and they don't need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. *If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. So what makes it so awesome? Well, I was able to build a one shot campaign and plot around it. I always loved the idea of building a campaign around a fun item, like a Wabbajack or a Deck of Many Things. But this has to be my favorite. Here's the setup: I gave the mirror to the party (through their adventure faction or whatever), explained the basic mechanics, and had them to use it to imprison a beasty that has been plaguing the town for far too long. The beasty is so powerful that the locals (and the party) are too weak to defeat by normal means. Really sell the fact that the mirror is the only way. This already gives the party a clear goal/target, and also a fun, mysterious item to gawk at and investigate. It also gives your campaign a big bad and some lore. Lastly, it gives you 12 slots to stretch your DM legs and be truly nasty with what you put in the prison. But Here are some ways to take it to the next level: 1. All 12 cells of the mirror are already housing powerful/tricky enemies when the party gets it. Just have the quest giver say ""I don't know how many prisoners it can hold, nor how many are already in there"". My party was lvl 5, and so I filled it with monsters that were 5-8 Challenge Ratings above that. I had an Adult Brass Dragon, a Bone Devil, an Efreeti, etc. With the mirror full of deadly enemies, it makes breaking the mirror an EXTREMELY bad situation, as all the prisoners will be freed at once. You don't have to fill all 12 cells, But I did. This way, when party makes their way through the lair of their big bad and finally traps him in the mirror, another one of the prisoners is pooped out. This creates an awesome plot twist just when they thought they had victory. It will leave them scratching their heads, but also being stared down by a beasty that is possibly even scarier than the one they just fought so hard to defeat. Of course, their knee jerk reaction will be to trap the new enemy, and pray that whatever gets pooped out next is weak enough to deal with. This might seem like an endless trap, but luckily we DM's have full control of what's in those prison cells. So, yes most of them will be scary and impossible, but throw in two or three ""ways out"". Get creative here, don't make it too easy, but make it something the party can finally deal with after their hellish roulette. For me, I chose a Rakshasa. Still really scary, but not necessarily malevolent. I had mine instantly shapeshift into a duplicate of our wizard, then had him cast minor illusion about 10 times to make more copies. If the party wants to seal him back in the mirror, they will have to A. Figure out which is the fake, (the Rakshasa being able to cast detect thoughts makes this impossible), and B. Deal with whatever comes out of the mirror in its place. My party tends to be both smart and lazy, so they chose instead to let the Rakshasa go free, out into the world, instead of chancing what the other mirror prisoners could be. (Little do they know, he will become the main villain of their next adventure.) 2. This is just cruel, but I made the party's target a Vampire. They can't see their own reflection, yet the party's goal was to seal him into the mirror. And with a Vampire being CR 13, the mirror truly was their only hope. I honestly had no idea how the party would get the Vamp to see his own reflection in the mirror, but they came up with the genius idea of using the Faerie Fire spell behind the Vamp right as he gazed into the mirror, creating a flash of color that outlined the Vamp's silhouette. It was so genius that I decided that seeing his own silhouette in the mirror would be enough to trap the Vamp inside. I also thought of making the target some sort of incredibly powerful, yet blind monster. How will a blind monster see his own reflection? Well the party will have to either cure his blindness, or Find a robe of eyes or something. But anyways, get creative with the party's big bad. Give it a ""catch"". Anyways, I've rambled for long enough. But I'll summarize by saying my favorite part of this idea is that it showcases the game itself so well to new players. A full mirror presents a puzzle/riddle for the players, the mirror itself is an obstacle, as they have to carry the 50 lb hunk of fragile glass through the lair without it breaking. You can fill the mirror with the most iconic D&amp;D monsters and show them off, and be as nasty as you want without the players feeling cheated. The campaign lasted about 6 hours, but it could easily be lengenthed depending on what you do with the mirror."

246,vulnerability,DnD,A Wild Sheep Chase - strange twist,9,8fepql,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8fepql/a_wild_sheep_chase_strange_twist/,2018-04-28 06:19:51,"I just ran [The Wild Sheep Chase](URL (spoilers below, just FYI) for a new group of players and had a surprise ending occur. I need some help figuring out how to continue what has turned out to be the start of a short campaign. **Background** I'm DMing for a group of four players new to DnD (let alone 5e) through LMoP. Our two rogue players (we made characters in private to avoid min-maxing as a party) were in and out of the country but the necromancer and Tempest cleric wanted to play some more without leaving them behind. We decided to organize a one-shot with two friends who played as some of the premades from LMoP. We did Matt Colville's [Tomb of the Delian Order](URL and all the players had a great time interacting with the townsfolk, tracking the goblins through the woods, ambushing the patrol, and taking back the tomb to save the young girl. I should mention that they found combat to be the most boring part and much preferred role-playing and interaction. After the next session of LMoP with the main group, our two rogues left for the weekend and our necromancer and cleric again asked me to run another one-shot with the same two friends. I decided to turn the string of one-shots into a pseudo-campaign and had them start by returning the girl they had saved in the tombs of the Delian Order to her father and hang out in town listening to rumors. Our necromancer had a sizable collection of goblin ears she hoped to turn in for the bounty and they decided to head into the nearby city to do so. Perfect. I had hoped to run A Wild Sheep Chase for this session. After turning in the goblin ears for some hard coin, the party notices a stray sheep with a scroll in its mouth. What a surprise. **Adventure** Since the party is just level 2 at this point (I decided the events of these one-shots occur before LMoP and the necromancer and cleric don't want to out-level their rogue friends), I scaled everything down to be the appropriate difficulty. They killed Guz and took Shinebright in his wooly form back home to confront Noke. I gave them a skill challenge to make it through all the defenses a paranoid wizard would set up and they failed it, triggering an owlbear encounter. I was impressed how they handled the fight - making sure the rogue always had access to sneak attack, keeping between the owlbear and necromancer, etc. - especially since their combat tactics had been rather uninspired throughout the sessions we had played. I hoped to show them that you could use just as much imagination for combat as for talking to townsfolk and that it wasn't just rolling and hoping your attack hit. So I decided to change the final encounter with Noke in a few small ways. The main one was that Noke would cast enlarge on the black bear but then retreat into the uppermost platform and hide for the rest of the fight. When they went up to confront him, he explained his side of the story and tried to talk it out. To my surprise, the group of four charged into the small room almost immediately and attack him. That's fine, this would be a great opportunity to show that clever thinking is just as important as good rolls in combat. I explained how Noke pointed the cracked wand in his hand at the bed upon which he stood. I described the bed in detail, paying special attention to the unvarnished wood and dry cotton sheets. I mentioned how the lit brazier that stood nearby toppled over as the bed reared up and, with Noke still on top, burst out through the branches of the platform and into the air. The plan was that the Bed Wyrm would do a nice slow circle of the perimeter in the manner of dragonkind time out of mind. Then it and Noke would make a pass over the tower after everyone had two turns of combat. I hoped to illustrate the importance of positioning and damage types through the AoE splinter breath and vulnerability of the Bed Wyrm to fire. Unfortunately, the party spent their turns throwing javelins, shooting arrows, and choosing cold for the damage type of Chromatic Orb. When the Wyrm made its attack, they were all standing next to each other at the edge of the tower. DM: ""With the great creaking sound of dry wood bending, the Bed Wyrm opens its mouth and spends a flurry of splinters at a 15ft cone towards the top of the tower. Everyone make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw"" Cleric: ""4, Jesus"" Fighter: ""8 minus 1, so 7"" Necromancer: ""I rolled an 8 too"" Rogue: ""9"" DM: ""With your Dexterity bonus?"" Rogue: ""Yep"" DM: ""Okay, as you look for a place to hide you are hit by the full force of the splinter breath, you all take ... "" I decided to roll the 3d6 out on the battle mat to prevent myself from letting them off easy. 5, 5, and 6. ""... 16 damage ... "" Fighter: ""I was only at 10"" Everyone: ""Yeah I'm dead?"" Obviously I wasn't eager to TPK my offshoot campaign so I decided that this victory would give Noke a taste of power. This was probably the first time he had fought a group of adventurers and maybe he found he was getting a taste for domination. DM: ""After you hit the floor, you dimly see is a figure clamber from the winged bed and onto the tower. As you lose consciousness, you see him smile and raise his cracked wand ..."" DM: ""But then you slowly open your eyes. Above you is a clear sky surrounded by the tops of trees. You notice the most luscious, delicious smelling grass pressed against your face as your struggle to sit upright. Your body feels strange as though you've been squeezed into a tube, and your hands and feet are numb. You look around to see four sheep lying next to you. Those strange horizontal pupils are fixed on yours, all the eyes are as shocked as your own - save for those of the sheep furthest from the flock. He looks at you all with resignation, and as he bows his wooly head to munch at a tuft of grass he lets out a defeated 'baa' "" Everyone: "" ... "" **TL;DR**: my party who likes role playing but is a bit uninspired in combat got TPK'd by Noke's Bed Wyrm. Instead of killing them, I decided that Noke turned them all into sheep. **Help Wanted** I now have a pretty cool opportunity to do a strange sort of jail break adventure. Given that all the party are sheep, they'll need to really use their imagination rather than just brute force their way through stuff. I'd love to hear suggestions on ways they might escape and return to their normal bodies. I imagine Noke is less paranoid than before, exultant in his victory so perhaps the defenses have lessened? Maybe there's a local druid who comes to help them? What would you guys do for a new party in a situation like this? "

The gem loses it's magic if it is ever broken or if the spells is dispelled. While casting you can instead target a gem with a creature fused with it. When targeted the gem grows in size to match that of the creature it's copied for 10 minutes, which requires concentration as is concentrating on a spell. The gem does not act on its own and requires an action to command it to, such as attack, defend this spot, or follow if no command is issued then the gem will only defend itself when attacked. The gem has the same game statistics as the creature it has copied except as follows: Being made of crystal it has vulnerability to thunder and damage. It's creature type is construct. It cannot be healed by any means, but is restored whenever you complete a long rest. At higher levels: when you cast this spell using a 3rd level spell or higher, you may increase the CR of the target by 1 for every spell slot higher. One question. What would you want to figurise the most?"
249,vulnerability,DnD,Magic item idea help. Alchemy related,1,8h75vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8h75vz/magic_item_idea_help_alchemy_related/,2018-05-05 22:15:58,"So the sorcerer in our party is a really old man who is obsessed with making tea. Every long rest or he says he gets kettle out and makes tea so I thought about having them find a magic kettle of some description. Was hoping to get some ideas from you guys. Here is what ive come up with so far. A kettle that brews and strengthens the characteristics of the ingrediant put in the water. For example if you put a good berry in it would produce a type of minor healing potion that heals 1d4 hp Put a poisonous mushroom and it would brew up a poison Some part of a creature would grant a bonus pertinant to the creature say something from a ghost, ectoplasm or whatever would grant you ethereal form for a few minutes Spider webs maybe grant spider climb Just wondered what people thought if its balanced or not. Or had some ideas of effects. They dont have to be good effects so maybe a skeleton part would give you vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Thought it would be fun to not tell the players what effect they had let them work it out for themseves. Also so its not over powered the brew only works if drunk before it goes cold so when you make it you have to use it straight away. That way they cant just stockpile 10 healing potions at A time ect. Then maybe they could buy some flasks that keep them warm for a few hours maybe? Anyway would love to get some feedback from you all cheers"
250,vulnerability,DnD,Mushroom Servant Suggestions,3,8jerh4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8jerh4/mushroom_servant_suggestions/,2018-05-15 04:47:32,"So, my party had previously tried to assassinate a giant sentient mushroom king in a settlement of sentient mushrooms they didn't know much about at the time. They failed and narrowly escaped what could have killed several characters had they not booked it. Flash forward about a week later in game time, and the druid, rouge, and monk went down to talk to the mushroom king for info. The mushroom king was able to convince all three to come right up to him before laying out that he recognized them as his would-be assassins. After a long discussion, the firbolg druid agreed to become a servant of the mushroom king that would heal the damages done by the assassination and ""spread his kingdom"". The druid then took a puff of spores to the face and coughed. So I'm looking for suggestions of what would be good things to do with this. Keep in mind that the party tried to kill the mushroom king earlier, so he won't have any qualms about putting detrimental things into the druid, but I do want the player to remain in control of the character. Here's what I've thought of so far: Aesthetics: -player starts growing noticeable mushrooms on his person -player often wakes up with tiny shrooms growing where his breath was as he slept -player develops a chronic cough Mechanics: -vulnerability to poison (to weaken him in case the mushroom king wants to take him down quick) - OR resistance to poison (because mushrooms convey resistance) -player may go into fits of coughing during battle or points of high exertion if he fails a con save. What suggestions do you have to add to this? I especially want to throw in some more mechanics effects. Party is level 9. TL;DR: what would be good efffcts to have happen to someone being forced to be a servant of a mushroom king?"

252,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Deck of Very Many Weird Things (full 54-card fun Deck),108,855ypp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/855ypp/5e_deck_of_very_many_weird_things_full_54card_fun/,2018-03-18 06:15:30,"Hi, everyone! I'm planning on DMing my first campaign ever soon (5th Edition), and I decided I'd try to make something somewhat original. The idea is to have a sort of Deck of Many Things, but mostly built around the idea of Wild Magic from Sorcerer. I wanted to balance it as well as I could around having a low level party, so I wanted to avoid high damaging or super crazy long effects, in the hopes that the players won't be too scared of it to keep using it if they want. I'm still trying to figure out the order of the cards, and I'm open to suggestions to replace some, but I have a sort of order to it. * **CLUBS:** The ""weird stuff"" suit. This is where you'll find the bulk of the famous weird stuff that happens during Wild Magic. Things like turning blue, the potted plant, and so on. My personal favorite custom addition is the Queen. * **HEARTS:** Intended to be a sort of opposite to Clubs, Hearts is healing or ""fun happy stuff"", such as unicorns showing up, equipment turning pink, adding a racial feature, and docile beasts befriending you. I still could use a few more of these, since I have a couple of filler options at the moment. * **DIAMONDS:** The buffing suit. Basically everything in this suit is beneficial in some way, including giving advantage, two actions at once, and resistance. * **SPADES:** The spell casting suit. I haven't gone through ALL the spells, so feel free to recommend any that you think might be fun to have cast on yourself or in an area. I tweaked a few of the spells, such as ""badberry"" (makes you hungry) and ""safer confusion"" (acts like confusion, but doesn't cause you to hit each other), so if you can come up with any fun tweaks, let me know! * **JOKER:** I mean, I had to have the Astral Plane teleport happen somewhere. Anyways, here's what I currently have as my Deck of Very Many Weird Things. . ***DECK OF VERY MANY WEIRD THINGS:*** This deck is found in a small brass playing card box. Opening the box reveals a deck of pink playing cards with a strange drawing of a plant in a pot on the back. Trying to turn the cards over to see the face side reveals the same plant, with text that reads ""To reveal a card, you must draw it first"". [*DM: you'll want a standard set of 54 playing cards*] Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly . Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once. If the player chooses to draw a card, that card fades away, unless the card drawn is a Joker, which returns to the deck. If the deck reaches 20 cards left, all cards are shuffled back in. **CARDS** **JOKER:** Card | Result -----|------ Joker | You are transported to the Astral Plane until the end of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. **CLUBS (Super Weird Stuff):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. It will also slowly revert to its normal color over 6 hours. King | You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts.

If the roll is even, you get older. 9 | Roll a d6. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow. 8 | You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. 7 | You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth. 6 | You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. 5 | You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. 4 | Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter int he air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. 3 | For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. 2 | For the next minute, any flammable solid/liquid object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flames. | For the next minute, any flammable solid/liquid object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flames. **HEARTS (Healing/""Happy Things""):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | If you die within the next 24 hours, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell. King | You gain a racial feature for the next 24 hours, and your appearance changes subtly to match the race you took from. If they already are that race, roll again. TABLE AT THE END. Queen | All of your equipment changes to a bright pink color for an hour. Jack | A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 10 | You regain 2d10 hit points. 9 | You regain your lowest-level expended spell slot. 8 | You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 24 hours. 7 | For the next minute, all docile beasts within 60 feet of you will flock to you as if they failed to save from an Animal Friendship spell (still requires Intelligence lower than 4). 6 | Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. 5 | For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. 4 | You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 3 | 1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. 2 | You cast prestidigitation on every creature within 30 feet of you, which makes everyone clean. *KING OF HEARTS TABLE* Result (d8) | Race | Bonus Language | Racial Feature -----------|----|--------------|-------------- 1 | Dwarf | Dwarven | Dwarven Resistance 2 | Elf | Elvish | Fey Ancestry 3 | Halfling | Halfling | Brave 4 | Dragonborn | Draconic | Draconic Ancestry (just resistance, randomize or pick color) 5 | Gnome | Gnomish | Gnome Cunning 6 | Half-Orc | Orc | Relentless Endurance 7 | Tiefling | Infernal | Hellish Resistance 8 | Human | Extra Language (up to DM) | Nothing. [OPTIONAL: DM picks a feat for character, but only one part of a feat. No attribute bonuses permitted.] **DIAMONDS (Buffs):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | For the next minute, all your spells with a casting time of 1 action have a casting time of 1 bonus action. King | You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. Queen | You can take two actions once in the next minute. Jack | For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. 10 | For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 9 | Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against the next spell you cast in the next minute that involves a saving throw. 8 | Maximize the damage of the next damaging spell you cast within the next minute. 7 | A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile. 6 | You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. 5 | You gain inspiration, or a second inspiration if you already had inspiration. 4 | For the next minute, your movement is increased by 10 feet. 3 | For the next minute, any creature within 60 feet of you make no sound as they move (even if not in line of sight), giving advantage to stealth checks. 2 | An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. **SPADES (Cast Spells):** Card | Result -----|------ Ace | You cast antimagic field (lasts 5 minutes). King | You cast comprehend languages. Queen | You cast mirror image. Jack | You cast Fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. 10 | You cast polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw, you turn into a sheep for 5 minutes. 9 | You cast safer confusion centered on yourself. However, this does not cause anyone to attack [7-8 act as 2-6]. 8 | You cast goodberry, except the berries fall to the ground. Also these goodberries are actually ""badberries"", which make you hungry, so you'll need to eat a ration in the next hour otherwise you become fatigued. Eating another badberry fills you enough that the hour countdown resets. 7 | You cast detect magic. 6 | You cast stinking cloud centered on yourself. 5 | You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. 4 | You cast levitate on yourself. 3 | You cast Grease centered on yourself. 2 | You cast magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but only one missile fires. If you don't have a specified target, the magic missile will attack randomly anyone within its range."

Has fantastic spellcasting, legendary actions, lair actions. All looks like a lot of fun. But its pretty squishy. Less than 100hp as written. Its AC isnt crazy. Vulnerability to fire is a big one. But then again, it does have some good immunities, and advantage on saves against magic, as well as fire shield, wall of stone. So Ive got some ideas on how to make the encounter work. But having never run this monster before, Ive got a couple of questions for the community. 1- in your experience, as a player or DM, how survivable have ML been? 2- Did the ML do anything in particular to avoid a potentially swift death, tactics/strategy wise? 3- How did you as DM/your DM make the fight more than just a flurry of Divine Smites and Fireballs?

254,vulnerability,DnD,"A simple slaying contract AKA, Kuo-toa catastrophe",3,86hf4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/86hf4f/a_simple_slaying_contract_aka_kuotoa_catastrophe/,2018-03-23 13:44:22,"Yesterday my University had a snow day, so my friends and I thought what a better time to play a ludicrous amount of D&amp;D? The party assembled: Sinbad Sinclair High Elf Evocation Wizard, Ichoro Shou Human Paladin of Vengeance, Skamos Lothson Tiefling Warlock Pact of the Fiend, Milo Tosscobble Halfling Assassin Rogue, and me as the DM. The party had just returned to the city of Last Light after slaying forty Gnolls in a single battle and clearing out a dungeon of Undead. While in the dungeon, Ichoro had found and attuned to a cursed crown which was causing significant hardships for him in the form of vulnerability to all physical damage. Sinbad, being the caution wizard, wanted to make certain the crown wouldn't have adverse effects on Ichoro if it was removed and therefore began to seek a pearl for the spell Identify. The party visited a jewelry store, but couldn't find a pearl of high enough quality to perform the spell. The shopkeeper then informed the party that the Beast Hunter's Guild had a contract available that could solve their problem. The party Made their way to the Beast Hunter's Guildhall and accepted a contract that was located in some caves in a known pearl-diving area. The target was a clan of Kuo-toa that they had to harvest 30 teeth, 10 hearts, 8 bladders, and 14 eyes from. When accepting this contact, the party did not know how intelligent Kuo-toa are, and planned to hunt them down like ordinary beasts. The party took a short boat ride to the designated caves and entered attempting to remain stealthy to surprise their prey. However, Ichoro and Sinbad rolled horrible for stealth and were immediately spotted by a group of patrolling Kuo-toa warriors and whips. To the surprise of the party the Kuo-toa did not immediately attempt to kill them, but tried to communicate. No one in the party can speak Undercommon, so at first it seemed the initial diplomacy had failed. Luckily, Skamos knows the spell Tongues and quickly cast it to understand the fishmen. The Kuo-toa started the conversation by simply asking what these strange individuals were doing in their cave. Skamos cleverly dodged the question and began asking questions of the Kuo-toa. The leader of the guards quickly became flustered with the questions and suggested the party follow him back to the Arch-priest of the clan. At this point Milo decided that diplomacy was over and it was time for action. She jumped out of her hiding spot and insta-killed the leader of the group. The Kuo-toa were caught surprised by the quick turn of events resulting in 3 of the 5 dying in the first round of combat, one by Ichoro's axe, one by Milo's dagger, and one from Skamos's Eldritch Blasts. One of the remaining Whips called for allies which arrived too late as the remaining whips perished in the next two rounds to a Divine Smite and a surprisingly damaging beating from Skamos's quarterstaff. Once again, seeing they were out numbered, one of the three reinforcements called for allies. At this point, seven warrior Kuo-toa came running around the corner of the cave. The second wave of reinforcement were then reduced to seven helping of baked fish by a especially high damage Fireball from Sinbad. In the remaining combatant were disposed of in the following three rounds without much issue. After the fight, the party began to feel somewhat bad about murdering fifteen relatively intelligent fishmen in approximately sixty seconds. They began to feel even worse as they threw the bodies into a pile and removed the eyes, teeth, hearts, and bladders from the corpses one-by-one. Through some decent Nature and Survival rolls, the party was able to collect everything they needed with the exception of five eyes. Attempting to avoid any more bloodshed, Skamos attempted to Intimidate the remaining Kuo-toa in the caves to give them their eyes. His speech went about like this, ""Those of you who are left, look at the might we have displayed. Know you cannot defeat us. We demand tribute from those that remain. Three of you come forward and sacrifice your eyes. Or five of you give one. It doesn't matter to us, we just want the eyes. That is all."" Skamos rolled a 23 on his Intimidation, which resulted in some murmurs from the surrounding caves. The party watched as one full grown Kuo-toa and four small Kuo-toa walked out of the next cave. At this point, out of game, the players started screaming at me to stop, I did not. The large Kuo-toa proceeded to cut the eyes out of one small Kuo-toa before putting it down. Skamos accepted the eyes and told the adult fishmen to continue. Right after that, the Arch-Priest walked into the cavern and said, ""No, my friends and followers, we are better than this! We will defeat these intruders with the help of our god! To me, to me!"" The party saw oozing its way around the corner of the cave a Gibbering Mouther approaching. In the first round of combat Sinbad exploded the adult Kuo-toa and damged the Arch-Priest and Gibbering Mouther with a Thunderbolt. The Arch-Priest summoned spirit guardians to help with the battle while calling to the remaining members of the clan to join him in the fight. The Gibbering Mouther approached the party and in the process absorbed one of the Kuo-kids in addition to confusing Ichoro. In his confusing, Ichoro began to wonder away from the battle leaving Milo completely expose. The remaining seven members of the clan ran to help the Arch-Priest, but couldn't get close enough to the party to attack them. Sinbad then reduced the remaining clan members to deep-fried fish-strips with a well placed fireball. Upon seeing this, the Arch-Priest began to lose his confidence as it was just him versus four extremely powerful adventures. The Gibbering Mouther with its Intelligence of 3 didn't care about the odds and proceeded to blind Skamos with its blinding spittle and miss the blinded Tiefing with its bite attack. Seeing her friend in imminent danger, Milo stabbed her dagger into the Gibbering Mouther rolling a natural 20 and dealing 69 points of damage which caused it to explode and paint the walls of the cavern. At this point, seeing his god die right it front of him, the Arch-Priest last all hope. Sinbad and Ichoro then began miming ripping the eyes out of their head to the survivors trying to get their point across. The Arch-Priest grabbed one of the Kuo-kids and proceeded to cut one of its eyes out. The Arch-Priest then grabbed the eyes from the exploded Kuo-toa in addition to the kid's eye to hand to the party. The party willing accepted the eyes, then began to leave. The Arch-Priest stopped Skamos and asked what to do now. Skamos proceeded to preach of Ichoro's god Meridia and how if the clan praised her they would rise greater than they had ever been. The Arch-Priest locked eyes with Skamos and said, ""You have taken all from me"" and slit his wrists. Now all that remained was the two Kuo-Kids. The party was feeling pretty terrible about the whole ordeal at this point, so they attempted to heal the one-eyed Kuo-Kid. The Kuo-Kid tried to run away, but Ichoro cast Hold Person and then used Lay On Hands to heal the wounds of the Kuo-Kid. While the Kuo Kid was held, Skamos went on to give a speech, ""You have been brought to near nothing, but you can raise again greater than ever. Worship Meridia, give your praise to her and she will rise you up. You will grow to be one of the greatest civilizations this world has seen. Take this artifact, place it in your most holy shrine. Let Meridia hear your prayers."" Skamos then handed the Kuo-Kid an iron boot, and the party left, never to speak of this again. TL;DR: My party wiped out almost an entire civilization of Kuo-Toa and then convinced the survivors to worship an iron boot. "

256,vulnerability,DnD,Yesterday's BBEG fight was disappointing. Here is what I learned.,71,88xqon,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/88xqon/yesterdays_bbeg_fight_was_disappointing_here_is/,2018-04-02 18:03:36,"So yesterday my players entered an ancient tomb where a mummy lord was resting. Inside they (eventually) found the Mummy Lord and two spirit Nagas. And they mopped the floor with them. That was an encounter level of 22, awarding 45600 XP, well past the deadly threshold of 14400 XP. For reference, we are talking about 4 lvl 11 characters. A samurai, a cleric of the forge, a sorcerer and an horizon walker. Some thoughts: * 97 hp on a CR 15 (16 in its lair) monster is low, now matter how you see it. It has advantage vs spells, but players can get past that by having an advantage or imposing disadvantage, so in the end, it's the players' spell vs the mummy's saving throw, which in most cases is a dexterity one, which is... +0. Really low. Vulnerability to fire is also hilarious, considering how common that damage type is, amongst all spell casters. * Fighters do damage. Seriously. The samurai with dual magic crossbows and the sharpshooter feat opened the fight with 70 damage to the mummy lord with just 3 attacks. * I will never ever ever again allow a long rest in any dungeon ever period. Straining the party's resources is an effective way to challenge them and allowing them to completely heal and get all their spells and abilities back is just too good, while also forgiving someone who spammed all his spells without thinking of resource management. * From now on, I will not have the BBEG fight be ""bbeg + 2-3 strong monsters"" but ""bbeg + 1-2 semi-strong monsters + a lot of fodder"". Even with legendary actions, if the monsters are few, the party can split very effectively all their offensive options. Having a bunch of lower level monsters provides an extra layer of defense for the bbeg and forces players to change their plans. I was delighted to use a mummy lord because offensively it is a powerhouse and many of its abilities also bring a lot of flavor to the table, but it just did not have enough hp to get to utilize them. Well, next time gonna be better."
257,vulnerability,DnD,"Give the DM an bit of story, watch them build amazing things with it. [Long]",6,8aehsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/8aehsn/give_the_dm_an_bit_of_story_watch_them_build/,2018-04-07 10:36:12,"Let me lead off with, this isn't a complaint. Instead, it's more more me just wanting to gush about what is going on in my characters life ATM. Warning, I may likely meander a bit and the grammar may suck, but I am sure I will reach a point eventually. Me and some other guys from the local shop banded together into a homebrew game with our DM. It has been a blast to say for sure, homebrew world complete with races, classes, subclasses, and tons of neat stuff. Sure he doesn't let us go off the rails with some of our more creative ideas but, I suppose it's for the best in the long term. He did let us get away with making Zombie Glitter Bombs and some other things that probably should never work, but I still like to personally advocate for a whole party of familiars. Meandering. To the point of it, I made my first character a Reincarnated Soul. He spent his first life being a LG Paladin of the Feywild, died in honorable battle to keep said Feywild safe, only to get his soul plucked up by the Goddess of Lies and Theater. She essentially reincarnates him into a new body, stripping away his past memories, and a good chunk of his old personality. Kept in the important bits like unyielding determination and loyalty. The race of choice was one of the games homebrew races. Impressive physical stats, but oh god the -3 to cha and vulnerability to psychic to boot. This lead to a starting stat of -2 to charisma. Straight Man to everything else the group did and made conversations increasingly awkward when allowed to speak. So yeah, lots of fun on the overall when taking in the broad strokes of it. His overall goal was simply one thing, track down various Souls from the Feywild and drag them back. Willing or No, your coming with me. Over all reason is left vague for Dm playground reasons, but when your God says do the thing, you do the thing. I always played Him as a bit resentful towards his Goddess, grateful and loyal as he is to her, he always acts like a spiteful teen towards her. Just a bit of the old him in there, unconsciously getting him all riled up towards her. Probably a complex, I don't know. I been developing him on the fly and it seemed to work since the DM played the Goddess as a catty, Mother Knows Best type. Through our campaign, it's been sprinkled here and there, he was once something else before this, all the while making him all the more reckless as he became more confused about what he actually is or what he is supposed to be. About this point the DM allowed me a class switch. I was playing one of his homebrew classes, but I felt as though I had too many options and just opted for Barbarian. It suited my needs, the parties, and it allowed me to continue to front line and be reckless, every turn at that. As we moved into the second arc, hunting Werewolves and bandits, things got real spicy for our already reckless Barbarian. We managed to find an Oracle or Soothsayer of sorts and she dropped the bomb on him. Essentially let him know his old life was stripped and here he stands now, with a nice tight leash on his soul. This did not bode well. There were some outbursts to say the least, which the god heard, which was then just dismissed as though it were a child's tantrum. Moving on and along to the final fight of this particular arc. Last stands may be the Barbarians way to go, but it certainly wasn't the case for mine. I personally don't like totem and opted for another one of the DMs homebrew subclasses. By this point, we were all around 6/7 and my feature was the ability to use my reaction to dash to an ally and soak an attack for them. I did then often and it frequently lead to him being knocked out fairly quickly. Shit ton of hp be damned, not much can be done about damage that can't be resisted. We were fighting the Alpha of the werewolves, guy hit like a macktruck and then some. I been playing suicidal for a while now, everyone at the table knew I was likely going to try and pull a self sacrifice play given the opportunity, and sure enough it happened. One of our NPC allies was targeted and she was getting some DAMNED good damage in. SO DASH away I went and ate all of the hits I did. First hit dropped me to under 0, but it's okay, it's 5e. I'm good. Second hit comes about, well fuck me. Two death saves there. it's okay, I just gotta beat a 10 on my next tu- oh it's a 9. Well GG guys. The hilarious part of this is that we all forgot SO much during this encounter. I forgot I had a Peritaph of Wound Closure. That's right. I coulda instantly stabilized from the get go. There was a bunch of other stuff, but it really was a hectic fight with a lot going on in it. The Zombie Glitter(silver) Bombs mentioned previously were used to decent effect in this fight. Lots of manly crying happened, it was great. Got a decent funeral pyre out of the deal. So that's it! FREEDOM from that Bi-FUCK NO WAIT NO I DON'T WANNA GO BACK. When I brought in my next character, a Dwarven Bard(Forge cleric 1) of Heavy Metal, It eventually gets revealed that he is actually my previous character just REINCARNATED AGAIN. Laughs a aplenty were had, I did not see it coming. Hell i even handed him my sheet just to show him I was officially done with the character, but no. I gave the DM a story, a juicy one at that it seems, and he wasn't ready to let it go just yet. Did I mention that up to this point, as it turns out, he was actually reincarnated 37 times. That's right. Not all of them had dicks, but damnit 37 times! In a Row! So, I get to thinking, there had to be an originator. There had to be one guy at the start of this conga line who fucked it for the rest of us down the line. I get to thinking and planning out a story, askingthe DM for his imout. He took care of that already. In his words 'She created the soul in the first place. Its always been her pen to write a story on the world with. There wasnt a mortal who got duped. She wouldnt trust its soul to last as long as shed need it to. Their Soul is several eras old. Most souls choose to fade after one or so.' So that's what I got going right now. I'm digesting this and wondering how to play around this knowledge. I mean, my guy knows what he is, but bless the Dwarven stubbornness, he's fighting real hard on suppressing that knowledge and keeping himself in check. So sorry if I went overlong, but I just wanted to get all this off my chest and just throw it out there."

I've come across a few tier lists for damage types in 5E, and have wondered why they exist. I think it's for powergamers, but it still doesn't make sense. Resistance is a rare feature, Vulnerability is about the same, and Immunity is rarer than both. I guess what bothers me is that most of these lists have Force near the top. Force is the damage type with no creature resistant or vulnerable to it, unless I missed one. There is a creature immune to it, the Helmed Horror. The other thing is how often it would even come up. These tier lists have poison damage near, if not at, the bottom. So many creatures resist and are immune to it. But you could go an entire campaign only running into one. Same goes for fire, the most common damage type in the game. Why have these lists of damage type usefulness if said usefulness depends on the DM? Even force could be reduced in power because of the Brooch of Shielding. An uncommon item that makes the wearer resistant to force, and immune to Magic Missle. So, can someone tell me why these lists exist? The way I see it they are useless to everyone."

It's almost all combat. All rooms are rectangular and there's only one door on each far side only going forward or back - no left or right turns (the whole dungeon is a big connected circle though). Each room is actually empty of any real scenery or monsters but a powerful means of projecting tangible illusions populates each room with terrain and baddies. After clearing a room 3 illusory images appear next to each door: A campfire (refreshes the party as would a long-rest), A locked chest (fun magical loot), Or a figure radiating power (level up). They choose one and reap the benefits before moving on to the next room. I've spent a ton of time designing several encounters for player groups levels 3-20 and making sure each combat feels unique. To add variety there will be other adventuring parties (NPC's) working their way through the endless dungeon who have their own loot they've been hoarding. What I'm really struggling to hammer out though is a way for the party to escape (without their knowledge the players are prisoners fighting in a Colosseum of sorts with thousands of viewers watching via a type of Arcane Eye embedded in the dungeon walls). The illusory rooms can't be too easy to see through (via detect magic or anything basic like that), and the actual walls of the dungeon are warded against spell damage so accidental escapes aren't happening all the time. The only outs I've come up with so far are the ""Disintegrate"" spell as its description makes it seem like it would probably negate the wards around the walls - and ""Dispel Magic"" being cast on the wall itself causing a warping in the illusion and vulnerability to damage in the wall itself. Both of those are most likely 'stumble-upon' escapes though. Any ideas for players who suspect they're trapped and want to actively find a way out? (such industrious players would be rewarded with a very challenging and dynamic boss fight in the center of all the circling dungeon rooms)."

A question for the hive mind. Our cleric used the Path to the Grave Channel Divinity feature on a monk, which causes the target to have vulnerability to all damage from the next attack. The next attack was an arrow from our Arcane Archer. The attack did 28 damage. The monk used Deflect Missiles, rolling a total of 27. So according to our DM, his monk takes 2 points of damage (1 doubled because of vulnerability). I am curious as to what other people think the interaction is between the abilities. Deflect Missiles says it reduces the damage taken, but without Deflect Missiles the damage taken would be 56. That is a huge difference. Without Deflect Missiles: 56 damage With Deflect Missiles: 2 damage The ruling seems by the book, but the intent of Deflect Missiles is to reduce the damage by 27 in this case. But it is instead reducing the damage by 54. It is what it is. The game continued on. But a lot of players at the table were upset (the encounter seems designed for us to not be able to kill this monk, as it has an AC of 27, proficiency in all saves, we have disadvantage on all our attacks against it, etc.). So as a DM myself, I want to avoid this awkward situation altogether."

Almost everyone chose weapons but I didn't want to simply just give these item +1 or an etra damage dice so I decided to try and shape these items around their play style. -- I'd love some feedback on these to see if they are interesting enough and relatively balanced. -- Shadow Step Dagger  For rouge To hit + 5 Damage 1d6 +5 A sought after dagger thought lost to time and once wielded by a demon assassin. This dagger has black smoke running along the edge of the dagger leading you to believe its not of this plane. Roll a d20 and Sacrifice your cunning action to try and shift into another plane. On a roll of 12 or higher, you vanish from your current plane of existence and appear in the Ethereal Plane. At the start of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the Ethereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. -- Staff of Pact malice  For Warlock A gift from the Fiend that you worship to bring further pain and destruction for his entertainment. The staff holds five charges, every time you land a critical hit or finish of an enemy the staff regains one of its depleted charges. Using a Charge of the staff will double the damage dice of the spell in use this also stacks with other benefits and spells where applicable. For instance, if you cast a spell using 2d8 you would roll 4d8 and expend a charge. -- Volos Bow of knowledge - for Ranger Once used by the great researcher Volo this bow was instrumental in the research of monsters and it now waits to be used again. 3 times per long rest this bow can fire a special arrow that has a chance of gathering information about the target it strikes. If the wielder breaks the AC of the target roll 1d4 to garner specific information as shown below: D1 = HP or AC of monster D2 = Resistances or Vulnerability D3 = Immunities D4 = Skills/Attacks Rolling a critical hit while trying to strike the target will allow you to pick one of these without rolling a D4. -- Dazzle +5 1D8 +4  for paladin A creation of the Holy order for the fight against the dark forces threating the world this longsword has been imbued with magical abilities that allow people of faith to harness great power. Passive  When in a 30ft radius of any undead creature the sword will glow giving the sword a 15ft radius of bright light until the sword is sheathed or the undead creature is killed. Active  The sword will produce a dazzling light so powerful it will blind all creatures in a 10ft radius (excluding the user) each turn the blinded creatures most make a con saving throw DC12 to avoiding remaining blinded. This can be used once per short rest or recharged by landing a critical hit against an undead creature, or by praying at an altar of the sun god. -- Dunbars ring of revenge  for Barbarian DunBar was known far and wide for his tenacity and his ability to always bounce back from bad situations this ring certainly seems to back this up. Once per Long Rest If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken. On a success, you regain 10 HP and automatically roll advantage against the creature that tried to kill you. -- All feedback is welcome I'm new to DM'ing and want to give each player something unique that feels like it was made just for them and allows them to have more options for their playstyle/class.

So here's how it all went down. We were in this tower outside of the City of Brass, trying to defeat this evil wizard guy who was turning people into cyborgs. In the tower we ran into an umberhulk by this machine that had spit out a dead cyborg lady, who I promptly raised as a zombie minion. At the beginning of the fight, the machine grabbed the rogue and I and pulled us into it. We were paralyzed and had no way of getting out. My zombies, I had a total of three, following their orders to protect me, began trying to rip apart the machine. They kept missing, though, since my rolls were terrible. They eventually got pulled into the machine as well. After the fight, the fighter looked into the machine to see my zombies being dismembered. The party decided to let the machine run its course and the cleric was prepared to resurrect in case of the worst. After a few minutes the rogue and I were spit out of the machine. We came out with metal plates riveted to our bodies. The rogue came out with two extra arms, a breath weapon, and a resistance to electricity. One of his arms can shoot very large metal spikes. My kenku came out with serrated teeth on his beak, a breath weapon, and beautiful feathered brass wings that function. The fighter and druid saw how awesome we turned out and jumped in the machine willingly. The druid came out with a metal grate for a nose that gave her a fantastic tracking bonus, metal plates, and a scorpion tail that can be poisoned. The fighter came out with lenses for eyes that give him super darkvision, a velociraptor tail that can be used to attack, a breath weapon, and metal plates. The cleric wanted modifications too, but knew that her new power granted by her god would get ruined. She was once a gold dragon, you see, but was too much of an asshole so Bahamut cast her out as a human cleric to repent. After spending 50 years in hell after Tiamat ate us, Bahamut granted her the ability to turn into a gold dragon again, but only three times, and only for an hour. She didn't want to risk losing that ability. We are all thrilled with the results. Aside from our vulnerability to rust."

We play pretty lax, and one player wanted to pray for something to happen, so I said they could pray as an action and a nat 20 would bring something good. I planned on a nat 20 bringing an unconscious player back to half hit points, but when they rolled it I decided to end the session and post a vision in the messenger group chat. Here it is! Veris is the one who reached out in chat, and this is the viewpoint of everyone but him. For those alive, your vision seeps away as the world blurs white, and a final, blinding jolt steals the pain of your wounds, the smell of the forest or blood of the cave, the snarls and barks; leaving only the touch of gentle, warm wool, and the radiance of a winter sun that sears your unblinking eyes. For the deceased, you sleep in an unthinking void. It's what you see from one closed eye. There is nothing, though you don't know; and time itself seems a distant memory. And from the infinite depths comes a flash of light. You feel it reach out, grasp your formless self, and - You're suddenly torn from that place and forget your stay, except a lingering sense of terrible, shivering vacancy. The light recedes. You lie on a bed of white feather, racked by violent shivers, and your eyelids are frozen. A woman made of ice leans over you. The sun catches in her crystalline form, refracting. She grins. Her voice cracks, a sharp, high pitch. ""Potential... that must be it."" Images flicker through your mind as memories. A loud shout, a squeak. Two cages holding two worgs, and a tiny goblin fumbling with the key to unlock them. The doors swing open. Her laugh cuts like a blade. ""Potential. This?"" Again, faint impressions. A team of glorious heroes, renown throughout the world. A massive explosion erupts an eldritch abomination, blasting it to bits. A grin creeps across her crystal face. ""Ohh..."" ""I see. Then it must not be wasted."" She offers her hand down to you. ""A life for your lives."" Suddenly you feel that her offer's been taken. The light, shining through her like crystal, again becomes blinding. You wake to find yourself flat on the ground, legs straight, and your arms and fingers spread. Your companions are similarly placed, and combined you resemble a six-pointed snowflake. Veris is curled into a ball in the center. His skin is a deathly blue. He breathes sharp, sudden breaths. (end.) Veris now has resistance to cold damage and the ability to cast certain spells (beginning with Ray of Frost at level 1), but has fire vulnerability, can be bent to Auril's will, and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw after a long rest or regain only half of his hit points and hit dice."

You have disadvantage on checks made to swim and Acrobatics checks. If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, you are heavily encumbered. Your speed decreases by 20 feet. You have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution. 2. Swimming in Armor. Swimming while wearing medium armor increases the DC by 5. Swimming while wearing heavy armor increases the DC by 10. 3. Opportunity Attacks. Actions that take your focus away or cause you to let down your guard give enemies a chance to make an opportunity attack. Some examples include drinking a potion, reloading a crossbow or sling (Cross Expert feat avoids the opportunity attack), and interacting with a complex object (lock, trap, puzzle, machine mechanism). 4. Rolling Hit Dice. When you gain a level and roll your classs hit die, you gain a minimum of half of the die (3 for d6, 4 for d8, 5 for d10, 6 for d12) (plus your Constitution modifier). 5. Ability Scores. When you generate your ability scores using the rolling method, add all of your modifiers together. If they total below +4, re-roll. If they total above +8, adjust some of your scores in order to reach +8. 6. Magic Throwing Weapons. If a weapon has the thrown property and is magical, it returns to the owner after the attack. 7. Critical Hits. When you score a critical hit, you deal maximum damage for that attack, plus an additional damage die. 8. Vulnerability. Vulnerability causes the target to take 50% more damage (not double damage). 9. Great Weapon Fighter/Sharpshooter Feats.

These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts. Once you use this invocation, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long Once you are encased in ice for the rest of that turn does it prevent you from taking dmg until you are free again?"

The creature has vulnerability to all damage on the next attack that hits. My fellow players went crazy like I threw some chum in the water for them wanting the next hit. The Paladin rolled a nat 20 and dealt 66 damage at level 2 on the BBEG. It was epic! I'm now known as the Alley-oop Cleric.
270,vulnerability,DnD,The tale of a Wild Magic Sorcerer and a failed animal handling check,3,7t7x69,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7t7x69/the_tale_of_a_wild_magic_sorcerer_and_a_failed/,2018-01-27 08:41:29,"So this happened in my last session, and I thought I'd share. TL:DR at the end. To preface, I was a disgraced noble, traveling through a rather large town on my way to my irrelevant destination. I decided to risk going to a magic item shop, hoping for a bag of tricks (my favorite). Turns out the shop keep recognized me as being hunted by the church, (another irrelevant bit of backstory), and called the very large and intimidating NPC paladins to apprehend me. I only noticed when they appeared in the doorway, and thus a chase scene ensued. I cast invisibility and managed to get past them only taking one AoO, and then ran around the corner. Even after rolling a crit stealth check, they were able to find me with a spell, and I knew I had to run for it. Now, I was fairly confident in my escape, as I had an ace up my sleeve, or rather, ON the sleeve of my cloak of many things. I threw my raptor patch down, and hopped on, using my dash to get as far as I could. As I stated my intentions, my blood chilled as I heard my DM say, ""Actually, roll animal handling for me"". I rolled my d20, hoping for whatever I need to successfully escape. Then, I heard my DM exclaim ""ooh, tough luck. But you know what, I think this situation could use a little, chaos. (I don't know how to do italics but this is what I would use it on) So he gives me tides of chaos so I can re roll my animal handling check, and then I pull out my percentile dice for the wild magic surge table. I hold my breath as I toss the dice, hoping for invisibility or some benign effect. The party leans in, and beholds my roll. The number 01 peers back. I sigh as I grab 9 more sets of percentile dice, and roll all of them at the same time. The DM looks about them, having decided that he will decide the order in which the effects occur. He calls out. ""You teleport 60ft in a direction of your choice. A unicorn appears beside you. A modron appears on top of the unicorn. 4 peasants are killed by lightning. 6 magic missiles streak outwards, also striking peasants. You are able to teleport up to 20 ft every turn as a bonus action, but im gonna force you to do it against your will. You are a potted plant for 6 seconds. You teleport to the Astral Plane, but come back after 6 seconds. Youre blue now, thats your self inflicted attack. At this point im feeling relief, because eve if the last roll is 7-8(You cast fireball as a 3rd level spell centered on yourself), I should survive it. My DM looks at the last pair of dice as he smiles, and says Time for another 10 rolls. I groan, but roll all 20 dice again. This time, the effects end up slightly worse. The DM once again looks them over, and starts dictating to the rest of the room. You cast levitate on yourself. Youre gonna glow for a minute. Your are invisible. Roll for fireball damage. At this point, Im fairly certain Im going to fall unconscious, as this is a 6th level sorcerer, with 38 max HP. I roll my 8d6, and my dex save to reduce the damage to a half. Now, i dont remember the exact rolls, but the fireball dealt about half of my remaining health, because i succeeded on my dex save. The DM continued. You kill 18 peasants as you fireball yourself in the town square. Another unicorn appears beside you. For the next minute, whenever you attempt to speak, pink bubbles float out of your mouth instead of any sound. You, 7 peasants, and a guard gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute. You regain a 1st level spell slot. You are immune to intoxication by alcohol for *rolls some dice* 7 days. And finally, roll fireball damage. I dejectedly get my d6s out again, ready to fall unconscious, making escape from the city much more difficult. I roll, and despite succeeding on another dex save, I fall to 0 HP and simultaneously kill another 16 peasants, bringing the total death count to 44 peasants. My nearby party members are alerted by the loud explosions, and finding my bright blue body, are able to get out by telling the guards I was their friend and obviously just another victim in the display of magic. So ends the tale of how I managed to accidentally commit mass murder in a town square, just because I couldnt properly control my raptor. TL:DR I killed 44 peasants, became a blue, invisible, glowing potted plant that teleported against its will every 6 seconds, while summoning fireballs, unicorns, a modron, and some lightning. Thanks Tides of Chaos. "
271,vulnerability,DnD,Staff of the Reptile King (Homebrew Artifact),2,7tj4tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7tj4tj/staff_of_the_reptile_king_homebrew_artifact/,2018-01-28 19:22:31,"My attempt at creating an artifact level item for the Immortal King in the Caverns of Thracia adventure that I converted to 5e. Fair warning, there is a bit of body horror descriptions in this item as I meant for it to be of a truly despicable and otherworldly nature. A fragment of an era of darkness that mankind was better to have forgotten. If you can watch movies like ""The Thing"" and ""The Fly"" you should be fine. Staff of the Reptile King This staff is solid white crystal, with 6 amethyst serpents wrapping around the length of the pole. At the very top a flat crystal disc supports 4 garnet crocodiles positioned mouth to tail around the edges of the circle. Inside the ring of crocodiles are 2 emerald yuan-ti abominations bowing to a roaring ruby dragon positioned in the middle. If pried off the staff these gems will be worth 10,000 gold but for if any gem is pried off, the staff will lose the power to transform into the corresponding creature. This staff belonged to the Immortal King. The first King of all reptile-kind, in the days when man was slave and food to to reptiles. The Immortal King's endless hunger for flesh and souls made him tyrant overlord of the entire world, before he was brought low for reasons lost to time. In his crypt he was remade into the likeness of death itself, a lich eternally trapped and held by magical wards and bonds placed eons ago. Artifact Level Item Any class can use Requires Attunement This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, Spell Save DC, and Spell Attack Rolls. The staff begins with 1d20 charges and has no charge limit. Charges can be expended to use transformations as detailed below. Charges can only be gained by the blood sacrifice and ritual eating of flesh of sentient mortal mammals. Knowledge of such ancient and terrible blood magic will require extensive study and the acquiring of an ancient manuscript on the subject (DM discretion as befits your campaign). The sacrifices must be laid on a sacrificial table and have their still beating hearts exposed by cutting open their torso. This heart must then be consumed by the ritual master. Any race unused to the consumption of raw flesh and blood must make a DC 13 (+1 for every additional heart beyond the first) constitution check for each heart consumed. If at any point the ritual master fails this check, she vomits up what he has eaten and the ritual has failed and must be started again. Every time this ritual is successfully completed, the ritual master gains a +2 bonus on these checks. The staff, which must be placed on an altar to the old and terrible gods of the reptiles near the sacrifice, gains 3 charges for every civilian non-combatant person sacrificed to it, 5 for every warrior captured in battle, 11 for every virgin maid, and 13 for a personal friend or loved one. This ritual requires 1000 gold pieces in materials (magic inks, rare herbs, powdered gems ect) for every heart removed. Transformations At will - Giant Lizard 2 Charges - Giant Constrictor Snake 4 Charges - Giant Crocodile 7 Charges - Yuan-ti Abomination using the staff as its weapon These transformations last 1 hour and when they end, access to this reptilian form is lost until the caster can can long rest. The form can be sustained however by using the same number of charges used to initiate the transformation again before it ends. All mental stats are unchanged. Dragon Transformations green 1-30, black 31-55, white 56-75, blue 76-90, red 91-100 5 Charges - Dragon Wyrmling with color type determined by the above values on a 1d100 roll 13 Charges - Young Dragon with color type determined by the above values on a 1d100 roll 39 Charges - Adult Dragon with color type determined by the above values on a 1d100 roll 117 Charges - Ancient Dragon with color type determined by the above values on a 1d100 roll The transformation of a mortal body into an immortal, magical dragon is vastly more taxing on the power of mortal souls. Therefore the same transformation rules as above apply here, except the transformation time is 10 minutes for every charge value spent. All mental stats are also unchanged here. If you are brought to 0 hitpoints while in a transformed state and the max hitpoints of the creature you were transformed into were a total greater than double your own normal max hitpoint total then you are slain, remaining in your transformed state. If resurrected there is a 50% chance that you are stuck in that form permanently. Mutations DONT TELL YOUR PLAYERS ABOUT THIS PART The power of reptilian blood magic was never meant for smoothskins. Each time a sacrificial ritual is completed, there is a cumulative 5% chance that the DM will secretly roll on the table below. Once the table is rolled on the. chance resets to 5%. The first time a number is rolled, the character gets power a, the second time power b. If the same number is rolled a third time, the character will go into a feeding frenzy eating every source of meat she can find, even attacking friends to consume their flesh. This lasts until she has consumed 5 times her own body weight, swelling to a horrific and grotesque size, looking quite like a large round ball. In this state she is treated as being encumbered. She will then retreat to the safest place she can find to digest, which will take 24 hours of uninterrupted sleep. At this point her flesh will begin to fall away in chunks (like that scene in the end of ""The Fly"") revealing a reptilian/mammalian hybrid, horror slick and slimy, with humanoid, mammalian eyes, holes in the face for a nose, slits for earth and a mouth full of razor sharp teeth, as well as scales colored according to the last dragon she transformed into. If the dragon transformations were never used, the scales are gray. This hybrid has at will Telekinesis and a movement speed of 50 feet per round and a flying speed of 60 feet per round. I leave other specifics up to the DM as for powers conferred onto this horrible creature that should not exist. At this point the the player is an NPC and should be removed from play as a villain scheming the return of the glory of reptile kind. The hybrid should be extremely intelligent, fast, and strong and should have most of the beneficial powers on the table below. The hybrid will also retain the class skills it had during its time before the mutation. Roll 1d6 1. a. as an action, stare into the eyes of a creature within 30 feet. That creature must make a DC 18 wisdom save or become charmed by you. The creature has advantage if its allies are fighting you. b. same as above except now the creature is dominated. 2. a. grow razor sharp talons, unarmed melee attacks deal d8 damage. b. any creature struck by your talons must make a DC 18 constitution save or become sickened. 3. a. grow a forked tongue. your original tongue falls out. You have advantage on all perception checks based on smell. b. you can smell the fear of your prey. all intimidation, [ersuasion, and insight checks are made with proficiency and advantage. 4. a. all your body hair falls off and your flesh becomes tender and soft. You gain vulnerability to all physical damage. b. anyone attacking you with a melee attack must make a DC 18 dexterity saving throw or be splashed with your acid blood. Save for half of 5d6 acid damage. 5. a. You swell to enormous size. You become large, although most of it is fat. Your flesh is gray and swollen and you lose 10 feet of movement. you gain the ability to unhinge your jaw and swallow creatures of small size or smaller as per ""swallow whole"" b. if the creature you have swallowed dies in your stomach, you can, as an action, vomit up the corpse in a 10 foot cone in front of you. Every creature must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 bludgeoning damage and 3d6 acid damage. 6. a. you gain a projectile tongue attack, launching your sticky tongue from your mouth. Make an attack roll on a creature within 30 feet. If the attack hits they must make a DC 18 strength save or be pulled 10 feet towards you every round. As an action the creature can attempt to free itself. If in possession of power 5b, a small or smaller creature pulled within 5 feet is automatically swallowed, no saving throw. b. you gain the ability to change the color of your skin in accordance with your surroundings. Advantage on stealth checks based on sight. This also is the first post of my new blog, where I hope to homebrew some more weird and awesome magic items URL"
272,vulnerability,DnD,When a quiet night at home becomes the civil war weve all been waiting for,41,7ukd6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7ukd6g/when_a_quiet_night_at_home_becomes_the_civil_war/,2018-02-02 04:30:01,"The Players: The half-Dragonborn half-Tiefling Barbarian with a singular mission to be evasive and suspicious of everyone he encounters (played by my husband) The socially awkward human wizard who is impossibly polite but utterly clueless about most social encounters (played by my son) The obnoxiously sweet gnome ranger with a hot temper and a speech tic (played by my daughter) The Barbarian and the wizard had been at each others proverbial throats ever since they met. Barbarian doesnt trust wizards, wizard doesnt like rude people. One night, the intrepid adventurers returned to their home to rest after a grueling mission and to prepare for tomorrows harvest festival/flea market. The wizard retired to his room to copy a spell hed found, and the ranger and the barbarian set to work finding items in their recently-acquired manor to sell at tomorrows fair. Everything seemed pleasant enough, until they retired for the evening. The ranger, who had recently been shocked by her willingness to risk her life for material goods, had made the decision that she would no longer sleep in this opulent manor and would instead spend her nights camping in the woods near the house. Unwilling to share this vulnerability with her new friends, she decided to sneak out in the middle of the night. The barbarians keen perception picked up on her movement and waited until she left the house. Then he locked the door behind her. The wizard, who had emerged from his study to fetch a midnight snack, saw this happen and became angry with him for locking out their friend without hearing her side of the story. He flung the door open and followed her out. He searched and searched but his poor tracking skills led him nowhere. While he was gone, the barbarian, ever suspicious even of his friends, locked the door behind him too, then laid down against it to prevent re-entry. When the wizard returned, he was able to crack it enough to get his wand through, and cast Light directly into the barbarians face. Barbarian responded by whacking the wand with the flat of his hand axe. So, obviously, the wizard cast Thunderwave. Barbarian failed his saving throw, took some minor damage and was pushed back 10 feet. The wizard entered, and was faced with an enraged barbarian. After days of the two heavily nursing their deep distrust of one another, the pot finally boiled over. Wizard took initiative and blasted his opponent with Witch Bolt, doing a solid chunk of damage to the hulking Dragonborn/Tiefling. Barbarian made two mighty blows with his great axe and dropped the human to the floor, unconscious. Barbarian immediately fed wizard a potion, and wizard raced upstairs to pack, intending to leave and never return. The ranger, alerted by the sound of the Thunderwave, had taken off running and finally arrived to see the barbarian sitting on the steps looking guilty. A long and painful conversation ensued during which grievances were aired, accusations were cast, and, eventually, apologies given and accepted. Barbarian had newfound respect for the wizard and the wizard had found his voice in the group for the first time. We ended the game early. Everyone hugged and we ordered pizza. It was the first time anyone had done any real RPing in our game and it was awesome. Moral: sometimes you have to allow a little careful PvP action for character development. Also, play D&amp;D with your kids because it is amazing. "
273,vulnerability,DnD,Mage Tower Shenanigans,1,7x3z1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7x3z1y/mage_tower_shenanigans/,2018-02-13 08:00:08,"So I'm a relatively new DM - first campaign and only 5 sessions in. And for my fifth session, my players decided to investigate a mage's tower they heard about. Things went...well they went, haha. They found out the location of the tower and headed off, and I knew the night was going to be interesting from the get when I tried to introduce Hobble, the traveling Goblin Merchant. Party hid from him at first, so I rolled to see if Hobble would spot them...Hobble ended up tripping and falling (first nat 1 of the night), and then getting stuck under his backpack because it was too heavy (nat 1 part 2). Everything went downhill for poor Hobble there, as the Ranger in the party sent his ape, Bud, to go and steal the poor guy's bag! Well, nat 1 part 3, Hobble did not notice as Bud gingerly lifted the bag off of Hobble and darted back to his Ranger. As Hobble was realizing he was no longer pinned and started to panic looking for his bag of goods, the Ranger takes some berries and smears the juices on the bag, writing his name on it in big letters, before walking up to talk to Hobble. After a brief chat (and a 12 vs 3 deception roll to convince Hobble of the bag's ownership) the Ranger offers to sell Hobble his own stuff! Hobble, not realizing, buys it...and completely fails the negotiations, paying 10 gold to buy back all the stuff he owns! Party says some hasty goodbyes to Hobble and set off for the tower, finding it hidden from view by an illusion, and as the sun was setting, they decide take the long rest and set out in the morning. The Druid in the party, realizing he can, decides to talk to Bud, the Ranger's Ape, and starts some existential crises in poor Bud, which ended in Bud wondering if he's a slave or not. Morning comes along, and the party enters the illusion, finding themselves in a charred field at sunset, smoking craters littering the landscape as a tall, pristine white tower floats - yes, floats - in the air above them. Party makes their way there, and encounters the first obstacle of the tower...the Flying Fireball Felines!! Kittens wearing enchanted capes zip and zoom across the sky, dropping fireballs beneath them as they go, harassing are heroes' every step as they make a mad dash to the tower...or so was the intent. Unfortunately, these are KITTENS, just kind of dropping the fireballs, yeah? So uh...accuracy, haha, and a low DC to avoid the ones that DID land near them, resulted in the party not actually getting more than singed on the way. They throw their ropes up, and climb climb climb, they're in the tower yard, where the kitten's fireballs won't fall. At this point, all but one of them decides that this should be an easy session if flying kittens are all they have to worry about. The one that didn't agree stated a lovely point - flying kittens means crazy wizard means some weird shit about to go down. So they enter the Mage's Tower, and find the Mage's apprentice locked away in the basement. After helping free him, he enlists their help in his newest project...the restorations of a Warforged monk (another player character) he found! They get him up and working, and start asking the apprentice questions about the tower. The apprentice gives them the layout, and tells them to be careful of Sequillic, the tower's owner, because he's been a bit out there ever since he brought back this strange time piece from Bellwater, the capitol of the country the party's exploring. Party thanks him and starts heading up the tower, with the apprentice telling the Warforged Monk, (the party named him ""Linux"") to go with them and help them out. As the party climbs the tower stairs, strange runes along the walls start glowing brightly, and a thick fog sweeps in, blinding all of them. When the fog clears, they stand alone in a small room, 10ft by 20ft, with a horrible figure in front of them, sickly gray skin pulled tight across emaciated features, lifeless black eyes staring back at them from sunken sockets, pus-filled lesions across their flesh filling the air with a horrid scent as combat started! As they each square off against their opponents, making Intelligence saves at the start of every turn, raining painful blow after painful blow upon the undead before them and receiving such blows themselves, the Warlock's turn comes. In true Warlock fashion, he Eldritch Blasts the undead before him, searing white energy (celestial warlock) forming in his hand as he lashed out, arcing forward and slamming into the chest of the undead in front of him, and ends his turn. Next turn, the undead before the Druid takes its turn...and raises a hand, gathering searing white energy into it before lashing out, sending it arcing forward and slamming into the Druid's chest. Druid nat 20s his save, and his character gets to realize what everyone else just did. They've been fighting each other this entire time. In response, the Druid Wildshapes into a bear and flips off the Warlock what Eldritch Blasted him, because...reasons I guess? Warlock makes his save, illusion ends, and the two of them wait for the illusion on the rest of the party to fade before moving on...not even bothering to try and shout out and explain anything to those that aren't making their saves. Done with the trap room, the party moves up through the tower, and finds my next trick: the tower laboratory. The doors seal as they enter, and they find an inscription telling them ""All take one, and the path shall open."" Looking around the room, they find potions, one for each of them, and take a seat at the table, throwing them back. Ranger drinks a potion of poison, succeeding on the save. Druid takes a potion of dimunization...immediately shrinking to the size of a fairy, as he was already a halfling. Dwarf takes a philtre of love, and falls for the now fairy-sized Druid, and spend the rest of the session with the Druid on his shoulder, protecting him from harm. The Warlock drinks a potion of longevity...and is aged backwards to 13 years old. Monk takes a potion of (unintended) fire breath, and now spews fire anytime he tries to speak. Bud the Ape drinks a potion of force vulnerability and turns green. Laughing at their current state of affairs (and making one too many ""papa dwarf"" and ""call me daddy"" jokes) they carry on! I'll continue in another post, as I feel this one is getting long."

Some of the sources are glyphs that activate magic defenses. In the alchemy lab, one of these glyphs will cause all of the bottles and vials on the nearby potion rack to rise and fly at the party. A dex save will follow, and the ones who fail will be hit by a bunch of different potions, which should have a bunch of fun and crazy results. I need help coming up with those crazy results. Its a party of first levels, and there are a couple of fights coming up for them, so I'm not really looking for damage or any really debilitating effects. More stuff that could lead to interesting situations and could even be used to their advantage with enough creativity.

If they die after that, they are corrupted into the wandering monsters in the dungeon. Im making lists of both positive and negative mutations that can make it fun and interesting. Im thinking of multiple tables, for a progression of the effects. Some ideas: Skin becomes hard and crystallized in patches, giving a +2 AC, but a vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. Natural Breath weapon Grow claws, natural weapon Runes transcribed on arm, when read it casts a spell, but the runes burn off the arm and cause damage. Any ideas? "

The goal is to use Cleric of the Grave's Channel Divinity to curse an enemy to give them vulnerability, while also taking an attack action in the same turn and using the Feat that allows me to take a penalty of -5 to Hit, in exchance for +10 Damage. My sequence would be as follows: 1. Curse the Foe with Cleric of the Grave's Channel Divinity (Action, 2nd Level Cleric, Xanathar's Guide) 2. Use Samurai's Fighting Spirit to grant self Advantage on the attack roll, if I'm not already presented with advantage by some other means (Bonus Action, 3rd Level Fighter, Xanathar's Guide) 3. Action Surge to regain action (Free, Second Level Fighter, PHB) 4. Attack using Greatsword/Maul/Heavy Thwacky Hit-stick, using the Great Weapon feat to take the penalty and increase damage 5.

Shower after the innevetable explosion of their body taking, if my calculations are correct, anywhere between 34 and 82 damage assuming standard, nonmagical gear and a +3 Modifier in Strength. There's a lot of cross class stuff going on here, and from what I can gather it looks like it'd all be free to work out in sequence on a single turn, but just to be safe I'd rather get a second opinion on the rules before I go try it. In total the character requires 2 levels in Cleric, Paladin, and Fighter. 3 Fighter if using the Samurai feature, though. Am I clear? Or have I overlooked something? EDIT: Thanks folks! I'd say this one is chalked up to ""It works, but double check with your DM just to be sure"" Hilariously poor decision making, AWAY! "
277,vulnerability,DnD,Review my dungeon,1,7lsfwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7lsfwx/review_my_dungeon/,2017-12-24 12:31:51,"[Image in comments] I created my first dungeon for my players who consist of a level 6-5 drunken monk, revised Hunter ranger, abjuration wizard/knowledge cleric and lore bard. It's a tomb of a dwarven artificer called Girnir Ironbull III. A recurring trap I have is a poison dart trap that has a 17 perception/investigation DC to find and deals 1d4 piercing damage and then 2d10 poison damage or half that on a successful constitution save DC 15. The players enter it through a corridor in which there is a poison dart trap before the door. The door is locked but the players have the key. It leads to a large room with a statue of Girnir Governor in the centre, a door on the opposite end, and 4 empty pedastools. I'll call this room 1. There are two corridors going off on either side of this room. The idea is that the players must recover 4 ruby statues and place them on the pedastools to continue. The corridor on the right side leads them into an ambush against 4 drow (should be easy enough) they are guarding the first ruby statue. The corridor on the left splits off to two rooms. One contains a chest mimic with a ruby statue in it. The other is the statue on a rug of smothering and two flying swords mounted on the wall. Now that the players have 3 statues, they will be wondering where the last one is. After a successful investigation of the walls of room 1 the players will learn it's a hollow wall, once the brazier is pulled, it'll open up to a long corridor that slopes up. There's a ruby statue on a pedastool at the end of the winding corridor. After a weight is lifted from the pedastools without being replaced (DEX DC 15), a boulder trap will trigger. The boulder rolls initiative against everyone in the corridor with a +8 bonus on its turn it moves 60ft (which is the length of the corridor) in a straight line. If it enters another creatures space, they must make a DC 15 save or take 10d10 damage. After they take all the ruby statues the door in room 1 opens. This leads into a room with A helmed horror and 2 animated armors. We'll call this room 2. There's a large door on the far side of this that is pushed into the ground. There are two corridors on either side of room 2. The corridor on the left has a poison dart trap. Before turning into a small room with lever 1 and a drow mage (who's carrying a minor magical ring). This lever opens the door. The other corridor going off room 2 leads to a puzzle door with a 5 number lock with the puzzle: The brow of the beast, The lights in the dark, The men at the feast, Beneath the armor the marks, How many? The answer is 72165 as there is the number 7 on the iron bull boss, 21 bronze braziers in the dungeon, 6 men burried at the feast room and 5 marks on the floor in the room with the animated armor. But the players won't know all this yet. Behind the puzzle door is lever 2. Back to room 2. The main door opens after lever 1 is pulled, and leads to a poison dart trap and into a room with 6 coffins placed around a feast. There are 2 doors in this room, one unlcoked one opposite the enterance, one locked one to the left. The unlocked one leads them to the final boss, a mechanical bull, Girnir Ironbull's finest creation. It's just a Gorgon with fire immunity and immutable form but lightning vulnerability. Once it dies it'll reveal the number 7 to be etched into its forehead. This will give the party to solve the puzzle door and activate lever 2 to open the door to the main tomb room. This has the treasure: * items worth 600g * 1359 GP *118PP *4449SP *581CP So whaddya think? I know it's been a lot to read but I appreciate any feedback.

Does the description and special abilities match the mechanics? Are there errors in the stat blocks? A major chaos surge blasts through the region, affecting an Uncontrollable Transformation spell just being cast. An unsuspecting Nkosi stands affected by this event and spell, with the result showing greenish hue furry skin, and a new uncontrollable chaotic nature . This shapechanger now delights in its unpredictability spawning fear, and confusion wherever it goes. It relishes adding more abilities from each defeated foe as its might grows, but fortunately it does have a secret vulnerability.

Each shapechange is fueled by the nature of chaos, so it must be chosen randomly from one of its defeated foes; roll a d8 and choose; Dau, Drake (Ash), Firebird, Giant Flab, Mngwa, Myconid Deathcap, Ratatosk, Serpopard. Once it transforms, it gains all the new hit points, abilities, skills, class, race, languages, saves, and spells, if applicable and able. The Predathon does not regain any of its original abilities when shapechanged. If its reduced to 0 hit points, then the creature is returned to its original form with any extra damage added to the original forms hit point total. The Predathon can choose whether to hold, drop, or wear equipment while shapechanging. If wearing equipment then it will function as normal. The GM can choose if its practical to wear or use the equipment. When reverting back to normal form it reverts back to its previous hit points, plus any current added damage. The Predathon is still vulnerable to thunder damage regardless of the new shapes abilities. Defence by Chaos The predation has advantage on Charisma (Deception), Wisdom (Perception, Insight) checks, and on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

281,vulnerability,DnD,Custom Zombie Dragonborn Help?,0,7o6mzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7o6mzp/custom_zombie_dragonborn_help/,2018-01-05 09:54:13,"New to Reddit and DMing in general, so be gentle. Last night, I was dming my groups 3rd session in my custom 5e campaign. Fun was had, 1's were rolled, and tension was high (Lovecraftian Horror is the best when they don't expect a Lovecraftian Horror). Breif Rundown: The players were investigating an island with some 'necro' stuff going on. Yada yada they find out some guy was working on a custom resurrection potion and party steals it. BBEG comes and a large fight goes beautifully wrong with the BBEG dying at the same time as the parties Bronze Dragonborn Barbarian. I did not intend for any of my players to die in this fight, but dice lay where they land. Now, here is the problem. I always hated when after a PC died, the other teammates would instantly find ""the magical doohicky"" to bring them back to life. I don't like babying my players. I want the fear of a PK to be an ever present in their minds. But they did found a resurrection potion... so I decided what I want the potion to do, but I'd like help with balancing. Race- Zombafied Dragonborn - *I wanted there to be a big enough change to the character to make it obvious that their death had consequences WHILE still having an enjoyable character to play with. Type- Your creature type changes to undead; you no longer require food, drink, or sleep. Your body is in a constant state of decomposition and must be patched and moisturized in able to continue to function properly (think leper). Not doing so will lead to a point of exhaustion *wear and tear* (similar to going a night without sleeping). Armor Class- As an undead creature, your ability to dodge has greatly been hindered. Your base AC is reduced by 2. Speed- Your base move speed is now 20ft. Senses- You gain Darkvision 60ft. Race Ability Score Changes- +2 to Strength, -2 for Charisma, +4 to Constitution, -4 to Dexterity. Damage Resistance/Vulnerability: You have Resistance to the lighting and necrotic damage. You are Vulnerable to Radiant damage. Undead Fortitude- If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, it may make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or a critical hit. On a success, you are brought to 1 hit point instead and have +1 marked failed death saving throw until stabilized. Breath Weapon- Can't be used if you have any points of exhaustion. You can use your action to expel black ichor, now your life's blood, from your mouth in a 15 ft. cone. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a Dex. saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 4d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 6d6 at 6th level, 8d6 at 11th level, and 10d6 at 16th level. After you use your breath weapon, you gain 2 points of exhaustion and cant be used again until a Long Rest is completed. "
282,vulnerability,DnD,5E Need help with balancing out homebrew puzzle/boss battle for party,1,7ofztg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7ofztg/5e_need_help_with_balancing_out_homebrew/,2018-01-06 12:19:21,"Hi there, Im going to be DMing a homebrew campaign soon for 5 friends that have varying experience with D&amp;D (barely any experience to playing quite regularly) and I wanted to introduce my newer players to the fun concepts D&amp;D boss battles have to offer. Admittedly, Im a little nervous about TPKing them on their first battle, but I also dont want it to be remarkably easy either. The concept Ive come up with is at the end of a bandit hideout, there is a strange, dimly lit room. In it are 5 candles, each placed on the ground at the 5 points of a pentagram. The puzzle is that when a PC approaches a candle, the flame turns from yellow to purple and when they step away it reverts. When all candles are approached and simultaneously purple, a wraith will appear from the centre of the pentagram between all the players, initiating combat with a chilling sigh that applies fear to all PCs within range. Heres the move set Ive come up with for the boss. BOSS DETAILS: Chilling breath: causes fear / immobilisation to all players within 15ft for one turn- immediately move to closest target to the left. (Fear / immobilisation unaffected with a saving roll of 12 or higher) Drain Soul: cause * points of dark magic damage to a single target, and restores own health for 50% of damage dealt- immediately move to closest target to the right. Immunity: Boss is immune to damage and healing unless all candles are purple. Vulnerability: Boss is susceptible to damage while all candles are purple. Im really keen on keeping the concept of standing by the candles to hurt the monster a part of the fight. The fear/immobilisation is there to enforce their inability to move, but if they can, Ill make a point of specifying the candles changing and hope they figure out the puzzle, allowing them to defeat the wraith. Obvious drawbacks to this fight are ranged attacks, so I dont want the wraith to be super squishy which is why the lifesteal effect is in place. Ill do my best to modify the damage and health in accordance to the average PC level, but as a standalone fight does this seem impractically hard, pointlessly easy or anything else? Any feedback is truly appreciated! I want to make this a great experience for my players. Thank you "
283,vulnerability,DnD,A Cursed Version of Every Magic Item - Part 1 (DMG: magic items A through B),13,7dcnvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7dcnvq/a_cursed_version_of_every_magic_item_part_1_dmg/,2017-11-17 01:18:57,"In my attempts to throw off my more veteran 5E players I DM for, I had the crazy idea to invent my own cursed version of every magic item in the DMG, so that the things they might be most familiar with, might secretly be a cursed item, not just the Great Axe or the Plate Armor, etc. which are now a dead give away as either possibly or probably cursed if they are magical. The result in playtesting with a few of them so far is that now they already are weary of literally any magic item they find. I plan to tone it back now, but the point was to prevent them from just using their meta knowledge of when they see slippers with spider webs on them, they may not be Slippers of Spider Climbing. Skipping only things that either are already cursed or already have potentially adverse effects (a double-edged sword of sorts, like the bag of beans), here is my first part of posts as I make my progress alphabetically through the DMG (possibly more books after that). The idea here that all of these cursed items look exactly like their non cursed counterpart, unless (typically, unless stated otherwise) the Identify spell is cast on them. It is assumed unless stated otherwise that all items have the same rarity as their counterpart. Note: I may have forgotten to specify, but unless stated otherwise, if attuned to a cursed item on this list, you have all cursed effects until the attunement is broken, even if you are not currently using or wearing it, or even near it. Looking to either help other DM's with the same problem, or to bounce ideas off of other DM's for helpful advice about either balancing or making the cursed items more interesting. Note, this is a first draft, planning to make a PDF with the language cleaned up dramatically for a final version once I am done with the DMG, so please don't pick apart my wording or structure too much until then, unless you mean to alert me about a potential oversight or abusive mechanic due to such wording or lack of clarity. And yes, I know it has a typo here and there, just bear with me. haha Enjoy... Part 1 below: --- **Encumbering Armor** * *appears as Adamantine Armor* * The next time you are hit, you become encumbered until the armor is removed, as the armor becomes incredibly heavy. If already encumbered, you are unable to move until removed. --- **Acid Jug** * *appears as Alchemy Jug* * When producing anything from the alchemy jug table, it will appear as what was requested, however the substance turns to acid after it is imbibed or makes contact with someones mouth. --- **Ammunition of Devious Returning +1, +2, or +3** * *appears as Ammunition +1, +2, or +3* * Using this ammunition will cause it to hit the one that fired the ammunition, unless someone has an arrow-catching shield within 5 feet, or a similar effect. --- **Amulet of Unhealth** * *appears as Amulet of Health* * *requires attunement* * Your Constitution score is now 8. It has no effect on you if your Constitution score is already 8 or lower. --- **Amulet of Proof of Detection and Location** * *appears as Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location* * *requires attunement* * Requires attunement. While attuned to this amulet, you cannot be hidden from divination magic by any magical means. Also, every time your mouth opens, a beam of light emits in a 30 foot cone of bright light (extending another 30 feet of dim light), and every time you talk you instead yell as loudly as possible. Communicating to any other creature telepathically is impossible, though receiving such telepathic communication is unhindered. --- **Amulet of Dreamly Plane-hopping** * *appears as Amulet of the Planes* * *requires attunement* * Every time you take a long rest and sleep (or meditate in place of sleeping), you and every creature within 15 feet are treated as though the Intelligence check to operate a real Amulet of the Planes has failed and rolled a 61-100 on the d% roll, causing all affected to be teleported to a random plane for 8 hours (regardless of time required or intended to rest). See Amulet of the Planes for details. Attempting to use this amulet as an Amulet of the Planes after attunement will banish everyone in range, per the spell Banishment. --- **Bound Shield of Haunting** * *appears as Animated Shield* * *requires attunement* * This shield is secretly an intelligent magic item, though chooses not to talk. It does not require a command word to activate, and is instead always active, and intends to play tricks on whomever attunes to it, though this quality is dormant and undetectable until attuned. The shield counts as an animated object with an Intelligence of 10, but cannot speak, though understands common. It will float around the one attuned, and cannot leave 5 feet of them. * A list of common tricks it will play on the player includes the following...  While attempting to sneak, the Haunted Shield will drag itself on the ground or hit objects nearby to cause noise.  While in combat, the shield will attempt to intercept your own attacks against any enemy, granting +2 AC to the enemy. It moves out of the way of all attacks against you, and does not grant you an AC bonus at all to you.  While attempting to swim, it will try to keep you submerged, and will even attempt to drown you, requiring a Strength (Athletics) check at disadvantage, DC 12, to overcome it.  At the shields discretion, it will lightly poke and push anyone you try to talk to.  When taking the dash action, the shield will make attempts to trip you. Make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 13). On a failure, you fall prone and cannot continue moving this turn, and you lose the action used to Dash.  If prone, the shield will use its strength to hold you down. Make a Strength saving throw (DC 12), to push if off of you, which must be done before you can get up from being prone.  Anything else it can think of to be annoying to the one attuned to it, it will do so. * Attempting to separate the shield from the one attuned will create a force that holds them within 5 feet of each other; pulling one away will pull the other, and trapping one in a cage will bind the other to 5 feet from that cage. Neither the shield nor the one attuned to the shield can be transported to another plane separately. If this is done, both will be transported to the same plane. If tremendous force beyond movement (a catapult for instance) is used to attempt to separate them, the user will take appropriate crushing damage depending on the force applied. --- **Iron Barrel of Imprisonment** * *appears as Apparatus of Kwalish* * After finding the hidden catch as described for the Apparatus of Kwalish, the hatch will open one side of the barrel. Operating any of the levers inside of the Iron Barrel will close the hatch behind you, and a flag will appear on top of the barrel that sprouts out of the side, which says simply Occupied. The catch will not operate any longer, and until the curse sealing the barrel is released, nothing will open the hatch. --- **Armor of Wounding +1, +2, or +3** * *appears as Armor +1, +2, or +3* * While wearing this armor, you are still granted the bonus appropriate to the armors description to AC. However, any time damage is taken, apply the armors bonus to the damage taken. --- **(Armor of Invulnerability already has Armor of Vulnerability as a cursed counterpart, so no entry will be provided)** --- **Armor of Energy Vulnerability** * *appears as Armor of Resistance* * *requires attunement* * As armor of resistance, except vulnerable to all other energy types not chosen. --- **Shield of Arrow Calling** * *appears as Arrow-Catching Shield* * *requires attunement* * Works as per the Arrow-Catching Shield. Also, while attuned, everyone within 100 feet of you is completely incapable of remembering your name, until they are outside of 100 feet away. If they see your name written down, they momentarily remember it, but they cannot seem to remember it even seconds after taking their eyes off of the written name. However, everyone seems to recall your name is Arrow, though they dont know why, they just seem to remember that was your name. * After one long rest, you fall under the same effect, and can no longer remember your own name in the same way, and you wonder if your name actually is Arrow, since everyone keeps suggesting it might be. You also begin gaining unexplainable faint memories of a past life (dungeons you never visited, people you never met). Every long rest you take after this, you lose 2 points of Intelligence. If you are reduced to an intelligence of less than 8 in this way, you are only capable of saying the words I am Arrow, and only in that order. If reduced to 4 intelligence in this way, you and all non-magical possessions turn to wood, and you are incapable of moving (or of doing anything else, really). You become unattuned to everything you possess, but remain cursed and turned to wood. * If remove curse is cast at any point on you while attuned, or after turned to wood, then you are returned to normal, with all points lost to Intelligence in this way returned to you, and if you were turned to wood, you are no longer wood and resume your original form before changing into wood. Doing this removes the attunement to the shield. *Footnote: I changed the name from ""A Shield Called Arrow"" to ""Shield of Arrow Calling"", and added a bit of flavor information about the item that I liked, per a suggestion from /u/zanash* --- **Arrow of Gimpness** * *appears as Arrow of Slaying* * Upon hitting its target, the arrow bends as though it were made of only rope when contact is made. It causes no damage, and makes a humorous noise when it makes contact, such as a whistle, a squeak, the sound of laughter, etc. After this it becomes limp until the next dawn, when it appears to be a usable arrow again. --- **(Bag of Beans already works as an item that has a chance for either positive or adverse effects, so a cursed version is not needed, unless you make it only give adverse effects)** --- **(Bag of Holding already has Bag of Devouring as a cursed counterpart, so no entry will be provided)** --- **Bag of Evil Tricks** * *appears as Bag of Tricks* * As a Bag of Tricks, except the creature that transforms from the bag is hostile towards you, is fiendish, has an intelligence of 10, is Neutral Evil, and attacks from it deal an additional 1d4 damage (either fire or cold damage, only 1 and it is the DMs choice). --- **Returning Bead of Force** * *appears as Bead of Force* * As a Bead of Force, except that throwing it will cause it to circle around and target the one that threw it, creating the 10ft radius sphere centered on the space occupied by the new target (aka: the one that threw it). --- **Belt of the Odorous Beardedkind** * *appears as Belt of Dwarvenkind* * *requires attunement* * You develop a nauseatingly odorous smell after attuning with it, which smells not unlike a dwarf that hasnt taken a bath in 3 weeks. Also, a beard grows, regardless of gender, on your face, about 6 inches long. Any attempt to shave or cut it off will result in it growing back to its current length. After each long rest, while cursed, the beard grows another 6 inches. If the beard reaches 5 feet, you have disadvantage on all dexterity based checks and saves. * The curse compels the player to keep wearing it, and removing it does not remove the curse. Removing it not only makes the smell worse, but anyone within range of the smell (about 20 feet) that is capable of their sense of smell makes all skill checks at disadvantage, until the belt is put back on and the odor goes back to its barely bearable smell. Casting Remove Curse on the belt will cause it to fall off, as well as the entire beard. The smell goes away after a few minutes of the curse being lifted. --- **Girdle of Gender Changing** * *appears as Belt of Giant Strength* * *requires attunement* * Before attuning, this belt appears to be any belt of Giant Strength, determined by the DM. It is only after attuning that the face of the giant on the belts buckle turns into a female version of the giant, and it turns a slightly pink-red tone. Once attuned, your gender is immediately swapped to the opposite of what you were previously. On top of this, the curse also causes you to effectively be charmed by anyone of the opposite gender, and you are incapable of any shape-changing abilities (illusions will work on you, but not any effect that actually changes your shape, for any reason). This does not cancel any current shape-changed effects that were active, as they are taken into account with the new form. * If you were previously genderless, roll 1d4, where 1 or 2 changes you into a male, and 3 or 4 changes you into a female. If you were previously formless, your form is now human and your gender is determined as for a genderless creature (above). If you were currently shapechanged, then resolve the gender change per the form you are currently in, not your true form (IE: if you shapechanged into a male owlbear while attuning, you are now a female owlbear). * Removing the belt doesnt remove the effects of the curse. However, this attunement comes with a unique quality: anyone can attune to this while someone else is already attuned to it. If someone else attunes with it, it breaks the curse on the original attuned creature, and moves the curse to the attuned creature. Casting Remove Curse will remove the attunement and the curse from the wearer. *Footnote: I changed the rules for genderless creatures to be determined with a dice roll which gender they become, instead of automatically becoming female, per a suggestion I liked from /u/StaresAtGrass* --- **Boots of Entanglement** * *appears as Boots of Elvenkind* * While wearing these boots, the first step taken onto soft earth will automatically cast the spell Entangle centered on the point of the foot step. This can only occur once every minute. Attempting to remove the boots, even though you are not attuned, causes vines to grab your lower legs, holding the boots on firmly. Any attempt to remove them with force causes you 1d8 bludgeoning damage as it attempts to crush your legs. However, if you or someone else can make a strength check of 15, the boots are removed, after the damage is calculated. Casting Remove Curse will cause the boots' vine effects to subside for 1 hour, allowing the wearer to remove them. --- **Boots of Downward Force** * *appears as Boots of Levitation* * *requires attunement* * Upon attempting to activate the levitation ability of this item per the description of the Boots of Levitation, instead the wearer must make a Strength saving throw of 15 else fall prone for 1 minute. Regardless of if the check succeeds or fails, your movement speed is now 10 for this same 1 minute duration. After the wearer attempts to activate the ability for the first time after attuning, the ability will now activate itself any time the wearer makes an attack, dash, or disengage action. This will occur as long as you are attuned with the item, even if it is not currently being worn. Casting remove curse will cause the boots to unattune to the wearer. --- **Boots of Blinding Speed** * *appears as Boots of Speed* * *requires attunement* * This cursed item works just as the Boots of Speed, except while the ability is activated, you also suffer the condition blindness while it is being used or until the start of the next turn when the effect is ended. Also, attempting to take the dash action will cause blindness for 1 hour. Casting remove curse will cause the boots to unattune to the wearer. --- **Boots of Unrelenting Springing** * *appears as Boots of Striding and Springing* * *requires attunement* * Taking the dash action causes you to continue moving at running speed, using full movement every turn for 1 minute. After this, the dash action is taken as a bonus action automatically every turn (and the full distance of movement must be made), and all attacks made are at disadvantage. Movement done in this way must be done away from the point of origin in a straight line from where they started each turn. Choosing to run into a wall will cause 1d4 bludgeoning damage (or appropriate damage for the object in which they collided with) and end the effect causing you to run unwillingly, until the dash action is taken again. If the player refuses to declare a direction to run in, the DM will choose instead. * Also, any attempt to jump (either a long jump or a high jump), will always jump at the maximum possible distance, and this maximum distance is doubled. If this would cause the wearer to collide with a solid object, appropriate damage determined by the DM is dealt. These effects will occur as long as you are attuned with the item, even if it is not currently being worn. Casting remove curse will cause the boots to unattune to the wearer. --- **Boots of Ice** * *appears as Boots of the Winterlands* * *requires attunement* * These boots do not provide any resistance to cold, but make the wearer feel like they do have resistance to cold. Upon making contact with snow or ice, your boots will turn to solid ice. Encapsulating your feet in the boots. Not only is it impossible to simply remove your feet from the shoes as they are encased in ice, but a Constitution saving throw must be made at the beginning of each turn. On a failed save, the wearer takes 1d4 cold damage. Attacking the boots to destroy the ice is the only way. It has an AC of 13 while turned to ice, has 20 HP, and is has resistance to piercing damage, vulnerability to fire/thunder/bludgeoning damage, and immunity to all other damage types except slashing damage. * Once the ice is destroyed, the boots revert to their original form, still attuned to the wearer, and will be able to do the same effect again in 1 minute. Any attempt to remove the boots is impossible after the first time they turn to ice, for now they are permanently grafted to your feet. Only casting Remove Curse on the boots will unattune you from the boots, which removes the grafting, and allows them to be taken off normally. --- **Bowl of Vengeful Water Elementals** * *Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals* * As the Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals, except any water elemental summoned using the bowl will automatically be compelled to be hostile towards whomever summoned it, and anyone that attacks it. --- **Bracers of Arrow Grasping** * *appears as Bracers of the Archfey* * *requires attunement* * Any time you hold an arrow in your hand, you become incapable of letting go of it of your own free will, through magical compulsion. The only way to let go of the arrow is to have someone else remove the arrow from your hand, to become unconscious, or to have Remove Curse cast on the bracers, causing them to unattune to you. Any attempt to remove the bracers is impossible, as they become magically grafted to your arm after becoming attuned, until the curse is removed. Any articles of clothing between the bracers and the arms are also grafted at that point while the bracers are attuned. --- **Bracers of Only Defense** * *appears as Bracers of Defense* * *requires attunement* * Regardless of any additional armor being worn, your armor class is now 12 (regardless of any armor, class abilities and dexterity modifier), as any other armor that is worn becomes intangible and weightless, yet still visible. Removing the bracers causes your AC to become instead 10 (regardless of any armor, class abilities and dexterity modifier), even if wearing armor, as before. This will occur until the spell Remove Curse is cast on the bracers, which unattunes the item from the wearer. --- **Brazier of Vengeful Fire Elementals** * *appears as Bazier of Commanding Fire Elementals* * As the Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals, except any fire elemental summoned using the bowl will automatically be compelled to be hostile towards whomever summoned it, and anyone that attacks it. --- **Unstable Brooch of Shielding** * *appears as Brooch of Shielding* * *requires attunement* * Works as per the description of Brooch of Shielding, except every time damage is averted in this way (either by taking force damage that was reduced, or by avoiding damage from a magic missile (each magic missile), a charge is unknowingly added to the brooch. If the brooch reaches 4 charges, the brooch explodes, losing all of its abilities, causing 6d6 force damage to the be dealt to the wearer, and to anyone else in a 5 foot radius of the wearer that fails a Dexterity save of 13 (taking only half damage on a successful save). There is no way to remove charges on this brooch, and they remain as long as the brooch is not destroyed. * Afterward the damage from the explosion is resolved, this brooch is destroyed, and the wearer is automatically no longer considered attuned to it. Also, unlike other cursed items, the wearer can unattune to this item anytime, and casting remove curse on this item does not cause it to become unattuned. Only casting Identify on the brooch, or examining it with an Arcana check of DC 20 will reveal it to be an Unstable Brooch of Shielding. --- **Unreliable Broom of Flying** * *appears as Broom of Flying* * Works as per the description of Broom of Flying, except for the following...  Any time the broom exceeds 40 feet of altitude from the altitude in which it was activated, it then falls to the ground with whomever or whatever is riding it.  Any time the broom goes its maximum speed for 2 turns, it continues moving in that direction without being able to turn, and begins spinning, requiring any riders to make a Dexterity Save DC 12 to stay on the broom or else fall off of the broom.  Any time the broom is commanded to go to a location within a mile, it will do so, but will at first go the wrong way, then return and go the correct way, but not before moving at full speed through the occupied space of the one that commanded it. If this happens, the one affected must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save (this save is made at advantage if they are prone when the broom passes through their occupied space). The broom will attempt to continue on its way regardless if it collides with anyone, as per the command given to it. --- If I make any changes from suggestions in the comments, I will give credit for the suggestion. I hope this helps other DM's out there."
284,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Are these cursed items too powerful?,1,7e78yh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7e78yh/5e_are_these_cursed_items_too_powerful/,2017-11-20 18:37:40,"I plan for my players to meet a shady magical items dealer in the next city who will attempt to sell them cursed magic items. They are currently lvl 4 and we are roughly following Storm King's Thunder. I worry that even though the items have drawbacks, they may be too strong for this point, and I want to get some other opinions. Armor of Vulnerability - Plate armor. Resistance to P/S, vulnerability to B Cloak of the Ratkin - While you wear the cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak shifts to camouflage you. You also begin to emit a pungent stench, a vile sewer like odor. Every minute you must make a DC 12 Constitution save or begin vomiting. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action. Wand of Illusionary Fireball This wand holds a maximum of 5 charges. Roll a d20 at dawn to restore charges. On a 1 all but one current charges are expended with no effect. On a 10 or higher, the wand restores 1d4 charges. On a 20, the wand fully recharges. If the wand ever has no charges remaining, it loses its power and becomes an arguably cool toothpick. This wand creates the illusion of a fireball so real that it can actually burn you if you believe in it. By expending one charge you cause a bright streak to flash from your finger to a point that you choose within range. The streak blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20 foot sphere centered on that point must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Each target takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, and none on a successful one. You may spend additional charges to increase the damage of the fireball by 2d6 per charge spent. "

286,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Character Mechanics and Elder Scrolls Enthusiasts: Help me with my wizard!,6,7i5ph0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7i5ph0/5e_character_mechanics_and_elder_scrolls/,2017-12-07 22:05:46,"If you feel as though you are good at fixing/tuning characters, I would like to present a challenge: I am playing a wizard in my roommates Elder Scrolls campaign, and I am struggling to have good combats. Because of the setting, the spell selection is somewhat limited, and I suspect this to be part of the problem. The character sheet is linked, and the backstory for said character is briefly outlined below. With the permission of my DM, I traded the Wizards Arcane Tradition class feature for the Unearthed Arcana: Artificers Magic Item Analysis, and Mechanical Servant class features (the stat block we decided on for the Mechanical Servant is also linked). Considering that it is unlikely our campaign will make it to 14th level, this seemed like a reasonable switch. Going into the campaign the party was informed that creatures, magic, and items would be regulated based on what has existing reference in the Elder Scrolls universe. Spells that are overtly banned include teleports (Misty Step, Dimension Door, Benign Transposition, etc.), magical flight (Fly, Levitate, etc.), spells which conjure physical objects from nothing (Cloud of Daggers, Creation, etc.), and Counterspell. Other spells may also have some restrictions based on this premise (for instance, I was unable to Polymorph our level 8 fighter into a tyrannosaurus because I could not provide a corollary from Tamriel with which my character would be familiar). I knew about and agreed to this going in, but with my lack of experience playing spellcasters, I did not understand how profoundly this would impact my effectiveness as a wizard. Since the beginning of the campaign I have struggled to be successful in combat. Specifically enemies get on me, stick to me, and then peskily break my concentration, or nuke me in one or two hits. Mage Armor + Shield just isnt cutting it, and I have no reliable means of escaping an attacker with equal movement speed. Over the course of the campaign, I have been downed in more combats than not by an embarrassingly wide margin. Offensively, I struggle to be proactive. Even though my DC is presently maxed, asking the particular enemies weve been facing to make saves has never felt safe (trolls, dragons, Thalmor agents, Daedric champions). Additionally, with my vulnerability issue, picking a spell to concentrate on is difficult. It feels as though combat always just becomes a damage race, and my output pales in comparison to the other members of my party. The Dwemer Spider has been destroyed in both of the combats Ive been able to use it. Its certainly effective, but the long downtime means its been out of commission for more fights than not, and repairing it has left my character entirely broke. Generally I prefer to eschew guides in favor of exploring the game myself, but repeatedly being told you come to in *rolls d4* hours led me to believe I was doing something seriously wrong. What I found was that every guide referred to many of the spells that are banned in my campaign as a wizards bread and butter. With access to Misty Step and Fly, you should be even more slippery than the rogue, and The versatility of your spellbook likely makes you the most effective user of Counterspell, which is essential to saving your party from some particularly nasty effects. Additionally, the guides made me realize that the spells and class features presently available do not allow me to take advantage of my bonus action or reaction which means Im losing out on a significant portion of the action economy. I have two questions: Firstly, is my situation actually as unfortunate as the guides seem to suggest, or am I simply being a whiny player who needs to learn how to play his character better? Secondly, what are some proactive solutions to the problems Im experiencing as a player? Is it likely a character sheet issue or a tactical issue? Are there different spells I could be utilizing to help the situation? Perhaps there something hiding in one of the supplements or Unearthed Arcana that would be helpful? Ideally I would like to function as a supportive caster who provides buffs, debuffs, and crowd control from a safe and comfortable distance. Presently my party consists of a dueling fighter who struggles tanking damage for the entire party, a bow fighter who struggles against save or suck effects, and a warlock of the great old ones who struggles to roll higher than a 10 (seriously its really embarrassing)... The dream would be to fill a role that somehow shores up these weaknesses while consistently staying upright. Thank you for taking the time to read. Critiques of my character sheet are welcome. Any recommendations and suggestions are most appreciated, and I am happy to provide any clarification where requested. TLDR: I play a Wizard in a campaign where some particular spells are disallowed, and Im struggling to be relevant in combat. Im looking for proactive advice. Links: Character Sheet: URL Spells: URL Mechanical Servant: URL Backstory: [My name is Astor Ligna and I am a 54 year old Imperial from Markarth. By profession I am the city's master builder-a confluence of architect, engineer and craftsman. The trade has run in my family for generations. I am a reclusive individual, and rather drinking at the local tavern I prefer to spend my leisure time delving through the Dwarven ruins beneath Markarth. I've had a fascination with the Dwemer for as long as I can remember, and the study of their culture and engineering has proved invaluable in my profession. Because of my direct access to the ruins, as well as the artifacts and texts in the Dwemer Museum, I like to believe that I am one of the most knowledgeable living scholars of the Dwemer race.]"
287,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] I made stats for Gremlins!,10,7jjmqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7jjmqg/5e_i_made_stats_for_gremlins/,2017-12-14 01:36:04,"Gremlins might be my favorite movie ever. And those green buggers make for great villains. So I added them to our campaign as an endangered species that lives deep in the Underdark. Some of their traits were slightly altered for gameplay reasons and some things were added due to my knowledge of their lore (I know a lot about Gremlins) but tell me what you think! What should I nerf, what should I buff, should I add more or less? And you're of course free to use these monsters in your game if you want. --- **Mogwai** Description: These adorable but savage little creatures live deep in the underdark, so deep that direct exposure to sunlight will kill them. Theyre curious, gluttonous, resourceful and intelligent. They enjoy tinkering with and destroying complicated devices, especially when doing so will cause pain in others. They avoid direct combat as their size and weak bodies grant them no benefits in battle. Instead, they seek opportunities to cocoon themselves and grow into their elevated forms. (In game changes: they eat mushrooms in the underdark and don't need water to survive). HP: 7 AC: 4 Speed: 20 ft Resistances: Cold Immunities: Poison Type: Fiend Languages: Common, Goblin, Undercommon Size: Tiny Skills: +3 Deception, +6 Investigation, 1 Persuasion, +2 Stealth, +2 Survival Passive Perception: 8 Senses: Darkvision 60 ft Alignment: Neutral Evil Str: 4 Dex: 3 Con: 8 Int: 10 Wis: 8 Char: 16 CR: 1/8 Traits: Water Reproduction: Pouring water on a mogwai will cause it to sprout new mogwai out of its back. 1 cup of water creates 1d4+1 mogwai, which become fully grown after 5 rounds. These new mogwai also have the ability to reproduce via water one day after being created. Ice or snow will not cause this reaction. After reproducing, a mogwai cannot reproduce for another six hours. Bright Light Vulnerability: If a mogwai is within 10 feet of a bright light source (not sunlight), they are blinded until they enter a dark space again or for 1d4 rounds after leaving the light source. They also move away from the source of light as if they were frightened. Dull lights (fire sources for example) do not harm mogwai. Sunlight Lethality: If a mogwai starts or ends their turn in sunlight or in the range of the daylight spell, they die in one round. They cannot move when exposed to sunlight. Gizmo Experts: A mogwai gets +2 to all checks involving machinery and devices (catapults, crossbow, trap, etc). This ability also allows them to manipulate traps to go off prematurely or not go off at all. Cocoon: If a mogwai eats man-made food any time after midnight, within an hour it will find a secluded, dark place. A cocoon will grow around its body (hp 10, ac 2, vulnerability to fire). Destroying this cocoon will also kill the mogwai. After the sunsets on the next day, the mogwai completes its transformation into a gremlin and the cocoon hatches. Runt of the litter: Mogwai are naturally evil creatures, but there is a 1% chance that a mogwai will be of the good alignment. These mogwai intentionally and actively avoid reproduction and the cocoon transformation (though they still are capable of reproduce and transforming). They also are very friendly towards humanoids, easily befriending and helping them during their times of need. Actions: Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit. 0 feet (must be on the same square) Hit: 2 (1d4 damage). --- **Gremlin** Description: Twisted sadists wrapped in green scales, Gremlins are clever creatures who take enormous pleasure in making others suffer for their amusement. They harm others by setting traps and hiding in dark places until they spot the right moment to strike. Though one gremlin is usually not difficult to kill, their alarming ability to rapidly multiple greatly increases the danger they pose humanoids. They can eat anything editable but prefer sugary foods. HP: 8 AC: 11 Speed: 35 feet Resistances: Cold Immunities: Poison, Electric (unless wet) Type: Fiend Languages: Common, Goblin, Undercommon Size: Tiny Skills: +4 Acrobatics, +3 Deception, +1 Intimidate, +6 Investigation, +6 Stealth, +2 Survival Passive Perception: 11 (Leader 16) Senses: Darkvision 60ft Alignment: Chaotic Evil Str: 7 Dex: 12 Con: 8 Int: 16 Wis: 7 Char: 8 CR:1 Traits: Water Reproduction: Pouring water on a gremlin will cause it to sprout new gremlins out of its back. 1 cup of water creates 1d6+3 gremlins, which become fully grown after 5 rounds. These new gremlins also have the ability to reproduce via water immediately after being created, thus putting one gremlin in a large body of water can potentially create hundreds (DMs discretion). The water source must be fresh water. Ice or snow will not cause this reaction. After reproducing, a gremlin cannot reproduce for another six hours. Bright Light Vulnerability: If a gremlin is within 10 feet of a bright light source (not sunlight), they are blinded until they enter a dark space again or for 1d4 rounds after leaving the light source. They also move away from the source of light as if they were frightened. Dull lights (fire sources for example) do not harm gremlins. Sunlight Lethality: If a gremlin starts or ends their turn in sunlight or in the range of the daylight spell, they die in one round. They cannot move when exposed to sunlight. Gizmo Experts: A gremlin gets +2 to all checks involving machinery and devices (catapults, crossbow, trap, etc). This score increases to a +6 when dealing with electronics and engines (for modern and future settings). They also can manipulate traps to go off prematurely or not go off at all. Cruel Leader: Though gremlins have no semblance of a society, they sometimes listen to one gremlin as a defacto leader. The leader is always more vicious and usually smarter than his kin. A leader gremlin has a wisdom score of 12, +1 to ac, +1 to all known skills and has the Lucky feat. CR: 3 Weapon Proficiency: A gremlin is proficient in all simple weapons. Actions: Head Grapple: Can only be performed if a gremlin is equal to or above head level with a medium sized creature. +4 to grapple. Causes 1d4 damage per turn and the creature is blinded. DC 12 save or panicked. Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +1 to hit. 0 feet (must be on the same square) Hit: 4 (1d6) damage. Claw: Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit. 5 feet. Hit: 6 (2d4+1) damage. "
288,vulnerability,DnD,Fallwell's Fantastic Freeroaming Fair,8,77zweb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/77zweb/fallwells_fantastic_freeroaming_fair/,2017-10-22 23:21:11,"I play in a pretty high magic campaign and in today's session I surprised my group of 5 level 3 PCs with Fallwell's Fair. Fallwell is a powerful wizard and devout follower of Tymora who sends his apprentices around the multiverse to potentially bring good fortune to adventurers. My PCs had just finished a tense long rest in the middle of a dungeon. As they opened the door of their room to continue forth all went black. Suddenly, torches of all colors lit around the room and merry carnival music filled the room. In the middle of the room was a lone apprentice wizard wearing brightly colored robes and a exaggerated wizard's hat with blank stare manning a carnival stand. I played this guy monotone and disinterested. He had done this whole speech who knows how many times. ""Congratulations....You have been chosen to try your luck in....Fallwell's Fantastic Freeroaming Fair....The only things that stand between you and wonderful prizes are three tests. One of might, one of skill.....and one of wit. Good luck"" Test of Might: The carny wizard snapped his fingers and the room instantly transformed into a warehouse full of barrels. The PCs had 5 rounds to destroy as many barrels as they could using physical attacks kind of like the bonus stages from Street Fighter. As soon as one barrel was destroyed another replaced it. I gave the barrels 15 hp vulnerability to bludgeoning and resistance to piercing. The group managed to destroy 13 within the time limit. Test of Skill: Another finger snap and the warehouse turned into an open field with a target in the distance. It was basically just an archery contest. One PC had 5 shots to get as many points as possible. I kept the rules simple and made points equal the attack roll of the shooter. I ballparked a max score of 125 points and the group's ranger ended up hitting 115. Test of Wit: After yet another finger snap the open field turned into an endless aisle of a library. I asked the PCs five riddles with a time limit for each riddle. They got 4 out of 5. After the games were finished they returned to first room with the carnival stand. There was a scoreboard set up that showed the top scores. I put them in the top ten on the board but not number one. That honor went to am adventurer named Rax Vantana. The wizard feigned wonder and handed out loot. I ended up giving out 2 weak magical weapons, a weak magical set of armor, and 200 gold for them doing well in the trials. Then the lights went out again and they were all standing in the room were they had planned to start the adventuring day. My group really enjoyed it and were excited about the scoreboard. They told me to put the tale on here and have other groups try their luck. Try it out and let's see who is the mightiest group in the multiverse!"
289,vulnerability,DnD,[OC] started a background but wrote a short novel...,4,78lzhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/78lzhi/oc_started_a_background_but_wrote_a_short_novel/,2017-10-25 17:47:19,"Ahd Forshu is from a small City called Mosstone situated on the coast of the great Firedrake Bay in western Faerun. He grew up admiring the militia and would watch them from his father's second story window above his shop whenever the militiamen went out to slay a rampaging monster outside the City walls. His Mother is human, whereas his father is a 1/4 elf faithful to his grandfather's (and so the family's) deity: Eldath. Ahd grew up a faithful follower like his father, however the singing waters were mere background noise to the spirit of adolescence his more human blood brought out. Seeking thrills and camaraderie he joined up with the village militia sooner than usually allowed by persuading the Captain that he was older than he looked. Judging by his already impressive stature the Captain relented and allowed Ahd into the ranks as a gate guard. Ahd took to his duty with absolute fervor. He stood steadfast and after some months caught the attention of his Sergeant, Sgt. Willowmead. After his first promotion to Corporal he began joining the patrols in the village helping to keep the peace. All was well for him until an unexpected pirate raid took the lives of many of his companions. During the night of the raid, Ahd witnessed his Sergeant cowardly unlocking the door to the mayoral manor seeking to spare his own life. Ahd watched as the ruthless captain cut a large smile in Willowmeads throat, spilling cowardly blood on the cobblestone. The Pirates easily sacked the manor killing everyone inside while Ahd quickly gathered together the reaming steadfast he could find. They slew the pirates remaining outside and locked the door to the manor gate. After setting up a blockade, Ahd led a group to the docks and took the pirate's boat - a stolen military cog. Upon learning that their boat was compromised, the remaining pirates stuck within the manor decided to try to cut their way out of the blockade. They failed and died nearly to a man. The remnants of the pirate raiders were imprisoned and the military for the local kingdom was contacted to return the cog. Upon hearing of the deeds Ahd performed, the Major to receive the Cog, named Matias, quickly offered a position under his command as an officer in the army. After contemplating the offer and discussing it with his family he decided it was best to join the military so he could seek out the dens of these criminals rather than wait, in their vulnerability, for attack. 5 Years into his Military service Ahd found himself at the rank of Lt. Major commanding a special task force in infiltration and reconnaissance. Though many under his command were roguish, Ahd stayed true to his strengths and preferred outright prowess over subtlety when it came to combat, though he learned a thing or two about critically injuring an enemy from observation of their sneaky skills. After a few minor campaigns, Ahd received a letter from the now General Matias. It spoke of a grave new danger near the Sword Coast that demanded the skills of his team. Meeting his primary contact he learned of the Order of the Gauntlet and the Paladin way, sensing his true calling inspired by his father's faith. Though he gladly took initiation in the Order of the Gauntlet, however Ahd was hesitant to pursue the paladin way. He determined to learn more once this assignment was completed. Disguised as a band of rabble turned mercenaries, his team infiltrated the Dragon Cult and learned of their fanaticism and culture. Ahd gained a new identity among them as Scald. He doesn't speak of how he earned the title, however with his prowess as a great fighter came renown and he was assigned to guard the cultists directly. Ahd met a draconic scholar named Ry who was being held against his will by the cult for his knowledge in dragons and ability to speak draconic. Ahd took a liking to the fellow when he gladly taught Ahd the basics of Draconic, a skill he would surely need, and vowed to get Ry out as soon as their plans could come to fruition. Once his designed trap was set his team sprang into action quickly disabling the defenses of the cultists and signaling the main battalion to move in and wipe out the cult. Their disguises were not blown as the majority of the team fled the location with the remaining cultists as instructed. Ahd, however, stayed behind with Ry in order to ensure that he escaped their custody and not be harmed by the battalion. All contact was lost with the team, however, as Ahds primary form of contact, Behryn, was found murdered. Before he died, Behryn wrote: Traitor, on the wall in his own blood. Due to the danger he was about to face, he decided to visit his family before reestablishing contact with his team, while this also gave them a chance to fully integrate it also left time for this new nemesis to believe that he was safe. He felt he needed the chance to say his peace to his mother in case his duty took him beyond her reach, and to let his father know his guidance towards the peace the goddess Eldath brings was not in vain. He owed him that much at least. While in Mosstone Ahd was approached by a Paladin by the name of Archway. After challenging Ahd to a duel, Ahd declined stating that he had seen much too much war to play at it without cause. This impressed the Paladin, as that is the real answer he sought out of the countless individuals he had questioned in his life. He offered to show Ahd the real power of his faith in Eldath, which intrigued him, so he followed. Ahd soon joined their order. Becoming a Paladin and thus eschewing his previous life as a pure fighter without knowledge of his higher purpose. His father was so pleased that he gifted his son an enchanted item. Donning the gauntlets, Ahd felt the strength surge through his arms. He vowed to only use them in defense of the peace and fortune of the land. Once more with the faith and power of his purpose he set forth to set right the wrongs of the world and finish what he started with new clarity of purpose. Setting off for the town of Yartar, he made way towards the Stonehill Inn where he had agreed to meet up with Ry once again to begin his mission. Upon arriving, Ry informed him of recent attacks on the town by apparent dragon cultists. Gaining access to the citys defense plans by way of military rank, Ahd soon identified a severe gap in resources and manpower. He consorted with Governor Nighthill and gained his blessing to seek out help from nearby Phandalin, whos more recent political communications have been one of friendship and reparations to their old alliance rather than intrigue and hidden lies in promises of riches. What better way to make amends than die for their defense. Ahd and Ry set off for Phandalin at once "
290,vulnerability,DnD,Finish Him!! [House Rule Idea],20,796bbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/796bbe/finish_him_house_rule_idea/,2017-10-28 08:49:42,"House Rule idea: ""Finishing Moves."" This is for tables where you want somewhat more cinematic fights scenes, and/or for tables where your PCs are blowing through monsters a little quickly and you want to slow them down without nerfing any of their actual abilities. Under this House Rule, enemies can still act while at or below 0 HP. Rather than being something that kills them, being at or below 0 HP gives enemies vulnerability to ""Finishing Moves."" ------------------------------------------------ **New Action in Combat: Finish** When you take the Finish action, you attempt to finish off one enemy at or below 0 HP (I say ""Finish"" instead of ""kill"" because you could be capturing the enemy, knocking them out, banishing them, or any number of other things - the point is just that you're ending their role in this fight). In order to successfully Finish an enemy, you describe to your GM what you're attempting - and use detail! This is the time to be creative, cool, and descriptive. Don't just say ""I kill the Orc."" Describe the brutality of your axe cleaving into his skull, or how you open a portal to your demonic patron and kick him through, or how you rip his still-beating heart from his chest with your bare hands! Based on what you describe, the GM will tell you to make a check. This check could be anything, based on your description - an attack roll, an Ability check, a Skill, basically any normal kind of check, using the normal rules for that check (i.e. if they choose an Attack as their Finishing Move, the attack is against Armor Class as normal). If the action wouldn't normally require a check (like say, a Cleric using Turn Undead as a Finishing Move), approximate the best check you can think of, like a Wisdom (Religion) check in that case. The point is that a Finishing Move must always involve one check on the PC's part, and none on the enemy's part (they don't get a save against Finishing Moves! It's all on the PCs!). If the Finishing Move is successful, the enemy is defeated in whatever manner the PC described. If not, the enemy is still kicking - and still a threat! Finishing Moves can be anything - it can be ripping the head off of a Minotaur with your bare hands; running the pirate captain through while delivering a final, pithy line; kicking the opposing gladiator into the Pit of Doom; or brandishing your Holy Symbol to the Vampire one last time, watching it burst into flames. ---------------------------------------- The point of this rule isn't to punish PCs or trick them; it's to create cinematic fights and slow the PCs down just a *little,* so you can get a little more mileage out of your bad guys. As the GM, you just always have to make sure to make it clear from the description that the monster is at 0 - ""The gladiator staggers from his wounds, barely conscious, teetering at the edge of the pit. With his last strength, he glares at you and spits a wad of blood at your feet."" That sort of thing. This should be used to increase the drama of their fights and allow the PCs to do rad stuff. ------------------------------------------------------- Pros: Monster deaths are always dramatic and cool. PCs get to be creative with how they dispatch monsters. PCs can't blow through enemies quite as quickly if you don't want them to. Cons: Fights are harder; every enemy requires (at least) an extra action and a successful check to dispatch. Of course, that might be your goal, AND it's easy enough to make Finishing Moves only apply to ""important"" monsters. But the idea of using this on *every* monster actually appeals to me, since it also really breaks up the monotony of fighting 20 Orcs if the PCs get to describe cool different finishing moves to each one. The biggest con I see is that a group of 20 Orcs can be *Fireball*-ed down to 0, but still require a Finishing Move for each one individually. But! Maybe that's a pro for some people? Some people don't love that AoE effects can reduce epic-looking fights to single rolls. I could still see it working - round 1, the Wizard casts Fireball, every Orc is screaming with pain while burning, and then everyone else runs through the crowd doing awesome moves to kill them. That seems cool. ---------------------------------------------- You could even customize this to each class! Maybe: * When a Barbarian takes the Finish action while in a Rage, it sustains the rage as if he attacked a hostile creature that round. In addition, if the Finishing Move is successful, one round is added to the duration of the current Rage. * When a Bard successfully uses a Finishing Move, they can grant an ally a Bardic Inspiration die, exactly as if they had used that ability (except not requiring a separate Bonus Action) * A Cleric may use his Channel Divinity to Finish all Undead within the normal area of Turn Undead. * A Druid may Finish *and* assume Wild Shape as a single action, as long as the Finish was successful and they describe how the Finishing Move involves turning into an animal (""I lunge at him, turning into a hawk in mid-leap and then clawing out his throat!""). If you fail the Finishing Move, you don't Wild Shape, but you don't expend a use of it, either. * When an enemy adjacent to a Fighter drops to 0 HP, a Fighter may use his Reaction on a Finishing Move. In addition, when a Fighter takes the Attack action, he may trade any number of Attacks for Finishing Moves. * When a Monk either reduces an enemy to 0 HP or successfully Finishes someone as an Action, they may attempt another Finishing Move as a Bonus Action. (This means a Monk can reduce an enemy to 0 HP with their Action, and then attempt to Finish that same Enemy as a Bonus Action). * If a Paladin successfully Finishes a creature he has previously used Divine Sense on, he regains one use of Divine Sense. * Rangers have Advantage on Finishing Moves against their Favored Enemies. * Rogues can attempt Finishing Moves on enemies that are above 0 HP, up to a maximum equal to the Rogue's class level (so a character with 8 levels in Rogue can Finish enemies at 8 HP or less). DMs should note when enemies cross this threshold and describe a particular vulnerability (""As he fights with his last breath, you see your opening - he's put everything into offense and left his flank unguarded,"" or the like). * When a Sorcerer takes the Finish Action, they may attempt a Finishing Move on a number of targets equal to their CHA mod. * If a creature with 0 HP attacks a Warlock, the Warlock may use her Reaction to attempt to Finish that creature. If the Finishing Move is successful, it interrupts (and thus prevents) the attack on the Warlock. * If a Wizard successfully Finishes a creature as an Action, he may cast a Cantrip as a Bonus Action. --------------------------------------- That's all!

But he has neither resistance or vulnerabilities against that. Does he take then 8 dmg total? I cant find this anywhere explained. Only when he has resistance(halve type) or vulnerability (double type). Right? So with vulnerability he takes 11 dmg and with resistance 7dmg(rounded up).

Drawing design inspiration from the black mages in Final Fantasy and the Jawas of Star Wars, the Lightless come to D&amp;D. A race oblivious to the very concept of origin or identity. [Lightless Race v.3](URL **[CHANGES]** **ADDED FLAVOR TEXT!** Now you all have a stock origin for Lightless being introduced into your worlds and how your Lightless NPCs interact with your characters! **TRAIT CHANGES** * **Ability Score Improvement -** Removed the +1 to the score you did not choose. I had to compare the Lightless to other races and felt as if I basically just made an objectively better Tiefling. This brings them back down to a similar power-level and justifies the removal of the Radiant Vulnerability. * **Age -** Reworded to compliment the flavor text. * **Alignment -** Reworded to compliment the flavor text. * **Demi-Corporeal Form -** renamed to ""Living Shadow."" * **Radiant Vulnerability -** Removed to compliment the flavor text. Radiant damage is situational at best and as many people brought up, it didn't quite compliment the ""feel"" they got from the race. * **Voidskin -** Added to compliment the flavor text. I did a 180 on my feelings about how they interact with Radiant damage after a lot of discussion. They feel much more in-line with the PHB races as a result of this tweak. "

He targets the big bad in combat and kills them swiftly, letting other take out the smaller add ones and being mostly useless once he does so. Lv 1-5 is hexblade, picking up GWM, thirsting blade, and eldritch smite Lv 6-7 is paladin, picking up lv 1 smites. Lv 8-9 is wizard for higher level divine smite slots as well as divination to store two rolls per day. 10-11 is either fighter or grave cleric. 12-13 is either fighter or grave cleric. 14 is battlemaster 15-20 is warlock. Alternatively 14-17 is warlock, going into battlemaster just makes the build ""complete"" at lv 18 instead of 17. The idea is flametounge + half orc + divine smite + eldritch smite + grave cleric channel divinity + action surge + GWM + banishing smite + storing a crit from wizard ability. The hit is something like 12d6(FT) + 12d8(ES) + 6d8 (DS) + 10d10 (BS) + 2 (charisma, lol) + 10 (GWM) + 6 (ahexblade curse to add proficiency to damage) Times all that by 2 due to vulnerability, granted by grave cleric's channel divinity.

294,vulnerability,DnD,The Demon Vials of Balathamog,2,7clye2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7clye2/the_demon_vials_of_balathamog/,2017-11-13 20:08:53,"So I am in a bit of a pickle. **Javi no leas esto.** One of my players is a warlock that has made a pact with a devil. He will hunt warlocks of other devils and trap their souls so they devils don't get their power back nor the payment the soul would be, and the player gets as payment some weird vials. The vials are a magical item I made up some time ago (I am not sure if I stole it from somewhere), that give the player temporary boosts and I need more of them. I am not sure if they are balanced (to tell you the truth I don't really care), but they all have a positive side and a negative side. So far I have: * The Truedwarf Alloy: A syringe with a bronze and metallic looking liquid moving inside it, there is a label that says ""Inject Me"". when injected your skin color changes to a more orange and metallic tone. Whenever you suffer damage in the next 3 days you get resistance to all physical damage (slashing, piercing and bludgeoning) and +2 AC since you are made of metal, but you have disadvantage on saving throws (or the attacker advantage) on lightning themed spells. Your skin turns to bronze and you are more resistant while still able to move as much as before. Lasts 3 days and the syringe refills every 1 week. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 10 creatures. * Shadow's Breath: A small bottle has a piece of wax over the top is filled with a weird floaty and vapor-like black substance inside, there is a label that says ""Breath Me"". When the wax is broken the top of the glass bottle has small holes where air can pass through. Whenever breathed in the PC gets advantage to stealth and can cast ""Gaseous Form"" twice while in this state also you get +1 AC since you are harder to see and define your borders. While in this state you have sunlight sensitivity and vulnerability to radiant damage. It lasts for 12 hours and reappears full and waxed every 2 nights. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 8 creatures. * Devil's Blood A vial filled with a red and orange liquid sloshes inside it moving slow, more jello than water, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drunk, this liquid turns you into a hulking demon. Clothes and item fuse into your form. Your size is large, your AC 14 (natural armor), your STR-18 DEX-15 Con-14, your Hp is 42, you have multi-attack and make two claw attacks(+7 to hit 2d6+4 each). You have resistance to fire damage and a speed of 30 ft. on land and climbing. But vulnerability from radiant damage and you are technically a fiend to spell effects, you are unable to cast spells that require precise movement of your hands (I believe that was somatic) in this form. This form lasts for 1 hour and the vial reappears every 3 days. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 12 creatures. * Sahuagin Slime: A vial in the shape of a fish with a transparent liquid inside moving slower than water and sticking to the sides, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drunk you gain gills and a swim speed of 60 ft. You have advantage against bloodied enemies in the water and can summon a reef shark under your control, however in this form you cannot pass more than 20 minutes out off the water. It lasts for 4 hours and reappears every morning with the high tide. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 5 creatures. * Illithid Brain Matter: A small jar in the shape of a brain is filled with small pieces of something meaty, there is a label that says ""Eat Me"". When eaten you feel how part of your lips stretch and you start to understand more things. Your intelligence increases by +2, now can cast two of these spells (with Int as the spellcasting ability): Command, Dissonant Whispers, Blur, Crown of Madness and Hypnotic Pattern. Have 3 slots; one of 1st, one of 2nd and one of 3rd level. These slots are only usable for this spells. While in this state you have sunlight sensitivity and vulnerability to psychic damage since you are now very sensitive to brain-altering shit. In this form, you have 4 small tentacles around your mouth. Mind blast action, 15-foot cone. 2d8+int psychic, int saving throw. This lasts for 2 hours and reappears every 3 days. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 7 creatures. * Incubus Love: A vial shaped like a woman with bat wings enveloping her filled with a whitish liquid it looks slimy and sticky, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drink you sprout leathery red bat wings and gain fly 60 ft. Your Charisma increases by 2 and you gain the abilities to Charm and do a Draining kiss (Following Succubus rules in MM) that does 3d10+Cha Mod psychic damage. However, you also gain vulnerability to radiant damage and you are technically a fiend to spell effects. This form lasts for 30 minutes and the vial reappears every 2 days. Unless you kill and trap the souls of 8 creatures. So those are the ones I have thought of. Any ideas for any other vials, wether it is a cool creature that I may want to look at or a cool ability that I could give him? Thanks! "

AND IT EVEN SCALES DOUBLE FOR HIGHER LEVEL CASTS. your other spell i leave to you. 14th level spells: disintegrate, and anything. why disintegrate when you have Bigby's? two reasons: first, direct damage with low saves for the gargantuan creatures and no concentration. also, 0hp kills, which is the second point: UA barbarian zealot becomes almost LITERALLY UNKILLABLE with persistent rage, but disintegrate can finish him if it lands [yes, killing this one, non-canonical theoretical character was THAT important]. 18th level: obviously Wish, and again, whatever you want. Wish is incredible for allowing vicarious casting of almost any spell, but for our purposes, Wish has two uses: Hallow [force vulnerability for disintegrate] and Simulacrum [obvious]. if you get an epic boon of high magic, your simulacrum can wish hallow, so that's cool. when hallowed, your bigby's and disintegrate do DOUBLE DAMAGE, but it might be overkill since bigby's targets can't really threaten you anyhow. 4) ability checks: initiative is one. get Alert. get Lucky. always go first. 5) strategy: since you will defo be going first, cast Wish simulacrum. if anyone tries to counterspell, pray your portent die was sufficiently awful to make them miss. if they do it at 9th level, chastise them for metagaming. better yet, cast this when out of range; there are a few ways to do this, but i recommend Wish contingency with a dimension door [obviously this contingency was cast the day prior] to get out of range when combat begins. with your simulacrum, have it cast either Bigby's if against legendary resistance [and non-gargantuan] monsters, or Hallow if against NPCs or other dex-awful characters. during your enemies' turns, you and your simulacrum can counterspell anything nefarious with your amaze-balls ability checks [assuming you're in range], otherwise react with Shield if you took that spell [Absorb elements is also good if you get targeted by elemental magic out of range]. if you're up against melee combatants, your next turn will be fun: BIGBY'S that sod and strangle them at range. your simulacrum should do the same. rinse repeat bigby's attacks until targets die, Misty Stepping as a bonus action if you took it to get out of range when necessary. against magic-users, keep you and simulacrum in range and just counterspell-disintegrate. if they counterspell you, counterspell their counterspell with whoever didn't counterspell the non-counterspell spell before the counterspell. you know what i mean. ranged characters are annoying since you can't really do anything cool to them, just take them out like anything else: slowly. 6) why overpowered? it's not, it's just better than most casters since your strategy is based on something you have a virtual monopoly on being good at: skill checks. only barbarians with rogue levels to expertise their athletics will be able to maybe escape your crushing hand, but since you can have a simulacrum do the same, and they need an action to break out, there's really nothing any non-gargantuan melee foes can do to you. casters suffer completely as well; their counterspells will NEVER be as good as yours. 7) but what about gargantuans? good question. i can't think of anything besides Enlarge/reduce, but someone else will need to cast it on your Hands, so... if anyone has anything better than this, or has a way to add to this, i'd LOVE to hear it. the way it is now, i really can't see this build being beaten in a one-on-one fight with any enemy that's not Tiamat. almost certainly going first while having vicarious access to contingency makes this build extremely hard to stop, and if the portent die rolls are good [1, 20, for example], then i think it's actually impossible for any normal character to beat you. best of all, NO CHEESE"

I remembered in Critical Role when half the group fought a Rakshasa, and i thought that might be fun to add at some point! But when i looked at the stats for it, i was a bit confused. Its CR is fairly high (13), which is on par with an adult dragon, but its health is low, its AC isnt impressive, its spell list is a bit lackluster, and the one attack it does have is really weak, with the curse being a small hurdle for a mid-level party. The immunity to spells 6th level or lower is really nice, but i dont know if its enough to justify that high a CR, especially with vulnerability to good aligned creatures using piercing damage. Am i missing something? Is there mechanics from previous editions versions of the Rakshasa that could spice up 5e's?"

But I have enjoyed reading though different post from time to time. Anyway as you can see from the title I have made a new monster (at least new to me) for D&amp;D 5th edition and was looking for feed back on it. I'm worried that I may not have the balance right for the challenge rating. Thanks in advance! So with out any more delay here is my new monster the Nine Tailed Kitsune!

Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (4d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7(2d6) current vulnerability damage. Foxs Breath (Recharge 5-6). The Kitsune exhales a magical Breath that takes the damage type of its current vulnerability (Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing or None give a piercing damage type) in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28(8d6) current vulnerability damage on a failed save, of half as much damage on a successful one. LEGENDARY ACTIONS The Kitsune can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creatures turn. The Kitsune regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. Claw Attack. The Kitsune makes a claw attack. Bite Attack (Cost 2 actions). The Kitsune makes a bite attack. Fox Tactics. The Kitsune may move up to its full movement speed. Fox Cunning (Cost 2 actions). The Kitsune waves its tails in a misleading pattern giving disadvantage on all attacks rolls made on it within 60 feet until the start of the Kitsune's next round.

From a five hour train journey, the Fae and Demi-fae (or Half-Fae) races were born. Fae are the ancient ancestors of Elves and dwell within the Seelie and Unseelie Courts. Whereas Demi-Fae are the offspring of Fae who have ventured outside the court. I had thought of just reskinning a races to suit, but it didn't quite have the flavour that I wanted. So here you can find the document consisting of everything I have so far. I still plan to write a lot about Fae culture, drawing from what I have read in the official books etc, and other material such as Dresden Files and the Sarah J Maas books. I *think* I've balanced Fae pretty decently for a first time attempt, the iron vulnerability should serve to counter the shifting (since this is intended to be mostly utility and not like Wild Shape). Demi-fae are basically reskinned Half-Elves; they have much the same bonuses but speak Sylvan and Common as standard. Admittedly I'm working on the lore but the gist is that they are Fae Race: URL And for good measure I used the guide and template provided by u/JamesMusicus and can be found here for any interested URL"
300,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrew Abyssal Sorcerer Origin,2,6woxdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6woxdn/homebrew_abyssal_sorcerer_origin/,2017-08-29 14:26:30,"Hey guys I really missed the abyssal bloodline from 3.5 so I did my best to remake it for 5e keeping the flavor and trying to keep it at roughly the same power level of the draconic origin. Thanks for reading and tell me what you think! (I'm really unsure of the 18th level feature and would love suggestions). Abyssal Sorcerer Origin: Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and alignment) is up to you. Abyssal Toughness: Your body has always seemed to shrug off blows others would succumb to. Ac 13 + dex mod. In addition you have fire and necrotic resistance but are vulnerable to radiant damage. Call of the Abyss: At the 6th level, as an action, you may conjure a demon(or demons), with a challenge rating of half your sorcerer level or lower. This costs 4 sorcery points to do so. A conjured demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 90 feet. They disappear to their home plane if they are reduced to 0 hit points. These fiends are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the fiend, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal(or telepathic) commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you dont issue any commands to the demon, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. You must finish a long rest to use this feature again. Demonic Flight: At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of demonic wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a Bonus Actionon Your Turn. They last until you dismiss them as a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You cant manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. The Demon Within: At the 18th level you have the option to permanently fully embrace your abyssal heritage and your race changes to a fiend(demonic). Your appearence changes to that of the race of demon that infected your bloodline(Alternatively, at your dm's discretion, you transfrom to a demon of your choice or a form that is obivously demonic). You lose any ability scores, and any other weakness/strengths from your former race are lost (damage resistance etc..). You don't forget any languages however. You do gain the bonuses from your new race(pick 4 ability increases if you and your dm made a custom demon form). For example if a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison. If you do not embrace your heritage the gods smile upon you and remove your radiant vulnerability. Regardless of changing race you gain telepathy as a free action within 60 yards. Edit: Clarified Demon Within, nerfed Call of the Abyss. Call of the Abyss changes: Increased sorcery points from 3 to 4, removed extra uses. Demon Within changes: Added this line: For example a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison."
301,vulnerability,DnD,[Homebrew] 5e - Help me come up with fun random effects for arrows!,8,6xhnf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6xhnf6/homebrew_5e_help_me_come_up_with_fun_random/,2017-09-02 07:34:58,"So one of my players is an unpredictable ball of chaos. As such, I wanted to give him an item that's fitting for him. The concept I came up with was a cursed quiver called the Quiver of Lost Arrows. It's description reads: &gt;Contains 5 arrows and regenerates arrows each morning until the effective arrow count is 5. The maximum number of arrows that can regenerate this way on any given day is 5, and the quiver will not carry more than 5 arrows. &gt;It's impossible to place an arrow in the quiver, and once you remove an arrow from the quiver, you cannot take any other actions until you fire the arrow. &gt;Arrows do not spill out of the quiver, and creatures aside from the creature with the quiver equipped find that they cannot hold onto the arrows to pull them out, their hands slip right off. Naturally since it's cursed, once equipped it does not come off. The other effect of the curse: Every time the creature with this quiver equipped makes an attack roll with a bow, roll a d10. If the result is 1 or 2, they subconsciously grab an arrow from The Quiver of Lost Arrows, instead of whatever other quiver they have equipped. So, no big deal, right? It's just some extra arrows. Except! Any arrow from this quiver gains effects when fired from a bow. To determine the effects, roll 1d100. If you roll a 20, 40, 60, 80, or 100, re-roll that effect and roll for another effect. Effects combined this way are subject to the DM's discretion and may not interact consistently with subsequent occurrences. I initially designed it to be a d20 roll, but I would love to come up with enough cool effects to populate a d100 roll. To give you an idea of what kind of effects I'm looking for, here's what I have right now (sorted mostly from most negative to most positive): 1. Healing - If the arrow hits a creature, whatever damage the creature would take is converted into healing, instead. 2. Indecisive- Homes in on nearest creature, which makes a DC15 Dex saving Throw. 3. Howling - All biological creatures that can hear make a DC11 Constitution Saving Throw to avoid being incapacitated for a turn. Nearby creatures are alerted to your presence and position. 4. Pretty - The arrow disappears into a Shower of Sparks. 5. Blink - If a creature is hit by the arrow, the arrow casts Blink on it. For 1 minute the target blinks in and out of the ethereal plane as if it used the spell 'Blink.' 6. Punch - The arrow is replaced by a stone. This arrow does bludgeoning damage instead of piercing. 7. Tracer - The arrow leaves a glowing streak of light in the air from the bow to the point of impact. 8. Downgraded - The arrow becomes smaller, downgrade its damage die. 9. Invigorating - If a creature is hit by the arrow, it gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until your next turn. 10. Invulnerability - If a creature is hit by this arrow, they are granted resistance to slashing and fire damage for one hour. 11. Darkness - When the arrow hits something, it projects a 5ft radius of Darkness, as if Darkness had been cast. 12. Harvest - When the arrow strikes something, the shaft will be loaded with an assortment of delicious fruit. 13. Upgraded - The arrow becomes larger, upgrade its damage die. 14. Sidesplitting - A creature hit with this arrow makes a DC13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, they are subject to ""Tasha's Hideous Laughter"" and begin laughing hysterically, leaving them prone and unable to move. They make the save every time they take damage. Only works on INT &gt; 4. 15. Earthquake - If this arrow does not hit a creature, but does hit rock or earth, there is a minor earthquake in the area. 16. Inertia - This arrow is unimpeded by creatures or drop, and will continue in a straight line until it hits earth or ground, which it will burrow deeply into. When burrowed, the arrow seems to be fixed in space, unable to be moved. The arrow is also reinforced, and will support more weight than usual. Can still break under extreme duress. 17. Vulnerability - A creature hit with this arrow makes a DC13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, for 1 hour they are weak to slashing and cold damage. 18. Knife Twist - If the arrow strikes a creature, the arrow twists in the wound, and that creature takes an additional 1d4 of damage. 19. Lightning Rod - When this arrow hits something, it channels a powerful lightning spell, hitting all creatures in a 5-foot radius with 1d10+5 lightning damage. (and then of course, 20 is the ""roll again"" mechanic) Basically, I want a range of useful, to useless, to downright negative effects. Also, no one hit kills. We run a pretty rules-loose game, but I can't have my BBEG get blown away by 1 good roll. I look forward to seeing what the community can come up with!"
302,vulnerability,DnD,Help Homebrewing Some Magical Items,9,6xo7nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6xo7nk/help_homebrewing_some_magical_items/,2017-09-03 05:08:04,"#Spoilers for Princes of the Apocalypse ahead! I'm a new DM who's only run Lost Mines before, and I'm gearing up for the final act of Princes of the Apocalypse. My party (God bless'em) has done a lot of sequence-breaking so they'll need to go back and level up for a while. While they're at it, I'm going to be dropping in some homebrewed magical items. The campaign book has some good items (especially that *dwarven thrower*), but the issue is all of our PCs are pretty idiosyncratic. Apart from our Hunter Ranger Machine Gunner of Death, we have: * A grown wild child Wolf Totem Barbarian who doesn't really do the whole ""material things"" thing. She fought unarmored for a while, then was given decent armor once and promptly lost it after the party was captured. Now she's to just fighting in leather, since that's what's comfortable for her. She only has 13 Dex and 15 Con so her Unarmored Defense isn't great. She's also very attached to a mundane greataxe she won years ago during her brief time trying to live with humans, and only knows how to fight with that or javelins in a pinch. * A Moon Druid who doesn't use shields, spends most of his spells on healing during combat, and doesn't really use weapons. He's also terrified of fire after being tortured and nearly slow-roasted alive, so Flame Blade and any other fire-related magics are out. His favorite spell is Call Lightning, which he's literally never been able to use because since he hit level 5 all the combat has been in rooms/caves/temples with ceilings less than 100' high (and will continue to be). * A Swashbuckler Rogue who never uses anything in his offhand, refuses to make ranged attacks (he threw a dagger once under great duress), and only uses a rapier and leather/studded leather armor. Additionally, they're completely built bottom-up. Meaning they're not min-maxed at all; they're statistical representations of character ideas the players had. So our Rogue has more Int than Con, for example, and our Barbarian has more Wis than Dex. The other constraints we're working with are 1) Magical items with strict statistical bonuses (XYZ +1) aren't that interesting to us and 2) items tied into the campaign/story/characters are much more interesting than the random junk lying around. Also, they're not terribly interested in the sidequests that have little to do with the main plot, so we'll be missing a few items because of that. So with my homebrew, I'm trying to come up with things that are part of the story and that also compensate for the party's idiosyncrasies in ways that are interesting and fun, while also helping them tackle the endgame gauntlet. (Because of plot reasons, the likely order of encounters is Vanifer alone, maybe talk Gar down or maybe kill him then possibly have to kill Olhydra, then Aerisi + Yan-C-Bin with Gar possibly helping the party.) There are also a few items from the DMG that I'm considering throwing in. Here's what I'm thinking for items to sprinkle in. I'm very new to this, so I'd love any feedback on things like how the items feel, the balance implications, or anything else! *** ##Items for our Barbarian The barbarian is the main tank, so she definitely needs some good armor that's in-character for her. A weapon upgrade would also be good since she's missing out on the super-powerful *dwarven thrower* in the campaign book. **Upgrade her axe:** It used to have some elemental air power in it, but it was drained by the air cult to help summoning Yan-C-Bin. It will be recharged by an ally on finishing the Air Temple: * Blast of wind on attack roll 19-20 deals +1d8 force damage and randomly prones, disarms, or stuns target with a DC 16 Str save to avoid the status. (She usually uses Reckless Attack, so she has a 19% chance per attack to proc it.) * +1 hit. I considered ignoring the target's AC contribution from Dex, but that seems a little convoluted even if the accounting is all on my side of the screen. **Windsoul Javelin:** Considered Lightning Javelin, but having it be wind-themed makes more sense due to the character who forged it even though lightning is associated with wind. Also means no wondering how many javelins she has at any given time. * Returns when thrown. It doesn't actually have a head. Instead its magic generates a small, sharp zone of highly concentrated air when it is thrown, so it doesn't get stuck and can fly back to the wielder's hand. * Once per short/long rest, deals an extra 2d12 force damage to its target and the target must make a DC16 Str check or be knocked back 10' and proned. * Appears as a simple walking stick about 6' long. **Embrace of Kin:** Magic hide armor delivered by one of her wolf pack from Kryptgarden Forest. Local barbarians have been pushed out of the Dessarin Valley by the roving cultists and monsters, and some came into conflict with her pack. Their leader, another Wolf Totem Barbarian, wore this. * Hide Armor +1 (13 AC). * Can use Barbarian's Unarmored Defense while wearing it, giving her a total of 16 AC (1 less than half plate +2 from dexterity). ##Items for our Rogue Our rogue is hampered somewhat by his light armor, and moreso by his lack of an offhand weapon. That means he doesn't get his once-per-round sneak attack damage if he misses (unless he gets an opportunity attack). **Upgrade his Rapier:** He actually picked up a Rapier in Lost Mines that could deal 1d8 acid damage once per long rest, but he lost it when the party was captured. He'll be able to reclaim it during a sidequest, with some upgrades made by the air cult. This will let him deal more damage that standard dual-wielding, but I'm OK with that at the level we're at. After fighting with a handicap for so long, he deserves it. ;) And the action economy comes out the same since it's a bonus-action attack rider on the attack action. * The 1d8 acid damage ability changed to once per short or long rest instead of per long rest * Can make 1 attack as a bonus action per turn when making the attack action * +2 Initiative **Glamoured Studded Leather:** (from DMG), worn by the air-cult Bard Windharrow who escaped from the party after they defeated him (dimension door for the win!). In their first confrontation, our Rogue singled him out, charged him, critically missed, and fell on his face, at which I gave Windharrow a reaction to cast Vicious Mockery on him. There's bad blood between the two, to say the least. * Studded Leather +1 (AC 13, no Dex cap to AC) * Can command the armor to look like other armor or like normal clothes. Lasts indefinitely. ##Items for our Druid Here, I'm trying to offset the lack of a shield and his tendency to over-rely on healing magic in combat since he can't cast his favored spell. Also trying to add some resilience to make up for the 2-3 AC lost by not using a shield. **Pearl of Power:** In the campaign book. Found in the Black Geode. * Once per day, can restore one spell slot up to 3rd level. The Ranger could also use this, but I don't think he'll want it that badly. **Staff of Ilmater:** Given to him by a healer who served Ilmater while she nursed him back to health post-fire-torture. Long backstory behind it, but the staff noticed all the shit the druid had gone through and is doing what it can to make him suffer less. (Seriously, his pre-adventuring life sucked, and everything that's happened to him in the campaign has sucked even more.) She gave it to him before he left. He uses it in his off-hand (he usually has his mistletoe focus in his main hand). * +1 AC. * Semi-aware weapon. Will not strike a living creature in combat. Against undead, functions as a +1 Quarterstaff with 2d6+1 damage. This campaign doesn't have many undead, so it's just a nice flavor thing. Came in handy against the ghouls in the water temple, though. * Once per day, the wielder can absorb a blow dealt to a seen creature within 200'. The wielder has effective resistance to the damage. This functions while in wild shape, helping shore up the Moon Druid weakness of having huge gobs of effective HP but not being able to do much to draw aggro or protect others. * The wielder has resistance against poison damage and advantage on saves vs. poison and disease. This functions even while the wielder is in wild shape. * If the wielder commits a selfless act - either absorbing a blow or something else - it also grants the ability to cast *mass healing word* as a bonus action) and *prayer of healing* (as a ritual) at their lowest levels, once per day. **Circlet of Channeling:** Left behind by the same friend who created the Windsoul Javelin. Pretty self-explanatory. Lets him cast his favored spell where otherwise it would always be shut off. * Allows the wearer to cast *call lightning* with the cloud appearing at the height of the ceiling if it's less than 100' high. * When the wearer is struck in melee combat, the attacker takes 1d4 lightning damage. **Gift of the Great Oak:** Belongs to a particular cultist who duped our Druid's adoptive father into helping design the Rite of the Wicker Giant. Incidentally the chaotic elemental magics involved drove said adoptive father insane, and our Druid had to kill him in self-defense. (Remember when I said his life sucks?) Said cultist isn't using this because of his alignment shift. * Non-evil only, Druid-only * Hide armor (AC 12), no Dexterity restriction to AC * Permanent Pass Without Trace in woods (just for flavor here; unlikely to travel in woods) * Wielder cannot be crit (works while in wild shape; other abilities do not) * Gives cold resistance and fire vulnerability (for thematic reasons, and because why not twist the knife in our fire-tormented Druid?) ##Items for our Murder-Ranger This guy's solid. Doesn't really *need* anything to shore him up, so I don't feel like I need to design anything for him specifically. Of course he's welcome to all of the usual items lying around (wands, potions, *Lost Crown of Bessilmer*, etc., and he's the best candidate for the *elven chain*). **Quiver of Lightning:** The final item left behind by our departed ally. * Once per short/long rest, can fire an arrow that explodes for 2d6 lightning damage, hit or miss. All ammunition drawn from it counts as magical, and can deal lightning damage instead of piercing damage. Helps deal with the party's weakness to hordes. ##Items for Whoever Strewn about the dungeons, no real tie-ins to the plot: * Quyaals Feather Token * Stone of Good Luck * Dust of Disappearance * Elven Chain * Periapt of Wound Closure * Mariners Armor * Alchemy Jug * Trident of Fish Command * Belt of Dwarvenkind * Brazier of Fire Elemental Control * Wand of Web * Bag of Holding * Lost Crown of Bessilmer: Resistance to psychic damage, advantage vs. charm, bonus action to basically 1d6 Bardic Inspiration someone (3 charges, recharges 1d3 per day) And a few others that the party can choose from after completing a major sidequest: * Portable Hole * Cloak of Elvenkind * Gloves of Missile Snaring * Helm of Telepathy * Ring of Evasion * Boots of Levitation * Driftglobe * Helm of Teleportation * Ring of Mind Shielding * Mantle of Spell Resistance *** I think that's everything! Let me know how this looks, and thanks for reading :D"
303,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] [Spoiler] Utilizing the **** of ***** in Curse of Strahd.,0,6zqtfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6zqtfo/5e_spoiler_utilizing_the_of_in_curse_of_strahd/,2017-09-13 09:31:24,"Hey there! I wanted to get some feedback on an idea I had for the Tome of Strahd relic from the Curse of Strahd campaign setting. My party had acquired the tome several sessions ago and were left with an underwhelming feeling. To my understanding, the tome divulges information about Strahd's history and talks about the sun sword, the latter of which being more valuable though the Tarokka reading already reveals that such a weapon exists. To satisfy my players, I wanted to come up with a use for the tome--and the following is what I came up with. First, I have been utilizing the Strahd as Dictator theme. The players are always unsure of who is and isn't a Strahd sympathizer or whether or not the NPC they are engaging with is ultimately in league with him. The people of Barovia are terrified of him and rarely, if ever, act against Strahd's oppressive measures for fear that they themselves, or their family, will be put in danger. Barovians also believe that Strahd is all-powerful and therefore un-defeatable. This is where the tome becomes a meaningful component to defeating him, but it requires a small, and subsequently inconsequential, piece of equipment found at The Wizard of Wines. That piece of equipment was a printing press used to put labels on wine bottles. Admittedly, what you're about to read is inspired in part by the protestant reformation and the idea that knowledge/information is power and the role that the printing press played in shaping European history. The Tome of Strahd is an item which is very intimate to the antagonist and demonstrates his capacity for vulnerability. If the Tome of Strahd could be reprinted for mass distribution by utilizing the printing press at the Wizard of Wines, pamphlets and propaganda materials which demonstrate Strahd's vulnerability could help to diminish his power over the Barovians, much of which is fuelled by their fear of him. Mortalizing him through the distribution and spread of what can otherwise be considered his diary could deal a massive blow against his unquestionable rule over the domain of Barovia. That, and it could potentially lead to a peasant like uprising on behalf of Barovia which may play instrumental in the player's quest to take/siege Castle Ravenloft. Thoughts? Am I missing something? Is there something I can tweak to convey this idea with greater opacity? Other parallels besides the reformation that I could draw on? Thanks in advance! TL;DR - Use the printing press at The Wizard of Wines to copy and distribute the Tome of Strahd to the people of Barovia and show that Strahd is vulnerable and not a god aka Anti-Strahd Propaganda."
304,vulnerability,DnD,A character death question,1,6quga8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6quga8/a_character_death_question/,2017-08-01 16:28:32,"If you're Shayne, Captain Vohan or Khadgar please turn away now So in our last session of a criminal campaign I played my drow Rouge Gerrick that I put a lot of work into died. We were attacked by three Yuan-Ti ships and in an epic solo stealth mission he assinated one of the three ships captains. Afterwards they burned the ship with fire canons so we couldn't have it or its spoils. Gerrick dove off the boat and swam to another. I wrapped a dagger in cloth ignited it and threw it at the fuel for the canons destroying the ship, my plan was to dive after throwing the dagger but i rolled a one on the save and thanks to a fire vulnerability he was left making death saves in the water. True to the posts title he died saving our boat, which belongs to Captain Vohan, another player. Now this character I've been role playing and loving was left dead on a beach and the other players just kind of took his items and through some player to player convincing they took his body and paid for a reincarnation (with party funds and some of his personal money). It worked and 6000 gold later he returned as an Eladrian. I'm not sure if I'm fond of the change and have a back up character made (I always have one just in case, this one is Gerricks half brother Ozlow who is a shadow monk charlatan) Anyways I'm wondering if anyone has an opinion on what to do or has been in a similar situation, I'm sure we could retcon the revival and I could play Ozlow EDIT: sorry for any mispellings or bad grammer "

306,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrew runecrafting and lost of potential runes: would love feedback (long post),0,6tb8cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6tb8cd/homebrew_runecrafting_and_lost_of_potential_runes/,2017-08-13 07:52:35,"Runes can be inscribed onto weapons and armor using ancient dwarven script, lyrium (inspired by Dragon Age, although I'd like a different name for the material), and skill. There is no spellcasting involved, although lyrium does have magic inside of it. Lyrium has three levels of potency, each corresponding to the level of rune you make inscribe. When making runes, you must succeed in a number of arcana checks (1+ rarity of rune). The DC is based on the power of the rune(DC 13 for minor, 15 for major, 17 for legendary). If you fail the check twice, roll once on the table below. The runemaking process takes 8 full hours. TABLE (roll 1d4s for minor runes, 1d6s for major runes, and 1d10s legendary runes) 1- you fall asleep (8 hours for minor, 2 days for major, one week for legendary) 2- you get hit by the ""Thunderwave"" spell with no saving throw and only you get effected 3- the rune backfires and affects you, though you still failed on inscribing the rune 4- the lyrium loses one degree of potency (minor to broken, major to minor, legendary to major) 5-you teleport to the nearest empty prison cell 6-the lyrium explodes, dealing true damage to all within 15ft (4d8 for major, 6d10 for legendary) 7- 1d3 Inevitables (of your dms choice) appears within 5ft of you 8- roll on this table two more times 9- for the next 24 hours, anyone who knows your full name knows exactly where you are 10- the lyrium is destroyed, leaving no trace of it, you are transported to a random dimension of your dm's choice, and there's a 50/50 chance of magic items not coming with you (coin flip for each magic item) List of Runes and Their Effects: Runes add damage and/or effects. Many runes require someone to make saving throws. The dc for these saving throws are based on the runecrafter, not the user, and so use the crafter's proficiency and their int for the formula (DC 8+proficiency+int) Unless stated otherwise, you may activate these runes only twice per long rest and any rune that effects other creatures must hit before the rune takes effect. Minor Runes: PUFF- gives blindness on failed dex save for 1 round FLAMES- deal 1d4 extra fire damage. Regain this every short rest CHILL- on failed con save, -10ft of movement. Does not stack. Regain this every short rest Ringing- cause deafness on failed con save INSTABILITY- cause the ground in a 10ft wide sphere centered on where hit (doesn't have to target creature) to become difficult terrain. The ground doesn't look any different than it did before. DEFENSE- may use your bonus action to gain +1 AC until the beginning of your next turn SWIFTNESS- you gain +10ft of movement for one round COWARDICE- you may disengage from one target as a bonus action Major Runes: LIGHTNING- deal Xd4 damage to all within 5ft of target where X= the number of creatures within 5ft HAMMERHEAD- knock target prone on failed str save and deal an extra 1d6 bludgeoning damage (no save) PLAGUE- cause the target to be poisoned on failed con save and take 1d6 extra poison damage (no save) SHOCK- cause target to be stunned on failed con save and have vulnerability to lightning (1 round) FORCE- knock back 20ft on failed strength save and take 1d6 force damage PROTECTION- succeed on any str, con, or dex saving throw RESISTANCE- gain resistance to a type of damage of your choice as a reaction until the beginning of your next turn DUELING- when hit by a melee attack, you make use your reaction to attack the attacker with a melee attack of your own (can cast touch cantrips as well). If you were hit by a ranged attack, you may respond with a ranged attack of your own (or a ranged cantrip). Legendary Runes: STONE- cause petrification on failed wisdom save and an extra die of bludgeoning damage INFERNO- cause target to immolate, dealing 4d8 fire damage to all within 10ft and burning all flammable items that aren't being carried or worn. No saving throw. Weariness- cause 1 level of exhaustion on failed wisdom save BETRAYAL- charm target on failed charisma save. He fight on your side for one round but will not hurt himself BLINK- on failed intelligence save, target is transported to the ethereal plane for one round/to a planned point within 30ft. Alternatively, you could transport yourself to the point instead (cannot go to the ethereal however). To plan a point you must spend one bonus action to draw a quick rune on a surface. IMPUNITY- you are immune to non magical damage at all times and resistant to one type of damage of your choice until you switch the damage type as a bonus action. You may switch as many times as you like. "
307,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Homebrew Balancing Help,2,6ihx34,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6ihx34/5e_homebrew_balancing_help/,2017-06-21 09:31:38,"Hello all! Kind of first time DM here and was hoping for some help balancing a homebrew I've created. The basic of my homebrew is that it revolves around pantheons and deities. Each player chooses a pantheon to follow and they've become champions of this pantheon. Once the reach level 5, the get some awesome abilities. From there on out they have opportunities to gain experience for these abilities by raising their **God Levels**. What I'm looking for is not balance for 5e per say, but balance around the abilities of each deity. Each deity follows a concept, the greater deity's ability should have a stronger ability overall but it has its risked as well. This will be the pantheon of knowledge. #**Forha, God of Knowledge.** Forhas overwhelming knowledge is bestowed upon you. You gain the status Infused for fifteen minutes. **Infused**  Your body glows as runic lines coarse through you veins. You gain advantage on all rolls. Once Infused has run out gain a point of exhaustion. At **God Level Seven** infused upgrades. Forha's knowledge encompasses you. It feels like you can predict the future. All enemies have disadvantage on any attack on you. As soon as infused runs out youre blinded for fifteen minutes. *I know this is basically Foresight with negatives so far but if the player pursues this path, this is the reward since they most likely won't have any level nine spells at this time.* At **God Level Thirteen** upgrades once more. Forhas knowledge weaves into you. On an attack of fifteen or higher (no modifiers) you critically hit. Once infused runs out roll a d20. On a one gain four points of exhaustion, on a two through ten gain three points of exhaustion, one eleven through nineteen gain two points of exhaustion, on a twenty gain one point of exhaustion. At **God Level Seventeen** infused upgrades for a final time. Forhas knowledge is one with you. Once per turn your first hit is a guaranteed critical, on all other attacks add a +5 modifier. Once infused has run its course you fall unconscious for an hour. Roll for exhaustion, as stated at God Level Thirteen. So that's the greater deity now I have four lesser deities that all have various uses. #**Shel-Dir - God of Tactics** Shel-Dir gifts you the knowledge of armor. Permanently see enemy AC. On a successful strike reduce enemy AC by one, maxes out at three. At **God Level Seven** Shel-Dir grants you the knowledge of weapons. Permanently see enemy's physical attacks. When an attack misses you, you reduce enemy to hit modifier by one, maxes at three . At **God Level Thirteen** Shel-Dir brings you the knowledge of attack. When you successfully hit an enemy gain +1 to hit, maxes out at three. At **God Level Seventeen** Shel-Dir brings you the knowledge of defense. When you successfully dodge an attack, gain +1 to your AC, maxes at three. *Not a very exciting one but the idea behind this one was passive abilities that weaken them and strengthen yourself.* #**Kuroka  Goddess of Time** Gain the ability to use a second bonus action. At **God Level Seven** gain the ability to use Halt. **Halt**: As a reaction stop an enemies action. They make a Constitution saving throw of sixteen. If they fail, they stop their current action and lose the rest of their turn. If they succeed they continue with their action. At **God Level Thirteen** gain the Slow Aura. **Slow Aura**: All enemies in an encounter against you gain a +3(or -3) to initiative rolls. We use the alternative combat rules where you roll each turn. If we returned to the original initiative system I think I would change this ability. At **God Level Seventeen** gain Time Change. **Time Change**: In a 10x10 area box, time grinds to a halt. All units within the box cannot do any actions. This spell ends if one action is used against them during this period, or any effects that you create during this period affect the area. #**Puck  God of Space** Gain the ability to use Displace. **Displace**: Choose an enemy you can see and move them up to 40 ft. They must make a Dexterity saving throw of eighteen. If they succeed they resistant and do not move. If they fail, choose a location for them to move them to. At **God Level Seven** gain the ability to Phase Shift. **Phase Shift**: Once per combat encounter, use a reaction dodge an attack by phasing to a different dimension for a few seconds. Once youve returned, get a free counter attack if the attack against you was melee. At **God Level Thirteen** gain the ability to Switch. **Switch**: Once per combat encounter switch your position with any object living or nonliving, you can see. If you switch with something that is the same size as you the switch goes off without a problem. Every size larger or smaller than you, make an Intelligence saving throw of ten + five (per size difference). On a successful switch places. On a failure, nothing happens. At **God Level Seventeen** gain the ability to Tear. **Tear**: Make a distortion in space where an enemy is. The enemy is torn asunder taking 25d8 force damage. The must make a Strengthsaving throw of twenty. On a success, they resist taking no damage. On a failure, they take full damage. Kuroka and Puck are the two which I feel the least confident about in terms of combat since they are more utility. The thing I'm most unsure about is how often these ability should be used. Since Forha is all about gain for a short period of time and penalties afterwords I feel it balances out a bit more. Next one could destroy a character or make them the greatest hero ever. The next deity is the odd one out of the group. #**Newx  God of Chaos** Gain the ability to Tempt Fate. Once every two weeks roll a d20. Whatever number you roll has an effect associated with it that will last two weeks. 1. All stats decrease by 2. 2. All stats decrease by 1. 3. Decrease max HP by 1d10. 4. Gain two random vulnerabilities. 5. Decreases max HP by 1d8. 6. Decreases max HP by 1d6. 7. Decrease max HP by 1d4. 8. Gain one random vulnerability. 9. Lose one random stat point. 10. Gain -1 to hit modifier. 11. Gain +1 to hit modifier. 12. Gain one random stat point. 13. Gain one random resistance. 14. Increase max HP by 1d4. 15. Increase max HP by 1d6. 16. Increase max HP by 1d8. 17. Gain two random resistances. 18. Increase max HP by 1d10 19. All stats increase by 1. 20. All stats increase by 2. At **God Level Seven** gain the ability to reroll the dice in Tempt Fate. Keep the second number. At **God Level Thirteen** gain the ability to add another dice roll in Tempt Fate. If the abilities cancel each other out, nothing happens. At **God Level Seventeen** gain the ability to add the numbers together. Take all results from the dice. (Will let them see the choices and they can decide to take them or not.) 2. Death. 3. Permanently lose 1 in all stats. 4. Lose 15 max HP permanently. 5. Lose 15 max HP permanently. 6. Lose one random stat permanently. 7. Lose 10 max HP permanently. 8. Gain one permanent vulnerability. 9. Lose 5 max HP permanently. 10. Decrease max HP by 1d20. 11. Lose two random stats, they can be the same. 12. Gain two random vulnerability. 13. Lose two random stats, they cannot be the same. 14. Gain -3 to hit modifier. 15. Lose one random stat. 16. Gain -2 to hit modifier. 17. Gain one random vulnerability. 18. Decrease max HP by 1d10. 19. Gain -1 to hit modifier. 20. Decrease max HP by 1d6 21. Nothing happens. 22. Nothing happens. 23. Increase max HP by 1d6 24. Gain +1 to hit modifier. 25. Increase max HP by 1d10. 26. Gain one random resistance. 27. Gain +2 to hit modifier. 28. Gain one random stat. 29. Gain +3 to hit modifier. 30. Gain two random stats, they cannot be the same. 31. Gain two random resistance. 32. Gain two random stats, they can be the same. 33. Decrease max HP by 1d20. 34. Gain 5 max HP permanently. 35. Gain one permanent resistance. 36. Gain 10 max HP permanently. 37. Gain one random stat permanently. 38. Gain 15 max HP permanently. 39. Permanently gain 1 in all stats. 40. When you fall in combat, stand back up perfectly healthy once. So that's that. I would like your opinions of overall balance. Also if you think anything is much to strong in the overall context of 5e I would like to know. God Levels progress around the same speed of actual levels so it'll take them a while to reach God Level seventeen but if they role play well enough and convince enough people to follow them it might speed it up a bit. Haven't fully finalized how god levels will rise but have a basic idea. This is all for one player so they will be presented with these options as soon as they reach five. Thanks all for any help!

308,vulnerability,DnD,Rolling for Stats: 4d6-drop-the-lowest vs d20,2,6jjba6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6jjba6/rolling_for_stats_4d6dropthelowest_vs_d20/,2017-06-26 15:52:42,"My friend and I have been DMing a few games with a few different groups and we've been having a discussion with regards to character creation that has really come to a boiling point in the last few weeks. We've been allowing people to either roll 4d6-drop-lowest or d20 for their stats. We took Matt Coleville's suggestion and have their first roll be for strength, second for dex, and so on. Once they do all 6 stats, we try to make sure players have 2 stats at 15 or above. If they do from the initial rolls, they're all done! If they don't have 2 at 15+ then we go through the sub-15 stats and re-roll, only replacing the stat if the roll is 15+, so those first 6 are likely to stick. What I've found is that the negative repercussions of rolling d20s (getting a 1, 2, or 3 at a radically higher frequency) does not outweigh the positives of getting an 18, 19, or 20 at radically higher rates. From all the characters that have come out of d20s, there's only been 2 that have drastically suffered (both because of very low Dex AND Con stats). Most characters are very strong even with 1 or 2 low stats (as long as it's not the Dex AND Con combination) if not wildly overpowered (18, 19, 19, 10, 20, 17). My friend contends that there are drawbacks to having a super low stat no matter what it is, but I think they're all perfectly capable of being worked around and very circumstantial, almost always worth taking that risk in the hopes that you just don't encounter your Achilles heel; can't carry anything with low strength, fall to traps and the common dexterity save effects, low health and concentration with low constitution, perhaps poor logical skills with low intelligence, vulnerability to a number of spell effects with low wisdom or low charisma. I'm convinced the negatives can all be worked around with a specific play style, and maybe that's the fun in rolling d20s. My question is: is it overpowered? Any ideas or feedback is appreciated. Perhaps there's something more to it that I'm missing. Thanks so much! EDIT: I'm pretty sure this is now closed because of time constraints, but thank you for all the responses! My 6 dexterity, 7 intelligence Eldritch Knight grappler died tonight and he was definitely the most fun character I've ever played (Fezzik from The Princess Bride turned Andre the Giant). A lot of people said they wouldn't play in my game and that's fine! We like having our friends try out new character ropes and puzzling together a fun character with random stats, and our players have enjoyed the character creation puzzle, so all is well there. I also played a group where we all did 4d6d1 and created a group array for which we assigned to whatever stats we chose. Unfortunately we get new characters in games all the time, so difference works fine. I tend to agree that 6 is the lowest reasonable stat (I just rolled a 5 charisma for my next character on 4d6d1, and my buddy rolled a 2 dexterity on d20 lol), and that anything lower SHOULD have serious ramifications for play. I agree that these flaws are insanely fun to roleplay. Some of them are a little dicey, like the 1 int possibility... I think in the future we might try different styles, or give more player choice, but I think I'll push to have the d20 option eliminated or more harsh things done about it."
309,vulnerability,DnD,Yawning Portal - Forge of Fury: how to run the later part?,1,6kfd88,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6kfd88/yawning_portal_forge_of_fury_how_to_run_the_later/,2017-06-30 21:37:02,"Sorry for the long rant. I'm currently running my players through the Yawning Portal dungeons. The party is level 4: * Tempest Cleric * Paladin, Oath of the Ancients * Warlock, pact of the Great Old One * Rogue, Arcane Trickster Up until recently they also had Meepo with them, who I was running as a level 1 beastmaster ranger (he wanted to ride a dragon someday). They are in the Forge of Fury, and I'm starting to wonder if the adventure is even designed for the players to do the entire thing, or if the adventure is telling them subtly to puss out and forget about a few of the maps because they are LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE. I've read up on the 3E version of the adventure as well and it was lethal then too. A lot of DMs made tweaks to certain encounters near the end of the adventure or handed out extra loot so the party could stand a chance. So here's what happened. **If you're a player doing this thing, obviously spoilers ahead.** They do well on the first and second level of the dungeon, but they fail to get through the door to the Forge, so they search far and wide for the key, don't find it (it's not on that level) and decide to go down the stairs they found. Then things go sideways fast. They grey ooze eats the +1 bonus off the Paladin's magic sword, to start with. Then they meet Mr Roper. Background on the 3E version of the roper: *it had a vulnerability to fire, if you cut off a tentacle it didn't grow back (but that changed in 3.5)*, **it had a pretty high int and could speak terran or undercommon**, *it had a pretty ridiculous spell resistance, and to make things worse if it grabbed you you lost 10 STR permanently.* The current 5E roper is ""toned down"". It's dumb as bricks, has no language, and doesn't do the strength drain (it just gives you disadvantage on STR checks and saves while grappled). But the tentacles grow back instantly. It has 6 total, and can attempt to use up to 4 of them to grapple somebody at a range of 50ft. It can drag all its tentacles 25 ft towards it, and it can make 1 bite attack for 4d8+4 damage (potentially insta-killing anyone but the paladin). That's **one** of its turns. It can also hold somebody under the water while it is dealing with their friends. The roper is slow as shit with only 10ft of movement, so the obvious tactic is to stand outside its tentacle range and fling spells, arrows and alchemists fire (which is abundant in the dungeon, but the 5E roper doesn't have fire vulnerability and alchemist's fire doesn't do as much damage as it used to). **But there is no place where you can get outside of the tentacle range and still see the creature.** The other obvious tactic is to cut off the tentacles, but they regenerate the next turn! In the previous version of the adventure, the roper could speak. The PCs were encouraged to bargain with it and provide it with a better meal. You can still see the remnants of this in the descriptive text for the GM in the TftYP version. So the roper instakills and eats Meepo in turn 2 - OK so he spends 2 turns dying in its stomach before crit-failing his death save and dying permanently. This thing has a 20AC so only 1 person has hit it yet. It's got the entire party in its tentacles and only needed one turn to drag them all into bite range. It's holding 2 of them under the water. At some point the Warlock escapes the grapple, but he's in the river and fails his save so he gets dragged off by the current and only manages to drag himself to shore 2 turns later and he's in the Troglodyte area of the cavern. Any more and he would have fallen on top of the dragon or something. It was a shit show, nothing they did hit, all their big damage spells and effects missed, they barely made it out alive *because I started making the roper intentionally use its bite attack on whoever had the most HP at the time*. It would have TPK'ed them otherwise and I'm a wuss. So long story short. If I had known about the lethality of that fight, I would have either toned down the difficulty, or ideally, I would have just given it a language to speak so the party could have known about the ""bargain with it"" option. There are many hilarious stories from the 3E version where the roper just took somebody hostage while the rest of them tried to find it a worthy meal. But that's all in hindsight. There are still 2 more potentially lethal encounters in this dungeon, namely the succubus and the dragon (if they don't get killed by a fucking table or a rug...). The succubus will be a surprise to them, and if her plan works and she gets one or two partymembers alone she could insta-KO the Rogue, the Warlock or the Cleric and charm whoever isn't a half-elf. With two divine characters in the party, though, I really don't think they'll fall for her shit. It'll be a challenging fight but the reward is substantial so I'm okay with it. She can't restrain characters like the roper can, and she can't leave the room, so they have an out. I don't think this encounter needs a tweak **but I'd love to hear from people who have already run this to know if I'm correct.** The dragon is going to be next to impossible. It's a dragon, so okay. But they know about the dragon, they have time to prepare for it... They just have very little to prepare with. They only have access to 2nd level divine spells (so no protection from energy). The dungeon has given them potions of water breathing, which will come in handy. But no acid resistance. And of course the dragon is in its natural terrain and is just gonna swim under the water and occasionally poke its head out to deliver a nice refreshing 11d8 of acid damage (insta-KOing anybody who doesn't make their save, and the rogue and the cleric even if they DO make their save). There is not enough XP in the dungeon for them to level up to 5 without defeating the dragon - unless they decide to massacre the Duergar they just negotiated with, maybe. **How do I make this a little less... Dark Souls?** Maybe the dragon can't use its breath attack under water? The water dilutes the acid and it does nothing or it does less damage. The players would go in the water to fight it, reducing it to claw and bite attacks, forcing the dragon to leave the water to regain the advantage, effectively reversing the dynamic of the fight. Maybe I can tweak the loot a little, throw a scroll of elemental resistance in the library, a potion of acid resistance in the forge, a +1 weapon for the 2 people who don't have one yet, and so on. Or I could run the dragon like it's a dumbass, pretend it didn't recharge its breath weapon when it did, and otherwise cheat. **tl;dr: Some encounters in Forge of Fury feel WAY WAY WAY TOO TOUGH for fourth or fifth level characters! Not 'tough but fair' but 'lol if you try this fight you die'. Has anyone run this? What would you suggest?** "

None of us have played before so im making a small oneshot to test the waters. What i need help with is the final encounter in a dungeon. The encounter starts as the characters walk into a room in the dungeon and three skeletons emerge from coffins. Two of them have shortswords, but the other one (the leader) has a longsword and shield, he also has a constrictor snake living in his rib cage that will attack as the skeleton is attacking. The party will be three level one characters. The problem is im not sure if this is too easy, considering skeleton's vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and i also dont know what weapons the players will be wielding, let alone their classes. Any advice for a novice dm?"

Be critical! :D I have created a magic item for my next campaign. This would be for the entire party, not just one person. The item would consist of 6 dice in game. a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and a d20. The purpose of the item is a few things, it's to have cool random buffs happen (like a VERY low impact Deck of Many Things) because that's fun. Also there is the mini game of picking which die to roll (explained in a min). So I'd love for some feedback on the item. Based on the number you roll, that is the result you get. So if you roll a d8 and get a 6, it's the same result as if you rolled a d6 and got a 6. The higher numbers start to get higher risk for higher reward (for example the d4 is all good things! But it's all minor good things). Some things are intended to have both positive AND negative effects (usually with the positives being more major than others because they come at a cost) Also, there are Minor, Moderate, and Major good or bad outcomes by design. So I will post the item, and describe the intent of each outcome and you guys tell me what is utter garbage or way overpowered or would cause you not to use it etc. * 1 - (Minor +) Advantage on the next skill check within the next hour * 2 - (Minor +) Apply your prof bonus to 1 skill you are not proficient in for the next hour * 3 - (Minor +) Gain your level in temp HP * 4 - (Minor +) Your speed increases by 10ft for the next hour * 5 - (Minor -) For the next hour you must shout when you speak * 6 - (Moderate +) Gain double your level in temp HP * 7 - (Moderate -) You must return to this spot in one week or be sickened for the duration of the 8th day * 8 - (Moderate +) Gain invisibility for the next 3d6 minutes until you attack or cast a spell * 9 - (Moderate -) DC 13 Con save or 1 level of Exhaustion * 10 - (Moderate +) Party can communicate telepathically with each other for the next hour * 11 - (Moderate -/+) Party gains a resistance of their choice and a vulnerability of the DM's choice for the rest of the day * 12 - (Moderate +) You may teleport up to 100ft (use it or lose it) * 13 - (Moderate -/+) For the next round of combat, you have advantage on all attacks, but all attacks against you have advantage as well * 14 - (Moderate +) A random trinket appears (from a list of mostly flavor magic items that I have) * 15 - (Moderate -) DC 11 Con save or start coming down with Sewer Plague disease * 16 - (Moderate -/Major +) You know the location of the highest CR enemy within 1 mile, but it also knows your location * 17 - (Moderate -) You have disadvantage on your next saving throw within the next hour * 18 - (Major +) ??? * 19 - (Major -/+) You have advantage on Dex saves and disadvantage on Wis/Con saves for the next hour * 20 - (MAJOR +) Your HP goes to full, your spent spell slots are refreshed, and you get advantage on attack rolls for the next 2d6 minutes So I KNOW 20 is busted. That's sort of the point. They can use each respective die once per day, so they only have a 5% chance of getting it any given day. I'm ok with that.

And I had some requests to post the Custom Wild Magic table I made for the campaign. Well here it is! I know about 35-40 of these are straight out of the table in the PHB (it's hard to make up 100 random magical effects). I kept some that they liked from the book and looked up some fun ones online and had them submit ideas. I know I'll read some comments that tell me these are super OP and unbalanced and can ruin the game\world, but the players requested this and enjoy it, so if you don't like it, then don't use it in your world. Or just edit what you do like. Sorry about how long it is\formatting, it probably sucks. I copied these from the tables I made in OneNote. Table: 1 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result. 2 You are possessed! A Demon inhabits your body and tries to influence you by whispering in your mind how great it would be to commit acts of evil. 3 You grow a 2nd head. This head has a different personality from you. Usually is in direct conflict with whatever you want or whatever decisions you make. The head will be RP'd by the DM and believe himself to be the true owner of your body. He will try to influence your decisions to find a way to remove your head and keep your body. The Extra Head can be removed with a Remove Curse Spell. 4 1 Random Creature within 50 ft of you is brought back to life at full HP. If none are dead, then nothing happens. 5 A Modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears within 5 ft of you for 1 min. 6 You cast Sleep as a 3rd Lvl spell centered on yourself. 7 You cast Fireball as a 3rd Lvl spell centered on yourself 8 For the next minute, your weapon becomes sentient with the soul of the last creature you killed. 9 Re-Roll twice for 2 simultaneous effects on this table, ignoring this result. 10 Until the next sunrise, the last creature you killed appears as a ghost and follows you around. Everyone can see and hear it, but it will only interact with you. It is unaffected by all attacks and spells and pesters you the entire time. Some will trash talk you, others will moan about being dead, some will just shriek the entire time. 11 Roll a d10. Your height changes by that many inches. Odd = Shrink | Even = Grow 12 Amnesia hits you and you can't remember who you are for 4d4 hours. 13 You cast confusion on yourself. 14 For the next minute, magical darkness fills the area within 10 ft of you. 15 For the next minute, you regain 5 HP at the start of your turn. 16 1d100 gold coins rain down in a 30 ft radius. Anyone caught in the radius takes 1d10 points of damage. Coins vanish after 1d10 minutes. 17 You believe you are a Raging Barbarian for 1d4 rounds. You dont know how to use magic and can only make melee attacks. 18 Earthquake! The earth rumbles around you. Everyone in a 50 ft radius of you must make a DC 15 Dex save or be knocked prone. 19 You cast grease centered on yourself. 20 You find yourself surrounded by 1d100 Rats. 21 A rain of fish starts with you at the center. 1d6 fish fall from the sky per 5 ft. Each does only 1 point of damage. Lasts for 1d6 rounds. 2 mile radius. The fish do not disappear after the rain ends. 22 For the next hour, a small cloud hangs over your head and rains on you. 23 Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. Only a Remove Curse Spell can end the effect. 24 An eye appears on your forehead and gives you advantage on Perception checks based on sight for 1 minute. 25 You grow extra limbs for 24 hours. Roll a 1d6. Stats do not change, the limbs mimic your regular limbs motions. 6 or 5 = Nothing 4 = 1 Arm 3 = 1 Leg 2 = 2 arms 1 = 2 arms and 1 leg. 26 The Nearest dead body to the caster becomes a Zombie and attacks the caster. 27 You set the nearest forest ablaze. 28 Each creature within 20 ft of you becomes confused for the next 1d6 rounds. Roll a d10 at the start of its turn to determine its behavior. 29 You teleport 60 ft to the closest unoccupied space in a random direction (1d8) 30 Caster summons an animal as if from the Rust Colored PokeBag. Roll a 1d6. Animal listens to your commands and uses its action on your turn. 31 You are transported to the Astral Plane until the start of your next turn, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. 32 1 Random creature within 50 ft of the caster becomes invulnerable for 1d4 rounds. 33 1 Random creature within 50 ft of the caster becomes empowered for 1d4 rounds. Will automatically score a crit on any hit for the duration. 34 1 Random creature within 20 ft of you becomes friendly towards you until the end of its next turn. 35 Roll a d20. Your age changes by that many years. Odd = Younger | Even = Older 36 Your ability to cast magic is affected. For 1d6 rounds, any time you cast a spell, the effects are replaced by another spell of the same level. The DM rolls to determine the spell. The spell does not have to be class specific. 37 1d6 Flumphs controlled by the DM appear within 60 ft of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. 38 You swap places with the target of your last spell. If no target, the closest creature to you. 39 You regain 1d10 HP. 40 Avalanche! The closest mountain to you has an avalanche occur. If you are on a mountain, you better start running! 41 You turn into a Potted Plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 HP, the pot breaks and your form reverts. 42 A torrent of knowledge floods your mind and you suddenly know the answer to the meaning of life. And it drives you mad! Roll on the Short Term Madness Table. Effect lasts for 1d6 rounds. Then you forget the meaning of life unfortunately, but it's always right there on the tip of your tongue. 43 For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 ft as a bonus action on each turn. 44 Your target's size increases one category for 1d4 rounds. 45 Your target's size decreases one category for 1d4 rounds. 46 You cast Levitate on yourself. 47 A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 ft of you for 1 minute. 48 You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, you vomit profusely. 49 Re-Roll on this table. 50 No effect at all. You feel calm and relieved that nothing weird happened when you used magic for once. 51 You cannot stand still for the next 10 minutes. (If in combat, you must move as least one space every time) 52 Your target is duplicated after the effect of the spell you just cast. If no target, no effect. 53 You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 3d6 days. 54 An unattended object within 20 ft of you suddenly bursts into flames. 55 Your hair falls out. But grows back in 24 hours. 56 One random creature within 20 ft of you is blinded for 1d6 rounds. 57 For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried bursts into flames. 58 All creatures within 10ft of you must succeed on a STR save, DC = 15 or be pushed 15ft away from you. 59 2d20 Trees grow out of the ground, all around you. 60 Target disarmed - The target is so taken aback by the spell you just cast, it drops anything it's holding. If no target, no effect. 61 For the next minute, any time you speak, it must be in rhyme. If it doesn't rhyme it comes out as unintelligible gibberish and no one can understand you. You cant give commands to any creatures this way or cast any spells. 62 You regain 1 sorcery point. 63 You cast Fog Cloud centered on yourself. 64 2d6 chickens appear at the casters feet and run away at top speed. 65 You cast Inflict Wounds on the creature nearest to you as a Lvl 1 spell. If none are in range, cast it on yourself. 66 You permanently grow a pair of small horns on your forehead. Remove Curse will remove them. 67 You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 68 All creatures within 10 ft of you become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. 69 1d6 Nymphs appear and try to charm you. 70 Each creature within 30 ft of you becomes invisible for 1 minute. Invisibility ends when it attacks or casts a spell 71 You evaporate any water within 2 miles of you. 72 You are overcome with the feeling of friendliness and think every situation can be resolved peacefully. For 1d4 rounds when you go to attack any creature, you feel like maybe just talking to them instead will lead to a peaceful resolution. 73 A random creature within 60 ft of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours. 74 You glow bright light for 30 ft. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 ft of you is blinded until the end of its next turn 75 Until the end of your next turn, you have tapped into the fires of creations. You eyes glows, your voice becomes deep and reverberating. You levitate 5 feet above the ground and are wreathed in radiant energy. All attacks against you automatically fail. You feel a taste of what it is to be a god. On your next turn, you can choose to attack, teleport or create. If you choose to attack, you only make one attack even if you normally are allowed more. By putting your all into this attack, you automatically critically hit your target with maximized damage (maximum die rolls). If you choose to teleport, you move yourself and up to nine others to anywhere in any existing plane, though if you choose an inhospitable plane, you may all immediately perish. If you choose to create, you think of a single non-artifact magical item and you can manifest it before yourself. Magical items created this way depend on your godly magic to sustain itself, after 1d6 days the magic wears off and it becomes a mundane item. 76 You cast Fly on yourself. 77 You cast polymorph on yourself. If you fail the save, roll to see what you become for the spell's duration. 78 Your next spell does Max Damage. 79 Body Odor. Your body chemistry is altered emitting a foul smell centered on you. For 1 hour, all creatures have advantage tracking you and know your exact location if they are within 50 ft. 80 You instantly know the answer to the next 1d10 questions that anyone asks you and the answers are all right. 81 You get instant Luck! You can use the Luck feat one time in the next 24 hours. 82 Target gets bad luck! He auto crit fails on his next attack. 83 Each creature within 30 ft of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain HP = to the amount of damage done. 84 You regain 2d12 HP. 85 A Call Lightning spell hits your target, in addition to the spell you just cast. 86 A Bolt Lightning flashes down and randomly strikes a creature within 20 ft of you, dealing 3d10 lightning damage. 87 You cast fly on a random creature within 60 ft of you. 88 You regain 1d4 sorcery points. 89 Your speed is doubled for 1d4 rounds. 90 You become invisible for 1 minute. During that time other creatures can't hear you. Invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell. 91 If you die within the next minute, you come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell. 92 Your target is paralyzed for # of rounds = to caster's level. 93 Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. 94 Your size decreases by one size category for the next minute. 95 You cast Blur on yourself. 96 You summon an elemental CR 1 of the type of the last spell you cast. The elemental is controlled by you and acts on your turn. 97 Caster can tell if anyone is lying for the next 1d4 days. 98 A minor God contacts you and offers his assistance with your task. 99 Time stops in a 100 ft radius centered on you for 1 round. Everyone is frozen but you. All creatures act as if paralyzed. 100 You regain all expended sorcery points. Edit: Formatting fix \ grammar "

You gain the construct subtype, but retain vulnerability to the Charmed condition and are vulnerable to Psychic Damage. Itty Bitty Living Space (SU): Your soul is trapped inside a Magic Jar. However, it can inhabit any totally enclosed set of full plate armor. -You gain no benefit from Second Wind. Instead, you benefit from a larger HP store and several immunities. Your STR, DEX, and CON scores cannot be increased except by magic or acquisition of a new set of armor. -The armor must be a complete set and in good repair. You cannot store items or carry creatures inside it. -If your current HP falls to 0, your spirit must abandon the armor and return to the Magic Jar. You can return to the Magic Jar at any time as an immediate action, but regaining control of a suit of armor requires 1 hour. If you fall to 1/4 your maximum HP, make a Charisma saving throw (DC 15) at the start of each of your turns to stay in your armor and keep fighting. -You no longer require rest, air, or sustenance, but you can no longer swim. You lose your senses of taste, touch, and smell, but you can still hear and see. You cannot become exhausted. -If your Magic Jar is destroyed, you will die immediately with no hope of resurrection as long as your real body is still occupied by the Wizard. -You cannot be more than 10 feet away from your Magic Jar at any time, or your spirit will leave the armor and return to the Jar. Dispel Magic (6th LV or higher) causes you to return to your Jar. -Healing spells do not work on your armor, it must be repaired as normal. -You are immune to blindness, critical hits, ability score damage, deafness, disease, poison, and other effects or attacks that affect your physiology or respiration because you have no physiology or respiration. -Your Hit Die increase by 12 each Levelup regardless of which armor you are inhabiting. Your HP at LV 1 is 10. -Your HP changes depending on the size of the object or armor you are inhabiting. Fine = 1/16, Diminutive = 1/8, Tiny = 1/4, Small =1/2, Medium = 1. -You weigh as much as your armor. Your base movement speed is 30 ft. I had to come up with the extra rules because I know him a little too well; he sees a loophole, he'll take it. I may have to houserule limitations as we go, and he knows that. But I'm hoping this is a good baseline. This is a pretty powerful ability, so I'm starting him off at a level deficit compared to the rest of the party. By how much, I'm not sure. But he came up with a very good backstory for his character, and we're both big fans of Fullmetal Alchemist. So, I'm hoping that this doesn't bite me in the butt. Thoughts? Critique? Too complicated, or any loopholes I should close? Let me know if you see any!"
315,vulnerability,DnD,Is it BS to tell a cleric that their Remove Curse spell does not remove all curses?,228,6cubth,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6cubth/is_it_bs_to_tell_a_cleric_that_their_remove_curse/,2017-05-23 22:27:36,"Recently my group came into contact with the Armor of Vulnerability. It was the first cursed item that they had found and I made the mistake of telling the cleric that the armor was cursed as soon as he attuned to it (rookie mistake, first time DMing a campaign). I should have let him figure it out himself that something was wrong with the armor after getting into a fight or something but I didn't. My question is, is letting a Cleric remove pretty much every curse from a person a good idea? I know that is what the spell is supposed to do, but it feels like it takes the fun out of getting cursed. When they figure out something is wrong with an item, the cleric can just cure themselves and their party members and then effectively ignore the item. **Edit:** For the people saying that cursed items suck and aren't fun ect. I get it. But if one of my PCs decides 'Hey lets wear this pristine set of plate armor that I found in an abandoned devil/demon encampment' then it's their own fault for putting on devil armor. **Edit 2:** This is my fault for not wording the initial post properly, but I know that Remove Curse unattunes you from the item and allows you to take it off and restores you to normal, as if you had never attuned to the item in the first place (mostly). If this item was a quest item I would straight up say no, but the topic is regarding basic cursed items from the DMG. **My problem is there doesn't seem to be enough of a punishment for players who attune to these items and then remove the curse as soon as they discover it, especially when they just run up and grab it without looking too much into it (especially when they found it in a devil/demon encampment).** Now my favourite response to this problem is setting a DC for remove curse, which I would base off of how much the cleric knows about the object, lowering it if they are familiar, raising it if they have no clue. Obviously this is all up to personal preference, some think the original rules are good enough which is fine, but I think putting a hurdle that doesn't 100% guarantee a cleric will succeed would make the rash decisions of PCs matter a bit more. **Edit 3:** A quick FYI, I did let the player remove the armor when he cast remove curse. All this stuff I asked is for future reference of how I handle these situations which I will let my players know about."

317,vulnerability,DnD,D&amp;D 5e Naga Race + Bard Witch Subclass i made for my gf,7,6du9ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6du9ig/dd_5e_naga_race_bard_witch_subclass_i_made_for_my/,2017-05-29 01:12:50,"This is my first post on reddit, sorry if the layout is a bit shite, as for the home-brew, im still balancing it as we go. My gf asked me if she could play a ""watery dark magic user with music and stuff"" so i started home-brewing, the result is quite fun, but im unsure as to how balanced it is. We are currently running the Princes of the apocalypse campaign. Firstly, the Witch Bard subclass: The Witch Some individuals that have been exposed to a great amount of shadow magic or another dark influence gain ruinous powers over time, this power, however, often comes with a price. Restriction: With DMs permission only (home-brew) Unless otherwise stated all rules for bardic inspiration still apply as normal. Bonus proficiencies. At 3rd level you gain the following proficiencies: One weapon of your choice, One tool of your choice and One skill of your choice. Arcane focus. At 3rd level you gain proficiency in the usage of arcane focuses. Dark influence. At 3rd level you gain access to all spells of the necromancy school when choosing spells through your base class. These spells count as bard spell for you. You also learn the Thaumaturgy cantrip if you dont already know it, if you do, you learn the Dancing lights cantrip. Witchcraft. Also at 3rd level you gain the ability to add your inspiration die to anyones HP as temporary health, this health takes the form of a magical shield that has resistance to necrotic and vulnerability to radiant damage. Using inspiration like this counts as an action or reaction. The increase to HP lasts for 10 minutes and cant exceed your Charisma ability score + your proficiency modifier. Spell flurry. Starting at 6th level if you cast a cantrip as an action, you can cast another (or the same cantrip) as a bonus action. Alternatively, when you cast a spell of first level or higher as an action, you can consume an inspiration dice to cast a cantrip as a bonus action. Soul magic. At 14th level you unlock dark secrets that allow you to use your own life essence as fuel to bolter yourself and your allies. You can convert your bard hit die (d8) into inspiration die as a bonus action or reaction (or as a free action if used with Spell Flurry), immediately assigning a target. Doing so consumes the hit die like normal usage would and deals twice the rolled amount in psychic damage to yourself. Secondly, The Naga race Naga (Work in progress, home-brew) The Naga are a proud and cultured race of half humanoid half serpentine people that live in cities deep underneath the oceans of the world they inhabit. Naga traits Age: Nagas reach maturity slightly earlier than humans and can live up to around 150 years Alignment: The Naga are strict in their doctrine, yet expressive in their culture, they tend to be Lawful and find things like good and evil to be subjective. Size: The Naga can reach up to 14 feet long (from the head to the tip of the tail), yet when standing straight they are about 7 feet high. Your size is medium. Speed: Your base walking speed is 25, yet your swimming speed is 50. Water breathing: You can breathe underwater as if it was air and can cast spells underwater. Ability score increase: your dexterity score increases by 1. Tail grapple: Whenever you grapple something you can use your hands as normal, for you are using your mighty tail, your speed becomes 0 while using your tail to grapple. The grappled target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage every turn due to its bones being crushed from the constriction. Tidecaller: You can cast the Shape Water cantrip at will. At 3rd level you can cast the Create or Destroy Water spell once per long rest. At 5th level you can cast the Wall of Water spell once per long rest. Sub-Races: Naga of the prime material plane: After The Grand Divide the golden Naga of Nazjatar focused on religion and culture. Creating a beautiful underwater empire where legendary paladins and bards were born. However, The Grand Divide also left a dark mark upon their philosophy, these gentle golden serpent-folk despise the dark arts, and by extend the Naga who follow the way of the Serine Shadow. Appearance: These Naga are famed for their beautiful golden scales and rich culture. Ability score increase: your charisma increases by 1 Religious doctrine: you gain proficiency in the Religion Skill Languages: Common, Celestial Naga of the Feywild: After The Grand Divide caused by the differing ideologies of The Proud Light and the Serine Shadow, about half of the population left for the Feywild through a portal created by the Elder Nashgeth. Over the years the Naga of the Feywild have adapted to their highly mystical surroundings, for the Feywild is a world woven of the arcane. Appearance: Their scales have a silver-ish hue due to their long exposure to the unending dusk of the Feywild. Ability score increase: your wisdom increases by 1 Depths of reality: you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill Languages: Common, Sylvan "

They were recently tracking a chain devil that had some history with two of the members of the party. They managed to find its old lair from before it was sent back to the Nine Hells. The devil was there and after some exposition and them taking a few swipes at it they realized it was an illusion and the devil was basically trying to get insight into their approach to taking him down. After the frustrating realization that they had been played they searched the room and I told them along with the plot progressing hints there was a suit of armor in the corner on a stand. Without hesitation one of the players puts it on even though they knew the devil was expecting them. It was armor of vulnerability (resistance to bludgeoning, vulnerability to piercing and slashing). All he had to say is ""That makes my AC 20 right?"" (18 + paladin defensive style + dual weilder). So next session they plan to go fight this chain devil wearing armor that is specifically vulnerable to the types of damage done by said devil. Should be fun. "
322,vulnerability,DnD,The Deck of Infinity (5e),14,6hbsuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6hbsuq/the_deck_of_infinity_5e/,2017-06-15 10:58:42,"TLDR: I created a deck of cards based off of the idea of the deck of many things, however I wanted to Tone it down a bit and make it a little less dangerous but without taking away the spirit of what's it trying to do. I'm about half way done I would love suggestions and critiques. The deck is at the very bottom Amongst the dragon's hoard you find a small wooden box, Barely larger then a dwarven fist. The box is a dark wood (Teak DC10 Nature) and cheaply made; there's a lock embedded inside the wood keeping it latched closed, a DC10 Athletics check or DC10 Thieves tools would open the box revealing a deck of cards inside. The deck seemed to have passed many hands as the colors are dilapidated and faded; the cards seem to stick together but can be pulled apart if attempted. If the cards are pulled apart The Person done so activates the magic of the deck and they're Teleported to a pocket dimension. If the party tries to use detect magic they'll sense the following Schools of magic coming from the box; Illusion magic &amp; Conjuration. If Identify is used on the box they'll read this ""A magical Deck of cards; Pull a card, it won't kill you I promise."" If dispell magic is used on the deck of cards the cards will then show (once identify is cast) Deck of Infinity: A gate to a pocket dimension similar to Magnificent Mansion spell in the guise of a deck of cards. Once a card is pulled the target is teleported to the Pocket dimension; The Cards renew the illusion magic hiding it's true purpose every dawn. If someone tries to counter spell the teleportation they may do so at a DC15. Once Inside the Pocket Dimension The character(s) will see a darkly lit hallway, behind them is one of the two light sources in this room; A Ten foot tall door that holds a still image of the world they've just left that lightly glows and shows the burgundy walls and the plum carpeting. Before them is the second light source a small candle that sits connected the wall, wax drips down into the bronze circular dish that holds it to the wall. Below the candle is another door. Any character will then hear a voice inside their mind that says, greets them and wishes them to come in. If Divine sense or similar abilities are used, they'll sense a Fiend&amp; a Celestial before them on the other side of the door. If the Character(s) Decide to press on they'll be greeted by a small room that's brightly lit with a huge display of colors. in the middle of the room will be a round table with comfortable chairs surrounding it, in one of the chairs sits a humanoid, The race can be anything of your choice; However consistently The humanoid's left side has skin and (if the race has hair) ebony black hair usually slicked back, The right side is a heavenly with a glowing white. The hair (if any) is golden. The eye on the right is black like obsidian with cracks of orange or red like cooling magma. The eye on the left is pure white with a single thing golden band for the pupil. Chance will be smiling and friendly Candidly answering any of their questions on where they are (Pocket dimension under his control) what he is, (the unfortunate mix of a angel and a devil.) and what he wants. He wants to play a game with the party, The game is simple; Each member becomes a contestant, and will pull a card from Chance's deck; He states that they are free to decline however someone will have to take their card. Once a card is pulled they're free to leave. If all decline he will do one of two things (if party is good) he wills state that whomever finds this box next will have to pull a card for each of them regardless of outcome, and who gets this next could be anyone... (if evil) He'll Pull a card at random, regardless of the card pulled the card will be a blessing card in the form of gold in large sack, they'd state, ""Shame for blessings to go to waste, oh well... here you go random person and the bag of gold disappears."" Chance is The Unholy (literally) union between a Deva and a Eriyes; Because of the unusual lineage it's granted him the ability to communicate with the the circles of hell and the Holy pantheon, The gods are too powerful to enter the mortal realm, however Chance is just small enough to sneak into the cracks of the realms and go where it pleases. After exploring the different dimensions, it's devilish nature started to permeate and Chance wished to send curses amongst the realms, however not being wholly bad he also wished to spread blessings but not being powerful enough to provide these curses himself he created a small plane of existence right outside the mortal plane where he Devils and angels can provide blesses or curses to those who enter; But the only way to truly &amp; fairly divvy out these curses and blessings was by.. chance.

Chance's spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). Chance can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components: At will: detect evil and good, Commune 1/d Planar Shift, Resurrection (self Only) Magic Resistance: Chance has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. ACTIONS Multiattack. Chance makes two melee attacks. -Rapier Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. Hit: 8 (1d8+ 4) Piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) Radiant or Fire damage. -Change Shape: Chance magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (Chance's choice). In a new form, Chance retains its game statistics and ability to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and special senses are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it lack. REACTIONS Parry. Chance adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Chance must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

323,vulnerability,DnD,Forbidden Spells of the Book of Vile Darkness,3,6hp5hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6hp5hv/forbidden_spells_of_the_book_of_vile_darkness/,2017-06-17 06:30:08,"So the DMG says that the book of Vile Darkness can contain evil spells of the DM's making. So I made some. I wrote them all on a google dog which I will copy paste here. I don't know if the formatting will get screwed up or not, so, yeah... Here's what's in the doc: --- Some spells are so vile and evil that they are never meant to be seen by the world. Only those with the blackest of souls and emptiest of hearts can even attempt to learn such a spell, much less use it. Unfortunately for the world, Vecna was such a person. Sometime between Vecnas rise to lichdom and his death and the hands of Kas, Venca wrote a book called the Book of Vile Darkness (DMG. 222-224). Inside he scribed the foulest secrets and truths known to him. In his death, his cults have added onto the book, making it a vault of impure knowledge. Some of the spells written within have never been used before, and thus are scribed here to explain the full extend of their powers The DMG states that the book can contain some of the darkest spells in existence, which can be made from the DMs imagination. So here are some spells that I have come up with to be used with the book. I am bad at balancing, so I am going to try my best to fit them with the level that fits them best, but dont be surprised if an 8th level spell is as powerful as a 9th level spell or visa versa. Also, this being an artifact and whatnot, expect most spells to be high leveled. Not all spells listed here may be accessed by reading the book, the DM can pick and choose which ones the player finds. --- Crucio 9th-level necromancy (ritual) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 20 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, up to 13 years This spell causes the target to be cursed with an unfathomably strong curse. This curse can not be removed by greater restoration or any weaker magic. Only Wish can forcibly dispel the curse. The caster can choose to dispel the curse at any time, and the curse does away at the end of 13 years. One target the cast can see must take a WIS and CON save. Upon failing either save, the target is cursed. While the target is cursed in the manner, writhing tendrils of shadow latch onto and attack. Each round, the target takes 1d4 psychic damage and is stunned by unimaginable pain, but can still speak normally. The caster can choose to forfeit the psychic damage, still keeping the immense pain and stun. If the target takes damage (including the psychic damage), they get a WIS save. If they pass the save, the caster gets one level of exhaustion. If the target is cursed for a full 24 hours, the spell no longer needs concentration, but still has the 13 year duration. If the target failed both saves, the caster can choose to up the damage to 2d10 psychic damage. If the target only failed one of the saves, the caster has disadvantage concentration saves to keep the curse going. --- Mosmorde 7th-level Conjugation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 90 feet Components: S, M (A piece of charcoal, a skull, and a petrified eye of Newt) Duration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes Choose one location within 90 feet of the caster in the air to summon the dark mark. The mark appears as a 3 foot diameter black skull made of darkness and shadow. All creatures who do not know the spell within 60 feet of the mark must take a WIS save. On a failed save the target takes 3d8 psychic damage and is frightened of the mark. While within 60 feet the frightened creatures must their full speed to get as far away from the mark as possible. The only action the frightened creatures can make is the dash action. Creatures who still succeed the save are subject to the Hex spell. The concentration of this spell is the same concentration for Hex. --- Bane of Orcus 9th-level Evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 300 feet Components: V, S, M (A chalice of gold worth at least 1000 gp filled with holy water, which the spell consumes) Duration: Instantaneous All Undead within 300 feet of the caster are subject to Power Word Kill. Upon casting the caster takes 10d10 radiant damage due to the sheer power needed for the spell.

The shard counts as an improvised weapon, but does piercing damage. On hit, the target takes an extra 2d10 necrotic damage, and takes a CON save. On a failed save, the target takes another 2d10 necrotic damage as a piece of their soul gets trapped in the crystal shard. The shard turns deep purple, becoming a Soul Shard. The Soul Shard can not be used as a component for this spell. The Soul Shard has an AC of 15 and 20 HP. If the creature whose soul is trapped in the shard is still alive, if any damage is done to the shard half goes to the shard and half goes to the creature whose soul is trapped. If the creature dies, they can not be brought to life by any means, except by the person who holds the shard. If the shard is destroyed, the creature can be brought back to life. --- Call Undeath 9th-level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: 300 feet Components: V, S Duration: Instantaneous You conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points (see the Monster Manual for statistics).

Upon casting the caster takes 10d10 necrotic damage due to the sheer power needed for the spell. The spell goes through even if the caster dies to this damage. --- Bind Soul 5th-level Necromancy (ritual) Casting Time: 1 action Range: 5 feet Components: V, M (Another creature) Duration: Until broken You and another willing creature swear a dark oath to each other, whispering dark secrets and forgotten truths, which binds your souls together. Any bound creature can only be bound to one other creature at once). This oath can be broken by either creature at any time. While bound in this way, the two creatures can not harm each other in any way. They can not force each other to make saving throws. They also can communicate telepathically at any distance. They can feel what each other feels, and it is as if both targets are connected via Warding Bond. --- Far Intervention 9th-level Conjugation Casting Time: 1 action Range: 100 feet Components: V, S Duration: Concentration, 1 minute This spell opens a portal to the Far Realm. The portal is a circle 100 feet in diameter, with the caster standing at one end. There must be enough space for the full portal to form. Anyone within 10 feet of the edge of the portal is pulled in, and the caster is pulled in when the duration or concentration ends. All creatures that do not enter the portal at the end of the duration within 500 feet take 20d20 psychic damage. This spell can only be cast by the same person once every 289 years when the universe falls into chaos. WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS SPELL! IT HAS ONLY BEEN ATTEMPTED ONCE BEFORE. THE WORLD THAT IT WAS USED IN NO LONGER EXISTS. --- Undead Rot 6th-level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: 300 feet Components: V Duration: 1 week You whisper a vile curse and the target must take a CON saving throw or have their body begin to swell with bulges of rot and dead flesh.

They also have disadvantage on all saving throws, and vulnerability to slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage. Any Medium or Heavy armor they are wearing breaks when they deform, but Light armor stays intact. The target also gets a +2 AC. --- The Art of Killing Gods 9th-level Evocation Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: S, M (a weapon that has been bathed in the blood of a Titan) Duration: Instantaneous Make a melee attack against a Demon Lord, Archdevil, God, Demi-God, or something with the Titan tag. Upon hit, apply an extra 100 damage of the weapons type. This damage counts as if it was coming from a magic weapon. --- Plague of 10,000 Deaths 9th-level Necromancy Casting Time: 1 action Range: Touch Components: S Duration: Until conditions met, or flower destroyed Touch a living flower to fill it with the most foul of necrotic energy. The flower morphs into a beating black heart. The flower has 100 hp, can not attack, and is immune to all damage except radiant. After 1 day, it produces a small black cloud around it that heavily obscures the area. For each day after that, the cloud expands by 1 mile in all directions. Any non-undead creature in the cloud must take a CON save every minute or die from the gas inhalation. Any non-undead creature that does not need to breath must take a CON save every long rest taken in the cloud, or take 5d12 necrotic damage. Plants immediately wither and die while within the cloud. Any spell that restores HP can remove a 30 by 30 foot section of the cloud, which will reform the following day. Greater Restoration will prevent the cloud from reclaiming that section for a week. The cloud goes away once the flower is destroyed. The flower will also self-destruct once the cloud has killed 10,000 creatures. Once a creature casts this spell, they can not cast it again for 25 years and 1 day."

325,vulnerability,DnD,Critique My Campaign Story,1,680mp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/680mp2/critique_my_campaign_story/,2017-04-28 13:20:41,"Hey there Reddit, I'm currently apart of my D&amp;D club at college, and next semester I'm hopefully going to be DMing a nice, long, pretty decent campaign. I've coalesced some of my ideas here, and I'd really like your feedback. I'm most concerned about the malleability of the campaign, leaving room for my PCs to explore and shape the story themselves, rather than me trying to force them to keep on track. What I'll write below, after a hopefully brief section on the home-brewed world, will contain some major setpieces that I want to include. ~~Hopefully none of my future players regularly browse this subreddit~~ Tentatively titled ""The Earth and the Fae"", my setting is going to be a home-brew. There are several things to note about it that may differentiate it from other settings. The first thing is this dichotomy of the Earth, or our material plane, and the Fae, which functions as an ethereal plane. Most races are either from the material world (humans, dwarves, haltings, etc) or crossed over from the Fae at some point in history. The original elves cross over in the First Pilgrimage, the Drow cross over in the Second, and the tieflings cross over in the Third. (The tiefling 'pilgrimage' was more of an invasion, and led to the closing of the major doorways between the two realms and left the tieflings stranded here, cut off from the 'grace of the face'). Beyond that, there is a Heavenly Plane where major deities live and the Hell Plane were evil major deities live. My pantheon takes several deities from various settings (Bahamut, Pelor, Raven Queen, etc) and labels them as Major Gods like the Valar from the Silmarillion. Minor deities, like Tolkien's Maiar, dot the landscape of both the Earth and the Fae, usually confining themselves to a certain region, like the Kami of Japanese folklore. Clerics can only seek help from the Major gods, as the minor gods influence is limited. The Void is a plane of existence inspired by the vestiges from the binder class in 3.5. It's essentially a plane of absolute nothing (literally just a void) and is used as a prison for beings who manage to piss off both the gods of good and the gods of evil. The world of the Earth and the Fae is extremely cosmopolitan, in a similar vein of the Star Wars universe. Creatures of all races mingle and mix, including traditionally uncommon ones like the Kenku and Goliaths from Volo's or the Eladrin and Aasimar from the DMG. Humans aren't the dominant people in my setting; to be quite honest, no one is. While nations have tended to form around racial lines, for the most part everyone mixes pretty well. This is meant to allow my PCs to be adventurous when choosing a race and cut back on 'special snowflake syndrome'. The campaign my players will be apart of is concerned with the border region between two countries. One is a multiracial theocratic empire, devoted to an as yet unnamed Lawful Good deity, which in practice makes the Empire more lawful than good. The empire is not only a major regional political, military and economic power, it is notable for its strict oppression of other forms of worship and it's tight control over the magic-wielding population. Church sanctioned Inquisitors act as mage hunters, tracking and abducting apostates to work in the Imperial Circle of Magi, where mages operate under the watchful eye of the state in the military or for technological advancement. The neighbor to this Empire is a rogue nation that seceded from the Empire several decades ago, over the treatment of magic users. Rausten established itself as a safe haven for unsanctioned mages and promoted religious tolerance. The Empire didn't take too kindly to this, and fought a hard war to maintain control. The only reasons Rausten survived were due to it's relative isolation from the rest of the Empire, and the natural barrier between the two- a massive, treacherous, and mostly uncharted mountain range that separates the two countries geographically. Since the Empire's strategic defeat, the two countries have engaged in a difficult cold war lasting many decades. The Empire is unable to accept the embarrassment of a seceding nation, as Rausten's very existence threatens the Empire's control over their country and legitimacy on the world stage, and has vowed to reunite the two in order to reassert its declining power. Recently, a private firm from the Empire called the Redstone Charter Company has declared it's intent to establish colonies on the border in order to exploit the region for it's rich natural resources. The party opens as hired muscle for one such colony, to act as freelance guards, workers, and prospectors in this strange new land. The colony has been established, and the party tags along with a convoy of supplies and reinforcements leaving from the nearest city. En route to the colony, the party notices strange things afoot in the mountains. A heavy, supernatural mist blankets the mountains, but the air is still. There is no wind. There are no signs of any animal life- the only sound is the rustle of the wagons as they trudge along the narrow mountain path. In this travel time to the colony, there are several things that I want to happen to move the plot along. The first is an attack on the convoy along this narrow path by a group of rabid kobolds, led by a massive Dragonborn with black eyes. It's up to the players to not only defeat the kobolds, but ensure the survival of the vital supplies in the convoy. The second is an encounter with an ancient blue dragon, who questions the party about their encounter with the black dragonborn. Should they fail to answer to his satisfaction, he will attack and the group will be forced to flee. Should they converse successfully, he will give them a strange blue orb and demand that it be delivered to the chieftain of a clan of wood elves camped outside the Redstone Colony. Big Blue is puzzled by the appearance of unique dragonspawn in his mountains, as the ones he has encountered seem mindless and filled with rage. Continuing on their journey, the party will be attacked again, this time by a band of very angry wood elves, who quickly overwhelm the party and end up separating them from the convoy, which, depending on their actions, may get away, or may not. (there is room in here for the party to be captured, giving them an opportunity to escape the wood elf camp). Regardless of the outcome, the party is lost in the mountains with little to no food. Eventually they'll stumble upon another clue regarding the mystery in thee mountains: a slain human surrounded by dozens of dead kobolds. The human is a messenger, and in his bag is a coded letter than only reads, ""Project Firewall: Phase 1 complete. Initiating Phase 2."" Sometime, they'll be attacked by the first wild animals they've seen thus far: a pack of ravenous wolves. The wolves will overwhelm them, and they'll probably be saved by the timely arrival of anther band of wood elves, this one friendly. These elves explain their situation thusly: The leader of these Elves, a woman named Lacombe, is technically the chieftain of the clan native to this forest. Their clan worships a minor deity who resides in the forest, the wolf god named Moro. Moro, angry at the presence of the Imperial colony, led Lacombe's clan in a battle against the colonists. During the battle, Moro was injured by a strange new weapon and the elves were defeated. Moro's injury has changed her. Lacombe claims that she is no longer the god she knew. Since the battle, the mountains had experienced a blight: all beasts, on land, in the water, in the sky, had fled. Her clan druid, Suvin, usurped control, blaming the blight on the colonists and claiming that he could use Moro's new power to destroy them. Lacombe, for doubting the Suvin's interpretation of will of Moro, was Eomer'd from the clan, along with a dozen or so of her supporters. The elves that attacked the convoy were Suvin supporters, who were currently laying siege to the colony. Lacombe will lead the party through the wilderness, but refuses the blue Macguffin sphere, claiming she does not know what it is. Regardless, she will hold the player's oath to deliver it fulfilled, lest they risk the wrath of the blue dragon. Along the way, the group is harassed by one or more bands of kobolds and dragon born, all equally mindless and violent. At the colony, the party will get to see firsthand the conflict between the colonists and the elves. The colony rests upon a hill next to a lake, similar to Irontown from Princess Mononoke (You'll notice I also borrowed the wolf god Moro from the movie as well, and I'm about to borrow more.) The colonists are armed with an experimental new weapon enabled by their new iron mines: firearms, and gunpowder. Despite their much lower numbers, the colonists have successfully repelled every elf attack up until this point, and Moro's wound originates from a bullet from one of these firearms. Then we see what Suvin means by Moro's 'new power'. Though the wolf god herself is not present, Suvin invokes her name, and transforms several of his followers into werewolves, right there on the battlefield. The beasts resist the silver-less missiles of the firearms, and make significant headway against the colonies defenses. The party's job is to make it to the colony in one piece, and try and assist in repelling the werewolf attack. Once inside the colony, the party meets Hal, a half-elf and the leader of the colony's chartered militia, as well as Boom, a Kenku artificer and the mastermind behind the local design of the firearms, and Hal's lieutenant (for the sake of ease, I'm ignoring Kenku lore about forced mimicry and lack of creativity.) Lacombe has left, having fulfilled her oath to deliver the party to the colony. Hal explains the colony's precarious position- with no game to hunt and their town under constant siege by the elves, they're running low on supplies. The party's convoy was vital to the colony's continued survival. Without it, odds are slim they'll have enough food to make it until the next shipment without some difficult losses. If pressured, Hal can admit the true nature of the colony- Redstone Charter is just a front for the Empire's secret agenda. The 'colonies' Redstone is establishing are meant to act as forward operating bases for a renewed invasion of Rausten. With supplies low and the next convoy destined to be overtaken by the elves, Hal proposes a daring plan to eliminate Moro and castrate the wood elves' ability to carry on their guerrilla attacks. And what do you know, the most well-rested and best-equipped group of adventurers with nothing to lose just arrived. In the intervening time between the party's arrival and subsequent departure from the colony on their new mission, they have a chance to explore the town, stock up on items, and even meet the Blue dragon again, who has taken a blue-themed human form in order to blend in. If the party didn't get the blue macguffin sphere before, they will get it now. The mission to kill Moro will take the party back into the wilderness, hopefully more prepared and higher leveled after maybe one or two side quests. Hal's intel will point them in the direction of the shrine to Moro, which also happens to be the cave where she lives and the home camp for Suvin's wood elves. En route, they'll encounter Lacombe again, who begs them to spare Moro's life and try to find a way to heal her. If the wolf god dies, there's a chance everything in the local ecosystem that depended on her presence will die off as well- her injury was enough to cause a blight. The battle at the shrine will serve as the party's first real dungeon. They'll encounter wolves, wood elf rangers and druids, werewolves, and occasionally kobolds and dragon born, who seem eerily eager to defend Moro from the party. When they finally encounter Moro, the wolf god will be on her side, near death and unable to fight. Should the party choose to kill her, Lacombe will turn against them. Should they choose to spare the wolf god, Suvin will appear and try to stop them. Moro, however, like Lacombe said, is not herself. Her injury has opened her up and left her vulnerable in her angered state, and her extreme emotional and physical vulnerability has left a gap for Grazzt, a demon prince seeking a way to escape the void and ascend to heaven, to slip in and assume control over the wolf god's body. His power gave Suvin's followers the ability to turn into werewolves. But Grazzt's control over Moro is weak, as she is still deeply wounded by the bullet in her shoulder. The party fights a severely weakened manifestation of Grazzt, aided somehow by the presence of the blue macguffin sphere. Moro can either be killed, sending the ecosystem into a spiral; spared, allowing her to succumb to her death and again sending it into chaos; healed, which purges Grazzt from her body and restores the natural order; or replaced by the ascension of either Lacombe or Suvin to her position as patron deity of the forest, allowing them to enter Moro's physical body and again purge Grazzt and keep the balance of nature. Should Moro die, the wood elves wouldn't ally themselves with the party and will leave the mountains in exile. If she stays or is replaced, the wood elves will try to keep the peace with the colonists to pay their debt to the party. (Again, this is flexible. I just want there to be some planned options, but if PCs have other plans, I won't keep it this rigid.) Grazzt himself won't completely disappear. It will become evident to the party that Moro's anger alone wasn't enough to summon Grazzt from the void- he would have had to already be on the material plane to possess her, even in a moment of weakness. A rogue demon prince is bad, bad news. Upon returning to the colony, the party again encounters a few bands of kobolds and dragon born, who still seem wild and mindless. A few, however, seem to show signs of intelligence, as leaders of the bands. Their eyes are completely black, just as Moro's eyes were when possessed by Grazzt. Back at the colony, should the party seek help from any arcane expert who happens to live there, said wizard will ask to study the blue macguffin sphere, no questions asked. Hal will have a captive dragon born to interrogate, and the dragonborns answers under interrogation lead the party to a secret base not far from the colony. Upon infiltration of said base, the party will encounter regular patrols of kobolds and dragon born, who appear to be much more intelligent than those previously encountered, along with other guards with no identifying markings on their shields or armor. Whatever is going on here, whoever is in charge doesn't want you to know who they are. The party will come across several dragon fetuses gestating in giant transparent vats to simulate eggs, as well as many other kobolds and dragon born being grown in test-tube environments. Several open logbooks and scattered journals will confirm the site's name as the base of Project Firewall. I'd like the party to overhear a conversation between two mages who seem to be in charge of Project Firewall. It will be revealed that this operation is actually a secret initiative by the government of Rausten to genetically engineer dragons that will act as a deterrent against a potential Imperial invasion. Project Firewall is Rausten's equivalent of the Manhattan Project. The kobolds and Dragonborn are genetic byproducts of their experiments. Fortunately, the Project seemed to have been stalled; they can't control the dragons they grow, and using them as a deterrent won't work if they deal just as much damage to Rausten as they do to the enemy. Unfortunately, a lower-level gnome wizard and project worker named Bartleby Cladminius had an idea to control the dragons- bind them to an extraplanar entity, for example, one trapped in the Void, like a certain demon prince, Grazzt. By spreading Grazzt's consciousness over the spare bodies of the dragon born and the kobolds, as well as other dragon bodies, they could keep him diluted enough to maintain control. And it gets worse. Grazzt is much stronger than the Project workers estimated. Not only can the Rausten mages not control Grazzt, but he's able to extend his consciousness further and retain complete control over every single host body created by the project. They just allowed a demon prince to not only enter the material plane, but they gave him an army of dragons to control to boot. This is where the campaign climaxes. Grazzt's dragons revolt against the Project firewall workers, and break out of the base. Their first target: the Redstone colony. I'd like the final battle will be the siege of the colony by Grazzt draconic horde. While Grazzt may have numbers, the colony has advanced weapons and (depending on player actions) the support of the wood elf clan. Eventually, when Grazzt big dragon shows up, the local ancient blue dragon will arrive to match it, with some help from the players. The coup de grace, however, will be the blue macguffin sphere. The wizard theorizes that it's actually a kind of extradimensional doorstop, that has the ability to close off the different realms from one another. If anyone in the party can activate it, it will close Grazzt's door into our world, and return him to the void from whence he came. In the aftermath of the battle for the Redstone colony, the convoy from the Empire will finally arrive. And it's not just food and supplies this time. Imperial soldiers and church inquisitors arrive as well, some armed with the new firearms technology that was so effective against the traditional armaments of the wood elves and the draconic hordes. Hal's story of the Empire's plan to invade Rausten is validated. Without dragons as a deterrent and their protective mountain range colonized, Rausten is as defenseless as it's ever been. In a twist to the gut of any good-aligned character, the recently arrived Imperial General will offer his thanks for the removal of the dragon problem, and for enabling the Empire to keep their foothold in the mountains and almost certainly dooming Rausten to a lightning war. So, the party saves the world from a demon prince with a dragon army, but might have just enabled another potentially equally as bloody land war between a declining regional superpower with advanced weaponry and a desperate survivor nation of powerful mages. Let me know of any feedback you deem necessary. As I've said, what I have here are some of the main set pieces and plot points I'd personally like to get to. But in my mind, my campaign is the destination; it's up to the players to make the journey. Thanks!"

Thoughts?",1,68juqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/68juqf/character_idea_the_familiar_is_the_main_character/,2017-05-01 13:48:51,"Hey guys. I'm looking for some feedback or ideas on how I might be able to create or sell a character to a DM for a campaign he's about to run. Basically, I want my main character to be a conciousness that is somehow trapped inside a ""familiar"" of sorts (whether that's an animal, or a golem, or something else) that is possessing humans and transferring his powers onto them. I hope to disclose this to the DM, but not my fellow players. My ""secret quest"" is to somehow get my body back, but possessing these other humanoids comes with it's own moral/ethical consequence. I expect that my character would need to be a spellcaster, as it makes more sense to be able to use my human as a conduit for my spells rather than trying to transfer some physical prowess onto them. Also, it could open doors for this curse to be self inflicted. Maybe I used to be super powerful but, in an effort for immortality or something, I sacrificed my body and turned into a level 1 cat. I expect that this idea fully requires me to sell it to the DM in advance, but what are some ways I can sell it? (as far as boons &amp; banes are concerned) Maybe if my human dies, I lose a level and have to charm someone new? Maybe, in order to sell that my character is older/grander in a crappy body, I'm forced to put my base skill proficiency into knowledge-based skills? Maybe I have some kind of extra vulnerability (a ""kryptonite"" of sorts) that makes it difficult to maintain the connection? Any feedback or thoughts are appreciated! I don't really expect this to be a super original idea, but it's something I thought about and I'm hoping to find some precedent to do it, whether it's through existing rules or just DM flexibility. edit: Also, I have no idea what edition of D&amp;D we're going to be playing. Probably 4 or 5."

So after half an hour or so i made this list of rules: Basic: The d20, Advantage &amp; Disadvantage, Ability Score, Skills, Saving throw, Passive perception, Attack Roll &amp; Damage, Armor class, Proficiency, Leveling Equipment: Weapons &amp; Armor, Language, Coinage, gems &amp; art objects, Food, drink and downtime Healing: HP &amp; Hit Die, Healing, Death saves, Temporary HP, Short &amp; long rest Character building: Race, Class, Background, Personality traits, Ideals, Bonds, Flaws, Inspiration, Leveling Combat: Suprise &amp; initiative, Turns, Move, Speed, Action, Bonus action, Reaction, Opportunity attack, Types of actions (Attack, Cast spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search), Cover, Natural 1/20, critical, Resistance, vulnerability &amp; imunity Spellcasting &amp; Spell slots Misc: Conditions, Exhaustion, Pantheons, Planes of existance I would explain the rules in the order i have written and I have purposefully left out some specific stuff like climbing, selling items and spellcasting so we can read that if wee need it. I would also like to hear from you if I left out something you think is important or if you think I should rearange the order somehow."

Maybe your character slid on some type of liquid such as the copious amounts of blood from the pile of bodies at your feet. Maybe you overextended on your strike and opened a potential vulnerability. This is why I like having the critical fumble in my combat. It adds a level of intensity to what is going on. Especially when my players are focused and intent on playing. So my solution involves no chart. No comic antics. Any adventurer, NPC, or enemy that rolls a Nat 1 while making a melee attack incurs an attack of opportunity with disadvantage. I haven't quite figured out an implementation that I am happy with for range. But my players like it a lot. Combat feels dangerous and it's a small minor risk/reward for each turn a character spends on melee. But doesn't punish my players for using the tools they have. Hopefully this helps other DMs out there. "

I wanted to see if this was a good way to balance it out to let them have this for thier character. A PC who gets infected with wolf lycanthropy makes thier strength score 15 if it isnt already. When they transform they get +1 AC but their armor and weapons dont transform with them, so they either drop it or cant use the form to its fullest being encumbered by stuff. They also get multiattack and resistance to B/P/S by nonmagical nonsilvered weapons. My idea was, what if instead of resistance to damage that isnt silvered, what if they just had vulnerability to silvered weapons? And instead of the multiattack they receive. they may make as many attacks in wolf form as they had in human form. Starting level 6 its gunna be tough finding an enemy who ISN'T using a magical or silvered weapon. They have 15 strength already and 15 AC as a druid with a wooden shield, so they would technically lose 1 AC when they transform. And with normal damage + vulnerability to guys that (may or may not) be prepared for a werewolf i dont see a problem with them being a werewolf. The only benefit they would get is advantage on hearing and smelling perception checks. **I think I'm gunna introduce them to both the shifter class and Matt Mercers blood hunter/oath of the lycanthrope. They can take thier pick there."

Lemme know what you think. Scorched Scorched are humans that came in contact with the Elemental Planes of Fire and Earth during a great war, where the strongest amongst them developed a fire in their eyes and veins. Appearance: Scorched have a skin colour akin to a full body sunburn, however without the scarring and have eyes which appear to be constantly slightly bloodshot. Their hair is always black or a deep brown. Ability Score Increase: Your life living in the heat makes you stronger, and your human nature gives you a versatility much needed in the ashen sands. Your Strength raises by +2, and two other abilities of your choice increase by +1. Age: As mostly humans, they have the same average life expectancy as humans. Scorched are required by necessity to start participating in communal work from much younger ages though. Alignment: Life in tight knit communities leads Lawful and Good alignments, although as they are still human, there are some that deviate from this. Size: Scorched tend to be slightly lighter and taller than most humans. Your size is Medium. Speed: As a Scorched, your blood moves quicker than most other races and this makes you more agile. Your walking speed is 35 ft, but if you take the Dash action, consider it 40. Boiling Blood: As your blood moves quickly, you bleed out much faster than most. Medicine checks used on you to stop your bleeding have disadvantage. Sandstorm Senses: You are used to your vision being impaired by the storms of your homeland. You can perfectly see things that are lightly obscured, and see things that are heavily obscured as if they are lightly obscured. Scavenging: Life in the desert relies heavily on surviving off the minute resources you can find. You have proficiency in Survival Gravity Step: You know how to manipulate the earth beneath your feet to propel your steps far forward. You gain +5 movement speed, however your steps boom through the earth, meaning others have advantage on Perception checks to find you that rely on hearing, and you have disadvantage on Stealth checks to avoid being heard. Desert Born: You have resistance to fire damage, and when you are in your homeland or a similar region, you have resistance to cold damage. Otherwise, you have vulnerability to the cold. Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common, and you can understand Primordial: Ignan and Terran. "

Usually when I introduce werewolves in my games I just don't have them bite players so that I don't have to deal with it, however I'm playing in a ""pass the DM"" style game and would like to be the one to introduce the mechanic so that it's not too over powered in the DM or player's favor. I feel like a charisma save is appropriate (resist against personality change), but other than that I don't know where to start. I don't know what DC is appropriate, 20-30 seems appropriate, but there are DC 19 saves in CoS that put you permanently under DM control, and that's for higher level characters. Does anyone have a mechanic that they use that I can bring to my table? Edit: Thanks for the suggestions guys, they've been helpful. My group isn't having fun with our current adventure (Storm King's Thunder), so we're going back to more of a homebrew sandbox game. 2 other players and I are going to be the rotating DMs with complete control over the world, which means I have the power to rework lycans into something more balanced and PC friendly. I'm thinking resistance to nonmagical weapons while shifted, vulnerability to silver, DC 15 Charisma save to resist shifting (and losing control) during a full moon, +1 to the DC for each time you've willingly shifted, DC resets once you've failed your save. Maybe -1 to the DC for each full month you've gone without shifting, DC resets once you willingly shift. I'll look at earlier edition stuff for cures and what not, remove curse seems too easy but wish seems too hard. Again, any suggestions and tips will be greatly appreciated."

Mummies are normally vulnerable to fire, but what if their bandages are coved in brown mold? You could remove the vulnerability to fire and perhaps give resistance. Obviously the mummy would have to be immune to cold damage or the mold, but the mold can be shed off after taking cold damage from another source. Perhap the mummies are frozen solid until a heat source comes close. *As you inspect the corpse covered in frost your torch light wanes and the brown growth expands. The frost cracks and the body lurches towards you.* Yellow mold is pretty easy since undead are immune to poison. Whenever the undead creature is dies it erupts in a cloud of spores for low CR challange for higher CR the creature are constantly sporing with an aura of poison. Here fire damage stops or suppress the mold cloud. *A noxious yellow cloud surrounds the ghouls. There are yellowish patches creating putrid sore in the gaunt flesh.* You could create green slime undead immune to acid damage. They are incredibly dangerous in melee range and destroy weapons used against them. Here the slime could be neutralize too with sunlight, radiant, or fire damage. *There is a crowd of oily green zombies that shamble through a doorway towards you. When the oily green goo on their bodies touches the wooden door and frame, or iron fixtures they corrode.*"
334,vulnerability,DnD,What do various creatures 'find distasteful' and do they cost money?,0,6698po,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6698po/what_do_various_creatures_find_distasteful_and_do/,2017-04-19 19:58:30,"So, I was reading the banishment spell (5th ed) and for the material components it says you have to use ""An item distasteful to the target"" and I'm like, 'whatever' cause nobody tracks spell components and you can just just a pouch or those crystal balls David Bowie (rip) had in Labyrinth. So then I was thinking of running CoS with vampires and werewolves and stuff. like they could steal their wands and shit so I wouldn't have to deal with Banishment during like a fight or something. It was gonna be one van hellsing of a good time. But then I was thinking later about this and I realized that werewolves don't like silver. like that is 'an item distateful to' them for the spell 'banishment' (it took me a while to think of this probs because I'm team Edward, but we are getting off topic). like every PC has like a bunch sp so, having a bunch of wolf-furries play fetch with their staves probably wouldn't work. but then I was like ""hold the phone, if sp are a spell component they technically would be a spell component with a cost which means an arcane focus wouldn't replace it."" Then I was all thinking of random tables of art objects and how druids dont like metal, and how barbarians used to destroy magic items for xp. Like Banishment is a complicated as f spell now. But like as I was looking this shit up and it was all super vague and confusing as it was written. Like you couldn't make a spell component less specific, 'distatesful to the target' could like literally be broccoli or something. So I did whatever I do whenever stuff in d&amp;d doesn't make sense, I checked an earlier edition. So in 3.5 Banishment is a little different and like the components that creatures dont give a bonus to DC to make it harder for the demon to resist. Literally something about a demon of darkness requiring, iron, silver, and a torch to get a +3 bonus (cold iron and silver for demons, torch for darkness). So right now I'm looking at this spell thinking, maybe, this stuff costs money for certain creatures. Maybe there is a list somewhere that has what creatures dislike in an earlier version of the spell (from my research, if the creature has a vulnerability or the item overcomes its damage resistance its basically 'an item the creature finds distasteful). **tl;dr** The spell *Banishment* has the spell component 'Material An item distasteful to the target', which is VERY vague. Some creatures (werewolves) don't like silver or expensive stuff, which *would cost money* to have. A spell component that costs money can not be replaced by a Arcane Focus (like a wand). Therefor the casting of the spell *Banishment* might cost money and might not use your arcane focus; The only hint towards this that I found was the 3.5 edition of the spell that has the material components be related to what the creature is weak to for damage resistance or other vulnerabilities. Does anyone have any more info or clarifications? Are their any other spells with vague spell components that I need to look out for?"

The party is by now freshly level 4 and entered a rather big city where I want to introduce them to a greater variety of stuff, except just uncommon magic items and the stuff from the PHB.

340,vulnerability,DnD,"5e(help) Vampirism, Long post",0,5pgyia,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5pgyia/5ehelp_vampirism_long_post/,2017-01-23 00:40:43,"So I have done a lots of looking through books, searching on the web, and can't find any good solution on how to give a PC the possibility of playing a Vampire. Now I thought to myself, surely there must be, since Lycantrophy is a thing. But no. So I decided to make a possible solution, combining vampire lore from many different places, and mashing it all together into a single ""template"" that one can add to a PC. Now the problem is the issue of balance, and fairness, you want to have the possibility to be the vampire that you have so many times read up on, but you don't want your party members to feel underpowered. So I ask you reddit to give me your opinion. *Disclaimer- I am not an english native speaker, so there might be some thing that end up weirdly explained, but I will correct things as they come. And this is all still a work in progress. Also I want this to be more of a story element, but something that also give the character some bonuses with all the negatives. Now, this is what I have so far: Prerequisites: Character lvl 5 or higher Charisma score of 13 or higher Must be a living race, and the same race as the vampire(half races either or works) Must be reduced to 0 hit points by a Higher Vampire(meaning, not a vampire spawn, but a ""pure"" vampire) So to make this work, vampirism, much like lycantrophy is a curse, but it still works differently. After being reduced to 0 hit points, the affected creature have 24 hours where they can still be ""resistant"" to the effect. The creature will have to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to feed, it does so with advantage if the possible victim is a friend(making it so the PC won't randomly kill its friend). It can be restrained in these 24 hours making it impossible to feed. A knowledge Religion check DC-something will tell you that this is possible. Now when the creature fails, and feed it will find somewhere to fall unconscious and let the transformation happen. Waking up at dusk the day after. So for the statistical changes; If you dont have darkvision, you now gain this, up to 60 feet(It might be able to give a creature with darkvision 120 feet instead, but that could depend on the DM) If you have resistances you change or gain it so that you have resistance necrotic damage, and vulnerability to radiant damage. Ex. You have resistance to fire damage, it now changes so that you have resistance to necrotic, and vulnerability to radiant damage. Skills or knowledges does not change from this curse, since you retain your personality. For the purposes of spells you now count as an undead. The creatures skin gets unnaturally pale, and you grow fangs. The fangs deal damage 1d4 + 1 necrotic damage, and can be used as a bonus action against a grappled target. (By feeding you regain half the amount of necrotic damage given) Unsure about this rule yet. The creature does not need to eat or drink ordinary food, but can decide to do so. Stats remain the same, this is a template, and not a racial change, otherwise this would be to OP. Then we of course have what the known flaws; A vampire cant enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. The vampire takes acid damage if it ends its turn in running water. Touching water, crossing water is fine, and ending your turn on running water is fine if you are on a raft, boat etc. A piercing weapon made of wood(stake) is driven into the vampires heart makes the vampire paralyzed and cant move until the stake is removed. If this happens while the vampire is in its resting place it is instantly destroyed. The vampire will take radiant damage when it starts its turn in sunlight, and will have disadvantage(The vampire can however use a clothing to hide its body from sunlight, he/she will only have this flaw if its skin comes in contact with direct sunlight) on attack rolls and Wisdom(perception) checks made against or toward a target in direct sunlight. The damage the vampire takes from running water or standing in direct sunlight = Level + Stage(this will effectively make it so a higher level character, and lower level character can feel the burn from this ability) I have made it so the PC vampire will have to cover itself in the day, but making him/her still able to move in daylight(I want to limit, but at the same time give opportunity). So for the base rules of the curse I have this; After being turned into a vampire, the creature starts off as a vampire spawn. The vampire will have to feed half its hit points of blood per week. Not feeding enough after a week the creature must succeed a Wisdom Saving Throw DC 15 + Stage of Curse, each day until it feeds. If the creature fails, it will next time it rest unconsciously hunt and feed drinking a sentient creature dry(resulting in that creatures death). If circumstances make it impossible to feed it start to starve as it has not fed in 3 days, and will not be satisfied until it has fed five times its normal feed amount. For each day without feeding the DC goes up by 1. I've come to a conclusion that the curse should have stages that through time the PC progress. This can either be through level caps, failing to feed and going ""feral"". I am thinking on adding a kind of blood hunger ability, that makes it so whenever the PC can't feed and results in losing his/her temper and sucks someone dry they gain a ""level"" in this ability. This could make it so depending on your blood hunger level, you have a higher DC to beat to not go ""feral"", increase the amount of blood the character needs per week, and eventually make it into a ""feral"" vampire, making him/her go entirely crazy, and for all intent and purposes is now a dead character, a NPC in the control of the DM. This will make it so the PC will keep feeding to not go insane, and help keeping balance, so that they don't lose their character. Also this might give them a reason to cure themselves of the curse. Now for the abilities that the vampire gets as it gains progression. Stage 1 - Vampire spawn. You can turn into a bat as an action, once. This ability can be used again after finishing a short or long rest(not that bad I think). Stage 2 - Vampire. You can cast spider climb once, this ability can be used again after finishing a long rest. You can cast Suggestion once per day, regaining this ability upon finishing a long rest. Stage 3 - Higher Vampire. You can cast Children of the Night, once per day, as in bestiary vampire ability. You can cast gaseous form twice per day, regaining this ability upon finishing a long rest. Stage 4 - Feral. You lose control of your character, and gaining all the benefits of a Vampire in the bestiary. The spellcasting modifier is Charisma for these abilities. Now what I am unsure of is how one should progress into gaining stages. I was thinking one could put a level cap on it, or maybe you have to kill another vampire and suck its blood to gain more power. Then of course we need the curse. We have the classical kill the vampire that turned you, but I think that a remove curse would be to easy(unless its within the first 24 hours) and since I have said that the body is undergoing a physical change. A wish spell would of course remove the curse, but I think it limits that to that. Then there is the question if killing the vampire that turned you really turns you back, I was thinking maybe give the player a choice. He/she can either chose to return, or still remain a vampire, rewarding them with something whatever they chose. I want to thank whomever take the time to read this post and might have something to say on the matter, every opinion is helpful Thank you"

Since higher level PCs can do this as well, combat strategy stops at ""what's the nearest thing I can kill"", regardless of class. Also, AC seems like a bit of an abstract simplification. So, here are my changes: [Link to these rules with the tables](URL **Overview:** All concepts of AC are discarded and replaced with an evade check and damage threshold (DT). In light of these changes, **PCs do not gain HP with level**, and monsters have much fewer hit points as well. **Evade check:** When you are attacked, or affected by a trap or spell requiring a DEX save, you roll an evade check. A successful evade check is equivalent to a missed attack, or avoided trap or spell. DEX save modifiers carry over to evade checks, but outside factors can also come into play. The DC for evading basic attacks is determined below. **Evade DC:** DC = 8 + attackers to hit bonus **Damage Threshold:** Armour, including monsters natural armour, provides damage threshold (see Armour DT tables and Monster stat conversions in the linked doc). Any damage under the threshold is ignored, while any greater than or equal to it is dealt in full to the HP of the affected creature. **Shields:** When holding a shield, you may use your reaction to add together your shield and armour DTs. That is your DT for that damage. **Effects granting extra AC:** In general, its pretty easy to tell if the effect would add to your AC by allowing you to endure a hit (such as Barbarians unarmoured defence or the Shield spell) or avoid a hit entirely (such as Monks unarmoured defence or the defensive fighting style). In the former case, double the bonus and add it to your DT. In the latter case, add it to your evade check bonus instead (unmodified). In some cases, like with defensive fighting style, the bonus may not apply in certain situations; it is very hard to parry a fireball, for instance. **Armour and evading:** Light or natural armour don't affect your evade roll. Medium armour gives disadvantage to the roll. Heavy armour causes automatic failure. **Attacks at advantage or disadvantage:** Attacks that would have been made at disadvantage (such as shooting from long range) now move the target one row up on the Armour and evading table, giving light armour wearers advantage (removing disadvantage from medium armour, etc.). Attacks that would be at advantage (e.g. a stab while undetected) now move the target down one row on the Armour and evading table, still scoring an automatic hit on heavy armour. Advantage and disadvantage still dont stack. **Critical hits:** When maximum damage is rolled on *all* spell or weapon damage dice from an attack, that hit is a crit. The damage ignores DT, and you may roll on the **Critical Hit Table** (in linked doc) for additional effects. Crits may be resisted by armour (see **Armour** under each crit table). **Ignoring DT:** Some damage ignores DT by nature, and that may be ruled by each individual DM (such as a poison prick on a trapped chest, or rot grubs burrowing into skin). **Poison** and **Psionic** damage also ignore DT. Note that if poison is to be administered via an attack, the attack must deal damage, lest the poison stop at the targets armour. **Rogue sneak attack** weapon and bonus damage with melee finesse weapons also ignore DT. **Critical hits** do as well, as mentioned previously. **Damage resistance and vulnerability:** Resistance and vulnerability modifiers on damage are applied after DT is tested. It is the creature itself which is resistant or vulnerable, not the armour. **Initiative:** Since dexterity now plays an even more pivotal role in combat, CHA is used to modify initiative rolls. Charisma represents confidence and control, and so is a fitting replacement. **Grappling and restraining:** Attacks on grappled creatures are made at advantage (see Attacks at advantage or disadvantage). Restrained creatures automatically fail their evade check, and cannot take reactions. **Full rationale/conclusion:** First of all, it makes sense. The king isnt invulnerable to your knife because hes a few levels higher than you. Plot out a good infiltration and assassination, and the king is dead. However, if you are caught, you dont easily beat the guards because theyre CR  and you have 84 HP. They can capture and kill you if you do not evade them. I think this system speaks more truly to D&amp;D. It allows for freedom and player consequence. Additionally, it allows for more teamwork in combat. A heavily armoured fighter can easily take on a swarm of goblins, but dont let them near your wizard; you need him to take out the chain-clad hobgoblin warlord. A constantly low health pool means you are always on your toes. Taking out the owlbear is no longer a simple HP trade, where the players know they win before it starts. An owlbear can still gorge you no matter how long youve studied the arcane arts. So instead, levelling allows for more opportunities in and out of combat, not a guaranteed win against weaker enemies. That opens up the wealth of monsters to players of almost any level. Dear level 20: swords still stab. "
342,vulnerability,DnD,[OC] Homebrew Cursed Ring: The Searing Band [5e],2,5q8rmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5q8rmx/oc_homebrew_cursed_ring_the_searing_band_5e/,2017-01-26 17:21:29,"I came up with an idea of a cursed ring for use in 5th edition D&amp;D that I thought might be fun to share for anyone to use in their own campaign. Not sure if there is an item like this already floating around the internet, but I personally enjoy cursed items as then can lead to fairly interesting and organic roleplaying experiences. The Searing Band (Requires Attunement) Item Description: (PC knowledge) A braided ring of dull iron bands bent into the rough shape of a ring. Once attuned, the ring emits a faint red glow along its braids and the wearer feels a constant, gentle burning sensation in the center of their chest. -The wearer of this ring gains resistance to fire damage -The ring can be used to emit an orange, burning light the equivalent of a single torch. -The Searing Band imbues any melee weapon, wielded in the same hand the ring is worn in, with searing fire, causing the weapon to deal an additional 1d4 fire damage on each hit. While the ring is worn and attuned, the wearer cannot defer this fire damage. -As an action, the wearer of this ring can use the Burning Hands spell once per long rest (DC: 15). (DM knowledge, cursed item) The Searing Band is an implement given out by the denizens of the Nine Hells as a means of binding others to their service, mortals in particular. The ring serves as a boon to their servants as well as a means of ensuring loyalty. The devil who originally gave out the ring is able to sense whenever the ring is attuned and to whom it is attuned. They can use the ring to communicate their desires and commands to the mortal by way of burning visions that show up in the wearer's dreams. Should the wearer decide to refuse these commands, the devil may choose to activate the ring, thus releasing the hounds of hell to hunt down the wearer ceaselessly and drag the wearer's screaming soul back to their fiendish master. Once the ring is activated by the devil, the wearer hears the distant, directionless sound of a baying hound for a few brief moments. The hellhound that has been released upon the wearer is drawn to the fiendish magic of the Searing Band and will hunt them down every night until they find the wearer. Once the ring is activated by its fiendish master, the DM must roll 1d6 every night until the hound finds the wearer. Each 5 or 6 rolled per night counts as 1 success for the hellhound in their pursuit of the wearer. Upon each success, the wearer of the ring hears the distant, directionless baying of the hellhound getting gradually closer for a few brief moments. Additionally, the gentle burning felt by the wearer increases in its intensity with each success. Nothing happens on a rolled 1 through 4. The hell hound finds the wearer and attacks them once they have had 5 successes, regardless of where they are. The number of successes accumulated by the hellhound is reset if the wearer spends 2 nights or more in another plane of existence, in which case the hellhound travels to the plane that the wearer is currently on in order to continue their pursuit. The wearer of the Searing Band may attempt a perception check to determine the source of the hounds baying if they should so desire. A successful check (DC set by DM) will serve to reassure the PC that the hound is far away and not an immediate threat. A failed check will result in the wearer being unable to determine how far away the hound is and how many hounds there are exactly. Lower rolls will disorient the wearer further, and you can feel free to do what you will with a natural 1. A natural 20 on a perception check will alert the wearer of a slight fiendish undertone to the hound's baying and will allow them to pinpoint how many hounds there are. Any other PC attempting a perception check to listen for the baying of the hound will be unable to hear anything from the hellhound, until the hellhound has 5 successes in its pursuit of the wearer. Once the hellhound encounter begins, the Searing Band begins to work against the wearer. The burning in the wearer's chest intensifies to an painful level. The braided iron bands twist and invert, revealing burning metal spikes that dig into the wearer's finger. While the hellhound is alive during this encounter, the Searing Bands properties change to the following: Searing Band (Spiked) -The wearer becomes vulnerable to fire damage. -The Searing Band cannot be removed, and any attempts to remove it causes the wearer to take 1d4 piercing damage and 1d6 fire damage. -The Searing Band still causes melee weapons wielded in the same hand as the ring to deal an additional 1d4 fire damage as normal. Additionally, whenever this damage is dealt, the wearer takes the same amount of fire damage (fire vulnerability still applies). -If the wearer should attempt to cast Burning Hands as they normally would using the Searing Band, they will instead cast the Fireball spell instead (DC: 15). -Vulnerability still applies to any fire damage incurred by the Searing Band. Once the encounter has begun, the hellhound will attack the wearer relentlessly until they are dead. Once the wearer is dead, the hellhound will collect their soul in a soul cage carried on their spiked collar and flee back to the nine hells to their master. If the hellhound is killed, the ring remains in its spiked form until the wearer takes a long rest, after which it reverts back to its non-spiked form and changing its properties back to normal (i.e. providing the player with the normal fire resistance, torchlight, bonus fire damage, and ability to cast burning hands). The ring cannot be activated again by its devil master for 1 week. The number of hellhounds sent after the specific wearer increases by 1 with each subsequent activation of the ring by the devil. If a player decides to unattune from the Searing Band while it has not been activated, the devil will be unable to activate the ring to send the hell hounds at them using the ring. However, if the player elects to unattune from the ring after it has already been activated by its devil master, the hounds will still pursue the wearer. If the hellhound rolls a 1 through 4, for 3 night, then it will stop its pursuit of the wearer. These rolls do not need to be consecutive. Additionally, if the ring is unattuned after it is activated by its devil master, the gentle burning in the wearers chest will persist until the hellhound is killed or until the hellhound stops its pursuit. The ring will not convert to its spiked form during the hellhound encounter, should it take place, if the ring is not attuned. I would encourage any DM using this item to tweak it as necessary to fit the needs of your campaign and to tailor the difficulty of the initial and subsequent hellhound encounters to the level of your players. If you should elect to use this ring in your own campaign, please feel free to make any homebrew tweaks of your own to the stats and lore behind it. Enjoy!"

An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make a DC 15 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the ooze. Physical Qualities Half-oozes, unsurprisingly, are rather fluid in their characteristics. From a distance, a half-ooze appears the same as a human. Up close, they still look human, but are very obviously something different. Half-oozes wobble slightly, and their skin is prone to rippling when touched. Their skin and hair tones are the same as those of humans, though some might also have a tint of another color depending on their ooze parent. Half-oozes are extremely flexible, but have difficulty bending in ways that would be utterly impossible for a human without something to hold them in position: their natural tendency is to spring back to their human shape. They can, however, hold impossible positions for a few seconds: they can even spread themselves and all they carry into a puddle for a short period of time. Playing a Half-Ooze Half-oozes are usually born humans, and as such their outlook on life can vary wildly. The biggest defining factor in a half-ooze's personality, however, is almost always the way they coped with their transformation. Most are rather amused with fate, but others are horrified or depressed by their new forms. Most half-oozes become adventurers. To a normal human who would likely never go far from the village he was born in, gaining abilities that make them a useful addition to an adventuring party is a mandate to go do just that. To the type of person who would agree to become a half-ooze, this is all the justification one needs. Half-Ooze Characteristics: Open-mindedness, amusement, happiness around wizards Damage Resistances acid Damage Immunities fire Condition Immunities blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, paralysed, petrified, prone Senses blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 8 Amorphous. The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. Innate Spellcasting (1/Day). The ooze can innately cast command (spell save DC 8), requiring no components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. Spider Climb. The ooze can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. ACTIONS Pseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage, plus 4 (1d8) acid damage. Bonus Cantrip When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the acid splash cantrip, which counts as a cleric cantrip for you. Mirewalk Also at 1st level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement if it is caused by mud, marsh, or other semi-solid ground. You have advantage on Strength checks made to escape deep mud, quicksand or from being engulfed by an ooze. Create Green Slime At 6th level, you can use your action to create green slime (DMG p. 105). It covers a 5-foot square patch on an unoccupied floor, wall or ceiling you can see within 30 feet of you. You can create a number of patches equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1). You regain your uses of this feature when you finish a long rest. Divine Strike At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 acid damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the ooze for is physically able to do so. However, you can't use any of your special senses. You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space or merges into your new form. Equipment that merges with the new form has no effect until you leave the form. You can make an attack with a pseudopod. This is a melee weapon attack that deals 2d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and 1d6 acid damage. The ooze form lasts for 1 hour or until you end the effect with a bonus action on your turn. You then revert to your normal form. Amorphous Beginning at 1st Level, the influence of the ooze on your body allows it to morph and flex in ways that are impossible for most. You can move through the space of enemy creatures as difficult terrain. Additionally, you take no penalties when squeezing. Ooze Through Cracks Your form becomes a red goo that can squeeze through the gap under the door, or the cracks between the floorboards. Encounter Star.gif Shadow Minor Action Personal Effect: You gain a +2 power bonus to Stealth checks and may ignore difficult terrain until the end of your next turn. Head Form: Effect: Until the end of your next turn, when you make a squeeze action you enter spaces that are as thin as 1 inch thick. Inhuman Anatomy Beginning at 1st Level, your strange and constantly shifting anatomy causes your internal organs to move around your body, making it difficult for attackers to effectively wound you. When you arent wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Additionally, critical hits against you are less effective. If you would be critically hit, your opponent must make a second attack roll against you. If this second roll would hit, the attack is a critical hit, otherwise it is just a normal hit. Acidic Ooze Beginning at 6th Level, acidic slime oozes out of your pores, physical evidence of the ooze's influence upon you. Any creature that touches you or hits you with a melee attack while within 5 feet of you takes 1d6 acid damage. Opponents grappled by you take this damage at the start of each of their turns. Additionally, as a bonus action, you can leave a trail of ooze that covers any surface you move across during your turn that lasts for two rounds. The trail is considered to be difficult terrain for creatures moving through it. Any creatures that enters the trail for the first time on their turn or begins their turn in it takes 1d6 acid damage. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Sticky Beginning at 14th level, the ooze that leaks from your pores becomes extremely adhesive and sticky. You gain resistance to slashing damage. You also gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. When a creature enters your trail, they must success on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or become restrained. While the trail persists, a creature restrained by the trail can repeat the saving throw at the beginning of each of their turns. On a success, they escape and can move normally. Split At 18th Level, the ooze has so thoroughly become part of you that you can split like one as well. When you are subjected slashing damage, you can use your reaction to instead take no damage if you have at least 2 hit points left. When you do this, a clone of yourself breaks off of your body and enters an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. Both you and your clone have half of your current hit points, hit point maximum, and temporary hit points that you had before you split, rounded down. If your normal hit point maximum changes while you are split, such as from gaining a level, you and your clone's hit point maximums change accordingly. All conditions affecting you before you split now apply to your clone as well. Your clone acts on your initiative and you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. You and your clone share the same spell slots and sorcery points, as well as any other limited resources or features such as Superiority dice or rages. If your clone dies, it disappears and you can't recombine with it, your hit point maximum remaining permanently reduced until restored by greater restoration or similar magic. If you die, your soul moves into your clone. You can merge with your copy as a bonus action when you enter its space or when it enters your space. When you do this, your hit point maximum returns to normal and your current hit points equal the sum of you and your clone's hit points, up to your hit point maximum. Any conditions or effects that applied to you clone now apply to you. If your clone had temporary hit points, you can choose to gain them in place of any you currently have. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Ooze Domain Gods who reside in the Paraelemental Plane of Ooze, or have their origins there, govern slimy creatures, swampy and muddy lands, semi-solids, and all that is amorphous. As many slimes and jellies are corrosive, clerics of this domain also have some power over acids. In the Forgotten Realms setting, Ghaunadaur is the chaotic evil god of abominations, whose symbol is a glowering eye in a purple disc. Before the War of the Spider Queen he resided in the Cauldron of Slime in the Plane of Ooze. During this time, his Domains included Ooze. Summon Ooze (3.5e Spell) Summon Ooze Conjuration (Summoning) Level: Brd 1, Clr 1, Sor/Wiz 1 Components: V, S, F/DF Casting time: 1 round Range: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels) Effect: One summoned creature Duration: 1 round/level (D) Saving Throw: None Spell Resistance: No Ooze Whip (3.5e Spell) Ooze Whip Conjuration Level: Sorcerer/Wizard/Witch 5 Components: S, V Casting time: Immediately Range: 20ft + 5 ft per 2 caster levels Target, Effect, or Area: Target Saving Throw: Reflex negates, Fortitude negates Spell Resistance: Yes Awaken Ooze (5e Spell) Awaken Ooze 8th-level transmutation Casting time: 8 hours Range: Touch Components: V, S, M (a black sapphire worth at least 5,000 gp) Duration: Instantaneous You grant sentience to an ooze. After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller ooze. The target must have an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10, and loses its immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. The awakened ooze is charmed by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the charmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was charmed. Ooze Domain Spells The above table includes only spells published officially. You can substitute any of them for the homebrew spells in the following table. Cleric Level Spells 1 find familiar (slimeball only) 2 Soften Earth and Stone 3 Meld Into Stone 4 Freedom of Movement 5 slimebolt 6 Acid Fog 7 Regenerate 8 Mind Blank 9 conjure elemental (ooze paramental only), flesh to jelly Amulet of Ooze Control (5e Equipment) Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement) While you are attuned to the amulet, ordinary oozes are indifferent towards you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them. The amulet has 3 charges. Whenever an ooze that isn't under another creature's control comes within 30 feet of you, you can expend a charge as an action and make a Charisma check contested by the ooze's Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the ooze behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the amulet's magic for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the ooze is swayed by the amulet's magic and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you maintain concentration, as though you were concentrating on a spell, for a maximum of 1 hour. A friendly ooze obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly ooze, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly ooze starts its turn and is further than 30 feet away from you, your control over that ooze ends, and the ooze behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the amulet's magic for the next 24 hours. The amulet regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. [[3e Summary::This spell summons an ooze. It appears where you designate and acts immediately, on your turn. It attacks everyone to the best of its ability. Remember that oozes are not intelligent; the summoned ooze cannot distinguish between friend or foe. The ooze summoned may have a CR up to 1/2 your caster level. This spell may also be cast using a 3rd level slot; if this option is used, the ooze's CR may be up to your full caster level. A summoned ooze cannot summon or otherwise conjure another creatures, nor can it use any teleportation or planar travel abilities. Oozes cannot be summoned into an environment that cannot support them. When you use a summoning spell to summon a chaotic, evil, good or lawful creature, it is a spell of that type."
344,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] slay spells and shapeshifting,7,5s81h9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5s81h9/5e_slay_spells_and_shapeshifting/,2017-02-06 02:50:28,"In not too long my party will be going up against the BBGG who is a solar, (so not big bad evil guy). Solars have a slaying longbow, which has a chance of killing targets below 100HP (a save or die ability similar to power word kill). Since i have a druid in my party, i've been wondering how to handle his wildshape in regards to this ability. I have looked a bit, not knowing what to search for makes it a bit hard... So any feedback, or RAW in particular, will be very much appreciated. The issue is, that when he is shapeshifted from wildshape (the same issue happens with polymorph, though), he gets a new pool of HP to draw from. Once this is expended, his form reverts to his base form. And as far as i know, his base form can't be healed when he is in wild shape. But that makes me wonder; Which pool should i consider to determine if he is vulnerable to slay abilities. The way i see it, there are a 4 options; Only consider his base form and it's HP pool (it doesn't matter how many HP his shapeshifted form has), only consider his present form and it's HP pool (no matter which it is), add the HP of the forms (so if he has 75HP in base form, he needs to have less than 25HP in shapeshifted form to be vulnerable) or consider both forms, but don't add them (so if he has less than 100HP in either form, he is vulnerable). I personally think, that the second option is best (only consider his current form, ignore all else). the first feels unfair, as he can't be taken out of vulnerability by healing. The 3rd and 4th options just seem overpowered"

348,vulnerability,DnD,My players killed the boss with a castle;or how the deck of many things made the one shot great,18,5m0iba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5m0iba/my_players_killed_the_boss_with_a_castleor_how/,2017-01-05 04:41:14,"So our group wasn't going to do our normal campaigns due to missing people so I volunteered DMing for a one-shot, a first for this group. I decided on level three premade characters and an island escape scenario, I did some drilled down to essentials character sheets[\(as you can see here along with the other materials](URL simplicity, with a 14 year old female Rogue, A Balding Human Monk, A Noble Minotaur Bard and a warforged Cleric. Cleric player was using a speech synthesizer and playing a narcissistic and condescending robot to a T. Rogue player did a great Edgelord 14 year old, Monk player really hated having a bald spot being pointed out(which is ironic given the monk is 7 foot tall)and the Bard player played the cowering wimp the Minotaur was. I wasn't actually expecting four players and had just made four characters for choice but it all worked out great. The concept behind the island is a now-insane demigod kidnapped the four(The White sheets pure souls, the black sheets darkened souls)and put them on an ""abandoned"" island,that once was a Courthouse island/port, just to see how they would work together and try to escape or fail and prove his idea of absolute evil or good right. Really just a nice little sandbox island with multiple potential endings. That's all fine and would of let to a simpler campaign but if you notice on those character sheets I have ""Draw X loot cards"" which I did just to spice it up. I had 10 magic items on sticky notes I was letting people draw randomly from. - Deck of Many Things(Slight curse to appear as normal cards) - Portable Hole - A slightly altered Alchemist Fire(Just to deal damage when it breaks too) - Potion of Last Step(Returns you to your last turn(or 6 seconds prior)) - Goggles of Good Choice(25% of detective/witcher vision) - Hair of the Gorgon(Just a thrown snake with AC reducing poison cause minor Petrification) - Blade of many shapes(+1 blade that can turn into any bladed weapon) - Robe of Useful Objects - Faulty Ring of Telekenisis(20% of not working) - Pot of Stew(Alchemy Jug for Stew/Soup) So with 7 of those given out at the start(and the other 3 during the one shot)I was happy someone, the bard, got the deck of many things and she was super excited to get to use it in DnD. I wasn't really sure how this was going but I was fully prepared for a lot of improv due to deck of many shenanigans. Anyways onto the actual one shot. They all awoke in individual prison cells without remembering how they got there. Nobody but them is around and the door was unlocked so they left, found the guard post and their gear along with a map and a riddle. ""The Light can quench, the Dark can be judged, both can survive by the Knight"" - Signed M. It was intended to be an incredibly vague ""Oh thats what it meant, that makes sense"" kind of riddle as opposed to actually being solvable. Anyways, they leave that area and avoid a Skeleton encounter by not looting dead bodies. They're in a large and once beautiful courthouse and thankfully decided to leave instead of going upstairs(where they could of fought the boss right away)and left the ominous feeling area to explore the Island. Which the *moment* they got outside they wanted to use the Deck of Many things. I used DM Fiat to only let one per person for now and it worked out well. Cleric got a lv4 warforged warrior(who ended up just carrying a mirror for the Cleric later), the Bard got 50k in gems, the Monk got a magic weapon(Cestus with a reaction interrupting jab)and the Rogue got the ""Can reverse one event at any time"" but held onto it. After that they leave for the town on the island. It's abandoned(of course)and all they find is a small malnourished puppy in the pet store and the rogue/monk takes it under their wings. As they're searching the general store the puppy breaks out of the rogues grip(+1 strength v.s -4 yeesh)and runs into an alleyway where it grappled the Rogue as its revealed to be a mimic. They wipe the floor with it of course and find a large key in its belly. With a depressing mimic encounter out of the way they rested and the next day went to the Salamander Cave where they had to fight a giant wooden Salamander statue to enter the cave. Now I goofed up heavily on this part, as I had a carved Salamander I wanted to use as a mini but then didn't realize I gave everyone fire spells/items with it having vulnerability. So they made short work of it and found a healing fountain and the potion of last step in the cave, lore wise you only have to show the salamander you're not weak to pass which is a jerk move to hide a healing fountain behind. Anyways, thats when they decided to draw some more cards. This time only two and what do you know, the Bard got 2 wishes out of it. However before she could utter a wish the rogue player used his prior card to have the wish card never happened. I was actually super happy about that since I had no idea how that'd go with wishes and it was just really funny along with fitting the character well. The bard drew another card like nothing had happened(since it didn't)and got the advice one, with the only advice I gave was ""run away"" which fit multiple encounters left on the island.The rogue then drew a card and got the hate filled enemy one. So 19 days from then some guy who really hates the rogue will just constantly annoy and inconvenience her all day long until one is dead. They left for the nearby crag,saw harpies and left. Nothing really of note there anyways since it was just filler. They went to the Black Sands and found some Black Salt Golems and shipwrecks, also just leaving them be. Onto the shipyards and they find a ship in need of repair but sea-worthy so they'd have to go back to the Sands and salvage to fix it. They decide to do that later and check out the docks, see nothing on it and leave again(which would of triggered a sea serpent battle if they went on it)and slept on the boat. Earlier in the game when they first slept I told them they had horrible nightmares of the island and then on the boat had horrible nightmares of sinking in the sea and the island still. They interpreted that as to finish the island exploring first(with only the main building left)instead of just leaving so went and found a large locked door that the key they found earlier fit and went in to find an even larger edgelord. The demigod gave his little spiel and offered them two choices. Fight him in his room, the court room, or fight him in the sea if they try to flee. So they fought him there and boy did I think that fight was going to be way harder. Granted the extra fighter was useless, he literally hadn't hit a thing since he was summoned, but its a classic bad DM rolls and I loved it. Rogue had a poison ability and did almost half its HP, cleric hit every single scorching ray at 3rd level(with one crit)so that almost brought him down and just to add insult to injury the Bard had cast stinking cloud on this demigod(who was vulnerable to poison)and it failed. So this giant dark angel like demigod of justice is just puking up and down and just getting blasted with everything. He had a legendary action to stop all the white sheets or all the black sheets in place but even with that he missed our monk three times in a row(with a +8 no less)only causing the sun blade to get rid of his comb-over. It came to the bards turn in which even just slapping him with her guitar would of killed him(3 HP left)but instead she chooses to draw a card from the deck of many things in mid-combat. I loved the idea but had no idea if it'd even be combat applicable. Oh it was. Summoning a medium castle within sight range(with up to an hour to choose where)she chose to summon the castle right on top of the boss, which promptly caused a castle to fall down on top of him and now be buried beneath the stairs. They won the day, claimed the island for themselves, killed a boss with a castle(which I figured is 134 D6 damage)when it only had 3 HP left and to add insult to injury turned the bosses layer into the foyer for the castle. All in all it was a very successful one-shot with a few surprise twists but I am so glad I gave them a deck of many things, it would have been fine without it but that made it far far more memorable. Definitely using it again in the future."
349,vulnerability,DnD,My First attempt at a homebrew race - thoughts?,0,5eskpu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5eskpu/my_first_attempt_at_a_homebrew_race_thoughts/,2016-11-25 19:20:29,"Heya! - So this is my first attempt at homebrewing a race for an upcoming campaign. I don't have too much experience in the fine-tuning of races so it'd be great to hear your thoughts on how to improve it. EDIT: This is or 5e btw **Damned** &gt;*The battle was almost lost - as the enemy stormed forward they prepared for a brutal defeat. However, in the distance among the bodies of their lost allies, life stirred anew. The beast that came from tore through the bodies and stricken down upon the enemy leader, crushing the skull with a single strike of the sword. The tirade continued - as the creature broke the bones of men a thousand warriors failed to defeat, without thought, and without mercy.* *- The Archives of Old Volume XVII; Demonic Lore* Creatures born of malice and hatred, the Damned are a demonic race that scatter old battlegrounds across the land. Damned are a race that finds itself most at home when raiding towns and challenging monsters; blood and gore are the signs of a Damned. Though some Damned are conceived through a parent channeling their rage most spawn from fallen soldiers, coming from the ether to turn their rage into a physical form - often in large numbers. To side with a Damned is to find one with a dedicated killer, and to look into their eyes is to look into rage, unkempt and pure. --------------------------------------------------------------------- **Rotten and Empty** Despite being formed from an emotion - and thus effectively spawning from the ether - the Damned's form has decayed, become skeletal. Standing at 7 feet tall they rise above many races and tower above the smaller species - regardless of what beast it spawned from. A human skeleton, it's features are almost caricatured with distended limbs and jawless skulls all with fleshy tubes intertwined within. Weighing a frail 60lbs the Damned are dexterous - being able to stand atop things no other race their size should be. Their skulls are empty, their minds ethereal, and nothing comes from within but an empty blackness. This empty appearance extends to their attire, rarely donning apparel at all and then only to wear armor - in this life they show no emotion in their bone-faces, only through expression and voice can one tell where they stand. -------------------------------------------------------------- **A Warrior's Wrath** Spawning from the emotions of a fallen warrior it's only natural that the Damned are imbued with the vigor and love for a battle. Unwavered in the midst of blood and gore they have a natural taking to any battle they find themselves in and find allies best when fighting alongside them. Conversely they find themselves at odds when in peaceful situations, becoming aggressive quickly and often boring of what to them seems like a tiresome situation without the feel of blood on their hands. -------------------------------------------------------------- **Rage of The Ether** Appropriately for such a race the Damned are creatures quick to anger and quicker to violence - additionally as beasts of anger the Damned turn the will of their ethereal form into skills of the physical nature. From this will a Damned is able to make great use out of the simplest of weaponry to gain the upper hand in combat - be it their will. Similarly the Damned have a will that's strong or mindless - depending on who sees a Damned endlessly push towards completing his task. From this the Damned make great allies - working for a goal with amazing will. -------------------------------------------------------------- **Damned Names** Damned names are atypical, rarely following a family or clan name and instead picking variable names - with only a small basis in that of the names around them. The Damned has two names, one spoken in harsh, piercing syllables and the other is odd - often based upon a weapon or war. **Damned Common Names** Katchin, Torddis, Takktin, Otich, Karpit, Tichkkin, Karthicc, Kyippich, Itkkip, Quepicc, Koppitch, Tittich, Quippik, Kippitch, Koitticc, Chippick, Teitit, Ochick, Kikaik, Kinkki, Tityk, Itchink, Kyoutich, Tikip, Quikit **Damned Last Names** Daeger, Boren, Machial, Soard, Foargen, Corous, Feilden, Oupei, Duraugo, Normaind, Bou, Wrend -------------------------------------------------------------- **Damned Traits** The Damned spawn with various natural traits - stemming from their roots within the ether, and as beasts of the battlefield. **Ability Score Increase:** Choose either Dexterity or Strength have that ability increase by two. **Languages:** You can speak Common and Infernal. **Age:** Damned mature at the same rate as humans and, effectively immortal, are able to live forever under the right circumstances - however as their hunger for the battle fades they often appear to age, growing tired and weary as the emotions which they used to spawn die off. **Alignment:** Due to the raw nature of their emotions and strong will towards what they want most Damned are chaotic nature. Coming from the battlefield they tend towards good or evil dependant on the warrior they spawned from - they're very rarely neutral. **Size:** Damned stem from around 6-8ft tall, leaning on 7ft, and can weigh around 60lbs. Your size is medium. Speed: Your speed is 20ft - from the will of the Damned your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor. **Superior Darkvision:** Thanks to your ethereal origins you're naturally adept to live in the pitch black conditions of the ether. Your darkvision range is 120 feet. **Crooked Resistance:** Your skeletal form provides a resistance against piercing and poison damage. **Fault of the Ether:** You have a vulnerability against bludgeoning damage and a disadvantage on all acrobatics-related checks. **Frail State:** Your max hit points are reduced by two - your hit point gain from leveling up is also reduced by one before being applied. **Unrivaled Rage:** When under %25 health you add 1D6 damage after checking to see if you hit. **Channeled Fury:** You can have an advantage to any attack the number of times equivalent of your proficiency bonus x 2 - you must go through a long rest to regain these rolls. **Weak:** Your carrying capacity is reduced by 25%. **Infernal Skills:** You're proficient in Intimidation. **Damned Proficiencies:** You're proficient two of the following:Simple Mele/Martial Melee Simple Ranged/Martial Ranged weapons. EDIT: Made the abilities not terribly OP, thanks everybody!"
350,vulnerability,DnD,Warlock hunter item,2,5glonm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5glonm/warlock_hunter_item/,2016-12-05 23:37:48,"So one of my PCs is a female tiefling bladelock , level 5. Keeping up the stereotypes. But after a couple of years of being bound to a fiend she has realized it ain't so cool as she thought in her teens. So she is going to try to keep her powers while not paying the fiend of suffering her soul. One of the things you guys suggested in my [contract post](URL gave me an idea. The fiend that she made a deal with wants to climb the hellish social steps for more power, this is one of the reasons he deals with mortals to get more souls and more power; a common tactics among fiends is having warlocks do stuff in the material plane that somehow improve their standing in hell. Usually sacrifices and such, but maybe the fiend might suggest that the warlock goes on a hunt. If she goes around hunting other warlock s of other fiends and successfully trapping their souls then the fiends that dealt with them gave power for free and got no soul in return, besides loosing a minion in the material plane. That might get the warlock fiendish enemies but that is a problem for her and in the future, need to know basis. So the fiend wants his warlock hunting bladelock to be able to find the prey so he gives her a list with names and a spherical compass guiding her to the next target, maybe the compass is what traps their soul. And he wants her able to kill them so he gives her additional powers. This is where my item idea comes in. A small case or coffer with a set of syringes, vials and things like that, all with different contents. The warlock gets to choose some of this syringes, 3 for now. And she gets a small coffer box-thingy to hold them all while travelling. Depending on which she chooses they give her different powers and bonuses. Some I had in mind were: * A syringe with a bronze and metallic looking liquid moving inside it, there is a label that says ""Inject Me"". when injected your skin color changes to a more orange and metallic tone. Whenever you suffer damage in the next 3 days you get resistance to all physical damage (slashing, piercing and bludgeoning) and +2 AC since you are made of metal, but you have disadvantage on saving throws (or the attacker advantage) on lightning themed spells. Your skins turns to bronze and you are more resistant while still able to move as much as before. The syringe reappears full every 2 days. * A different small bottle has a piece of wax over the top is filled with a weird floaty and vapor like black substance inside, there is a label that says ""Breath Me"". When the wax is broken the top of the glass bottle has small holes where air can pass through. Whenever breathed in the PC gets advantage to stealth and can cast ""Gaseous Form"" twice while in this state also you get +1 AC since you are harder to see and define your borders. While in this state you have sunlight sensitivity and vulnerability to radiant damage. It lasts for 12 hours and reappears full and waxed every night. * A vial filled with a red and orange liquid sloshes inside it moving slow more jello than water, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drank this liquid turns you into a [hulking demon](URL Clothes and item fuse into your form. Your size is large, your AC 14 (natural armor), your STR-18 DEX-15 Con-14, you have multi-attack and make two claw attacks(+7 to hit 2d6+4 each). You have resistance to fire damage and a speed of 30 ft. on land and climbing. But vulnerability from radiant damage and you are technically a fiend to spell effects, you are unable to cast spells that require precise movement of your hands (I believe that was somatic) in this form. This form lasts for 1 hour and the vial reappears every 3 days. * A vial in the shape of a fish with a transparent liquid inside, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drank you gain gills and a swim speed of 60 ft. You have advantage against bloodied (D&amp;D 4e) enemies in the water and can summon a reef shark under your control, however in this form you cannot pass more than 20 minutes out off the water. It last for 4 hours and reappears every morning with the high tide. * A small jar in the shape of a brain is filled with small pieces of something meaty, there is a label that says ""Eat Me"". When eaten you feel how part of your lips stretch and you start to understand more things. Your intelligence increases by +2, now can cast two of these spells (with Int as the spellcasting ability): Command, Dissonant Whispers, Blur, Crown of Madness and Hypnotic Pattern. (These were chosen because they are all mind altering spells, but they all do different things so it may be interesting for a player to choose.). While in this state you have sunlight sensitivity and vulnerability to psychic damage since you are now very sensitive to brain altering shit. In this form you have 4 small tentacles around your mouth. This lasts for 2 hours and reappears every 3 days. * A vial shaped like a woman with bat wings enveloping her filled with a reddish liquid, there is a label that says ""Drink Me"". When drank you sprout leathery red bat wings and gain fly 60 ft. Your charisma increases by 2 and you gain the abilities to Charm (like a succubus) and do a Draining kiss that (after a Con Check) does 3d10+Cha Mod psychic damage. However you also gain vulnerability to radiant damage and you are technically a fiend to spell effects . This form lasts for 30 minutes and the vial reappears every 2 days. My idea is that as she grows in power the fiend offers more vials to hunt more powerful warlocks of other fiends. These are some that I had in mind. Are they broken? Are they too weak? Am I an idiot? Any other cool ideas I could put in? We play 5e by the way"
351,vulnerability,DnD,Spell Clarification: The Utility of Astral Projection,6,5iih1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5iih1c/spell_clarification_the_utility_of_astral/,2016-12-16 03:34:44,"While discussing D&amp;D 5e, a friend asked me what the purpose of Astral Projection was. I told them that it was used to explore the outer planes, but that it was dangerous due the vulnerability of the silver cord. They asked why you wouldn't simply use Gate or Plane Shift, and I didn't have an answer. I've looked through the spell and its competitors, and, quite frankly, its 5e variation just doesn't seem to hold up. I've tried to put together what I've been able to find on the subject and to address some points that may come up. If any of you could take the time to read through them and answer my questions, I'd be very thankful. First, let's talk about the spell's previous utility. In 3.5, Astral Projection had the benefit of exploring the planes while A: your physical form was in a state of suspended animation, thus allowing you to search the cosmos for otherworldly knowledge and experiences without burning through your likely mortal lifespan, and B: because you're merely projecting yourself, you're not in immediate danger. Being reduced to 0 hit points simply ends the spell and returns you to your body on the Material Plane. You were still putting yourself at risk in the Astral Plane where the Githyanki and their silver swords roam, but, once out of the Astral Plane and exploring the Outer Planes, you were safer in almost any given situation than you would be if you were there in the flesh. The trade off was a little bit of initial risk for overall safety. In 5e, however, there's some conflicting statements, or at the very least some poor wording. According to the spell description in the 5e Player's Handbook, once you enter a plane other than the Astral Plane as an Astral Projection, your body and items are then transported to that plane. Now, the spell in 3.5 edition did specify a similar effect where a second body with your possessions would be created for you upon entering another plane, but it still provided the benefit of the Astral Form in that, if you were to die in this second body, you'd still wake up in your original body on the Material Plane, safe and sound, not a moment older for the journey. The fifth edition version of the spell, however, seems to imply you just end up on the other plane, same as you would if you'd used Gate or Planar Shift, without any of the added protection of the spell's 3.5 counterpart. With this in mind, the only thing Astral Projection allows you to explore is the Astral Plane, an endless, primarily empty expanse full of bandits and storms meant only to act as an in between for the other planes. Not exactly the treasure trove of information or extraplanar intrigue compared to most any of the outer planes. Strangely enough, the DMG's entry about Astral Projection talks about it as though it functions like its 3.5 counterpart, stating that someone using Astral Projection is none worse for wear when reduced to 0 hit points on either the Astral Plane or the Outer Planes. If this indeed how it works, then I'd be happy to say conflict resolved. I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't like to see that kind of clarification in the spell's PHB description or some errata rather than having to look through the DMG, but a ruling is a ruling. Assuming this isn't the case, however, I really can't find much of a niche for Astral Projection. There is a case to be made that Astral Projection provides freedom rather than protection when compared to Plane Shift or Gate. The availability of forks properly tuned to specific planes for Plane Shift's material component could be limited, and Gate specifies a deity can shut it down to prevent travelers to their ""domain"", which could extend to an entire plane. Astral Projection, on the other hand, just requires an expensive yet nonmagical gem and bar of silver, so, arguably, what Astral Projection lacks in safety and convenience, it makes up for in freedom and accessibility. This argument is flimsy, however, given that it's reasonable a deity could shut down any travel to their plane if they so desired, and that there's nothing encouraging GMs to be stingy with Plane Shift's component availability. Additionally, there's the important note that, if the GM is willing to break out deities and component scarcity to shut down Plane Shift and Gate, then they probably don't want the player hopping planes in the first place, meaning any spell to that effect is doomed. In short, it seems like all Astral Projection has going for it is some interesting flavor text at the expense of some very pricey, consumed components, and the risk of an instadeath in the face of bad weather, while its competition and alternatives claim blatant utility superiority at generally lower costs. Is there something I'm not seeing? An errata or Sage Advice I glossed over? If I am missing something, be it official answers or personal interpretation, I'd appreciate whatever insight you could provide. Thank you. PS: I'm also wondering as to whether there are any ways to minimize the dangers of Astral Projection. Currently the only thing that comes to mind is to beat oneself to within an inch of your life, then put a Contingency spell on yourself to reduce you to 0 hit points on the trigger that your cord is about to be severed, though that's not entirely solid."

354,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Homebrew Sorcerer Subclass (Final Rough Draft) - Sanguineous Anomaly,0,5cr1zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5cr1zk/5e_homebrew_sorcerer_subclass_final_rough_draft/,2016-11-14 04:50:01,"**Sanguineous Anomaly** Your innate magic comes from the immense amounts of untapped magic that flows within all blood. The abilities that you have been born with are some of the rarest among all sorcerers, and as such, no one knows truly why you were given these gifts. Most people like you start off being able to use their talents, but there have been a few recorded cases of late-blooming. Either way, the abilities that you have been brought into this world with have already caused you to be labeled and stereotyped, for better, or for worse. **Bloodstones** Most sorcerer-anomalies do not have enough blood inside of them to keep their powers up for very long. Therefore, a method of storage for blood has been developed using valuable gemstones. At level 1, you can enchant a crystalline gemstone to be able to store blood (HP). Bloodstones store blood in the form of sorcery points. Whenever you wear the bloodstone on your persons, you lose the ability to use your own sorcery points. In return, you can use the bloodstones sorcery points as your own. When you channel HP into the bloodstone, it converts HP into sorcery points at the ratio described in Blood Casting. If the remaining HP can be rounded up, do so into a sorcery point. It takes 24 hours of full concentration (breaks can be taken) to create a bloodstone from a gem worth 5000. The total capacity of a gemstone is 1 sorcery point per 250gp of worth. The minimum amount of sorcery points the bloodstone will have is equal to your maximum number of sorcery points without bloodstones. To increase the actual capacity of your bloodstone, take your current maximum number of sorcery points and roll that many d6s (or your current hit die). Then divide that number by your maximum hit die roll (6) and round the remainder (round up if the remainder is half of your maximum hit die roll). This is the number of sorcery points you add on to the bloodstones minimum capacity, creating the new maximum capacity. This number cannot go above the gems total capacity. You may always try to re-enchant a bloodstone, but you must accept the new maximum. When you enchant a different gem using this process, your previous bloodstone loses all magical effects. If you are a DM and want to prank your party member, dont show them this next portion. If you try to enchant a gem with a lower capacity than your current sorcery point maximum, the gem will explode into shrapnel. Also if you happen to forget to transfer the blood from your previous bloodstone after you finish the new one, the blood left in the old gem will immediately burst out and spatter everything in range. The damage to the gem and the amount of blood spatter depends on how much blood was left in the gem and the quality of said gem. **Blood Alchemy** At 1st level, you gain the ability to use your own blood for magic. You can use your main action to gain sorcery points using your own HP at the rate of 1d6 HP per sorcery point, or you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain 1d6 HP. You also the effect below. -- **Blood Casting** You lose the ability to use Flexible Casting, but in return, you can use sorcery points to cast spells instead of using a spell slot. This still uses the spell creation table. **Blood Magic** At 3rd level, instead of Metamagic, you gain the ability to twist your blood to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Blood Magic options of your choice. You gain one more at the 10th and 17th level. You can only have one Blood Magic option active at a time. -- **Frenzy** For 2 sorcery points, you can use your main action to make 2 melee attacks. -- **Coagulate** For 2 sorcery points, you can use this effect on your reaction. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +4 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack. -- **Platelets** For 4 sorcery points, your AC cannot drop below 16, regardless of what armor you are wearing. This lasts for one hour. -- **Congeal** You may use sorcery points to make weapons from blood. Free-handed (e.g. claws) or small one-handed weapons (e.g. daggers) cost 1 sorcery point each. Medium one-handed weapons (e.g. longswords) cost 2 sorcery points each. Shields cost 3 sorcery points, and two-handed weapons and great-shields cost 4 sorcery points. You may use other Blood Magic options at the same time as this one. Weapons made from this effect are treated as iron, and revert to blood when you deactivate this effect. -- **Focus** For every 2 sorcery points, the next spell you cast gains 1 spell save DC. -- **Burst** For 1 sorcery point, you can double movement speed and your jump distance. -- **Interference** For 4 sorcery points, you may use your reaction to gain resistance to a spell type until your next turn. -- **Transfusion** You may heal a creature within touching distance of you for 1d6 HP per sorcery point, up to 3. **Bloodlust** Starting at 6th level, you can regain HP based on how much damage to deal to enemies. As long as you are 5 feet away from the target, you gain half of all piercing and slashing damage you deal on that target as HP. On a lethal strike, you gain all of the HP the enemy had left, and do not halve it. In addition, choose one of the effects below. You gain the other effect at level 14. -- **Vampirism** If there is a non-undead corpse that has not been dead for more than 8 hours within distance and sight, you can drain HP from them up to the HP capacity they had while living. You may only regain half your maximum HP through this method, the rest must be used for your bloodstone. You may drain any number of bodies within 30 feet of you at the same time, but it takes 5 minutes per body to completely drain their blood. You may also take blood from a living victim as long as they have an open wound, and only up to your maximum HP. -- **Boiling Blood** You gain the ability to speed up your blood flow at will, amplifying the power of your muscles and your brains processing speed to superhuman levels. For 1/5 of your maximum HP, as your main action you may gain the effects of Haste for 5 minutes, but also gain a vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage. You do not need a focus or material components to gain this effect, as you are not casting a spell. When these effects end, you gain the effects of Slow for 5 minutes. If you are outside of combat and stationary, this time reduces to 1 minute. You must complete a long rest before you can use this again. This shortens to a short rest once you reach level 20. (Bleeding and double damage from melee attacks. Also two unarmed attacks for a sorcery point.) **Iron Maiden** You have mastered the art of using blood magic. Starting at the 18th level, trading HP and sorcery points is now a free action. You may also use your bonus action to use Blood Magic rather than a full action. ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Thank you for reading!

Less demons, more fey. I've also based my magic system on information from an historical understanding on magic. As such I'd like to give all fey creatures a weakness to cold forged iron, or generally iron and steel as is common in scandinavian folklore. I'm thinking vulnerability, but I'm having problems balancing it out. Maybe giving all faerie creatures a base resistance to magic, or advantage on saving throws against it as a counter, but it hardly feels like it makes up for the disadvantage. Anyone doing something similiar or have any suggestions?"
356,vulnerability,DnD,"Character who fancies himself an engineer, looking for input",2,5dikkg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/5dikkg/character_who_fancies_himself_an_engineer_looking/,2016-11-18 08:47:18,"I'm working on a scientist/wizard type character in 5e and as the title says I'd like some input. The character enjoys the unorthodox and likes looking for ways to ""improve"" things. He's a Human Variant with the Skilled feat, which I'm using to take proficiency with Tinker's and Smith's tools (I'm open to suggestions for the third proficiency, otherwise I'm just taking Stealth). Class is Wizard of the Necromancer variety; there's a lot of fun to be had with undead minions for someone who feels a constant need to ""improve"" faulty designs. So for actual inventions I was thinking of buying a pen &amp; paper in-game and spending my short &amp; long rests coming up with schematics, with skill checks to make progress. More complicated schematics have higher roll requirements and need more successes, and when the schematic is complete I'll need it on-hand along with the appropriate tools and materials to actually get down and make the invention. As an extra requirement I'd like to have to justify *why* my character wants to build any particular invention. Inspiration doesn't come out of nowhere, and having to be able to explain why I want to make something in-character ought to help me keep my inventions appropriate to the DM's universe; it's all well and good saying I want to invent the gun, but if gunpowder hasn't even been discovered yet then where did my character draw inspiration from and how does he intend for it to work? So for example, I might decide that it's high time I invent the horseless carriage. Inspiration is simple enough; horses are a vulnerability and removing them without sacrificing too much mobility would make carriages safer and more efficient. Now, how do I want my carriage to move? Maybe I can have a number of undead in specialised compartments individually turning the wheels via some kind of crank. It'd be slower than a conventional carriage, but since they don't need food and won't suffer from exhaustion they'll be perfect for long distance travel. That's a simple enough design, so the schematic won't be very difficult to come up with - maybe requiring a small handful of DC15 checks. But what if I wanted a carriage that could drive itself? This'll probably be the most advanced piece of technology I'll aim for if the DM allows it; the invention of the steam engine. The really hard part will be finding a way for my character to discover that steam power is possible, but after that I imagine it'd take a solid number of DC25-30 checks while working on a physical prototype to get one that works. The aim is to have a smallish number of cool gadgets and some knick knacks by mid-late game which my character can take pride in. So what do you think? Is this all too much? Should anything be tweaked in the name of balance or fairness? And what kind of inventions could you suggest? Preferably nothing more powerful/useful than a cantrip, unless it's something super cool that a reasonable DM would consider allowing"

He's going to have a red dragon simulacrum'd to protect his vault. Since creatures created by simulacrum are made of snow, I was considering playing with fire resistances for those creatures. A creature that would normally have immunity would have resistance, resistance would have no resistance, and no resistance would have vulnerability. Maybe I could also throw in resistance to cold damage? The spell itself mentions nothing of the sort, but to me, it just makes sense. I figure it'd be a slight curveball to throw at veteran players, who would normally use frost attacks on a fire dragon to find that it has less of an affect, and that their fire attacks do something instead of nothing. Thoughts? How would/do you rule on simulacrum creatures?"

AL legal character creation and all that non-sense. What would you make? --- I'd make a Half-Orc OoV Paladin, Human Sorcerer(3)/Warlock(9), Human Rogue, and Human OoA Paladin. OoV Paladin takes a Mace of Disruption, Dueling Fighting Style and a shield. Sorc-Lock takes a Rod of the Pack Keeper +2 Rogue takes Sword of Short Sword +2 and a normal Short Sword. OoA Paladin takes Armor of Vulnerability (Resistance to Slashing), Dueling Fighting Style and a sword. The Sorc-Lock needs to hit the Balor with a Heightened Hold Monster, Spell Save 19 and the Balor rolls at disadvantage, negating the advantage from Magic Resistance. The Balor has to roll a 15+, which only has a 30% chance of success. If this fails, the party waits a round, and the Sorc-Lock needs to use his Bonus Action to burn a 2nd level sorc spell slot for 3 more Sorc Points and try again. The Balor hitting a 15+ twice is a row is only a 9% chance. The OoA Paladin tanks moves in and Divine Smites the ever living crap of the Balor. Using two 2nd-Level Divine Smites and having Resistance to the Fire Aura due to Eldritch Ward from OoA. Both attacks are auto-crits while the Balor is paralyzed. Next the OoV Paladin moves in, Bonus Action to Hunter's Mark (from OoV) and use two 2nd-Level Divine Smite auto-crits on the still paralyzed Balor. The rogue follows suit, critting the poor Balor for days. The SorcLock has 3 Sorc Points, two 2nd-Level Spell Slots, and four 1st-Level Spell slots and 2 Pact Magic Slots of 5th-Level. This means we can Heighten Hold Monster twice. Assuming the Balor fails both Hold Monster saves and we have two turns of auto-crits, we get the following: &gt; OoA Paladin: 2 Attacks x 1/2 Resistance from non-magical = 1x2d8+7 = Avg: 15. 2 Divine Smitesx4d8 Radiant Damage + 2x1d8 Improved Divine Smite=10d8=Ave: 40. Total: 55 Damage. &gt; OoV Paladin: 2 Attacks x1 Magical Weapon to ignore Resistance=2x2d8+7 + 2x1d8(Racial)=4d8+7+7=Avg: 30. 2 Divine Smitesx4d8 Radiant Damage + 2x1d8 Improved Divine Smite=10d8=Ave: 40. Total: 70. &gt; Rogue (Duel Wielding): 2d6+7 (+2 Sword Attack) +2d6x0.5 (Normal sword, against resistance) +12d6 (Crit Sneak Attack) =15d6+7=52. Total Damage: 55+70+52=177 Damage per round the Balor is Paralyzed. If Paralyzed for 2 Rounds, from two castings of the spell, 354 Damage. Aside from Fire Aura and Death Throes, with initiative stacked in our favor, we don't take a single hit. Can you think of a way to kill it that doesn't rely on it failing a Wisdom Save and being chain-Paralyzed? Edit: I used * for multiple forgetting that its an formatting thing.

These are taken specifically from the [list of races](URL that do not have an improving, reviewing, or removing template present. These are showcased by the website as as completed races. Contents: - Introduction - Background - Cyclops - Gargoyle - Kenku - Revenant - Satyr - More Races # Background DanDWiki is well known for being high up in the google rankings despite prominently featuring untested homebrew content that, in the eyes of new players, is otherwise indistinguishable from official content. It is swamped with un-curated, untested, unbalanced homebrew. &gt; You think it's un-curated now? You see the good 70% of content that doesn't get through and see what eldritch horrors can arise from some people's contributions. -- [sgtlion, DanDWiki Admin]( URL So what can we do about this? Its up to DanDWiki to update their site to clearly distinguish between SRD and Homebrew content, but as a community we can at least set a precedent for evaluating the balance of homebrew monsters. As of last week, /u/sgtlion mentioned that DanDWiki was revamping its racial design guide. I view that as a small victory. Together, we can all make a difference. On the subject of evaluating races, I personally use the Musicus scale as a first look, which I then use as a basis to examine the race in more depth. A musicus score that hovers around 5-6 is the sweet spot, and lower is preferred to higher. However, a sweet spot score doesnt necessarily mean a well-balanced homebrew, and a high score doesnt necessarily mean its overpowered. You gotta use your own judgement  but its a pretty damn good indication of what to expect. These little review posts are mainly entertainment, but I'd also like to see more people get involved and start a larger discussion about the creation and design of homebrew material. Lets begin. # Cyclops URL #### Musicus Score - Base: **8.5** - Poseidon: **Breaks the scale.** - Gaia: **Breaks the scale.** - Zeus: **3** - Chronos: **3** Youre either sitting at an **11.5** or youre so inordinately powerful that you are a legitimate threat to the entire world. #### The Good - I like how Paul is a perfectly legitimate name. - The flavour isnt filled with typos. #### The Bad - I cant stand large-sized homebrew races because Ive never seen one that does a decent job of it. - Being Large sized, they get a whole load of extra bonuses. Im counting this as a +2 on the scale (generously low), which would mean its about on par with the gnomes advantage on all int/wis/cha saving throws versus magic. Id rather be an enormous creature than a gnome so I think thats fair. - They also get +2 for the 15+Dex (max 17) unarmored AC. The Musicus score grants +2 for just 13+Dex so I think thats also pretty fair. - The Poseidon subrace was already pretty bad with its massive swim speed and automatic health when in water, but starting at level 10 you gain the ability to cast a 9th level spell and all you have to do is succeed on a DC 20 charisma check. Literally thats it. No other limitations. Not even a limit on how many times you can do it. Thats all. DC 20 Charisma check and you can keep making that check all day. Holy fuck. ***Holy fuck.*** - When the Gaia subrace is ... god help me  ***standing on the ground***  they regain 1 hit point at the start of their turn. That might not sound like much until you remember that, by ***standing on the ground***, they can eventually regain all of their hit points at no cost. This would take like 5 minutes, tops. *Mother of god.* - The two most powerful gods have cyclopses that are actually the most reasonably powered compared to the others. And yet those two subraces *still* have a tonne of problems. Im not going to go into it. This race is giving me a headache. - All of the abilities are worded really really really poorly. You gain regeneration 1 is not how you give someone regeneration. If you are stood in or swimming in deep water is a mess. Adding (you can only summon horses and hippocampi) is not how you impose that kind of limitation on a spell. Pretty much every ability has poor and casual wording. My headache grows with every syllable. #### The Verdict: CTRL+A DEL #### Implementation If you want to play a giant, play goliath. Pluck out one eye if you want to be a cyclops. Done. Well this was a great start to part 3!  I say, sarcastically. Lets check out these gargoyles. Maybe theyll be better. # Gargoyle URL #### Musicus Score - Base: **4.5** - Amber: **1.5** - Granite: **2** - Obsidian: **3** - Opal: **3** **6** - **7.5** The subraces are poorly balanced with one another. #### The Good - I like that your language is Terran. - The flavour is nice. Theres something pleasing about well-constructed sentence structure. #### The Bad - You have to give examples of names. - It is evident that the creator realized that the gargoyles abilities would be quite powerful, and as a result you only get +1 to 2 ability scores rather than the standard of +2 to one score and +1 to another. I see this a lot. As is standard, it does little to help the race, which has problems that cant be solved by reducing their base stats a little bit. - It seems evident to me that someone wrote the flavour and someone else entirely wrote the ability descriptions. While the flavour approaches a modicum of eloquence, the abilities are plagued by lovecraftian abominations such as: Gargoyles subraces are generally defined by what they are made of there are four common types. - I dont like a tonne of subraces. One thing often not considered when evaluating balance is that having a tonne of choice is in itself a major advantage. - The subraces are poorly balanced with one another. The Amber race halves damage against critical hits, which is fairly situational and not actually all that strong (and also it should do what Adamantine armor does because otherwise it interacts really strangely with damage), whereas the obsidian and opal races get innate spellcasting. Need I say more. - I have a few issues even with the relatively weak Amber subrace. Theres already a way to counteract critical hits, which is Adamantine armor. Adamantine is purportedly the strongest natural substance in the Forgotten Realms if I remember my lore correctly. Ambers claim to fame is that its goopy and traps insects. Its not known for being almost supernaturally strong. The creator attempted to explain this by saying that the gargoyles have weathered thousands of storms and their joints have hardened as a result, but  in the Age section it mentions that weathering thousands of storms is pretty much *the only way to reduce a gargoyles lifespan.* So which is it? Does weathering degrade or strengthen the gargoyle? It cant be both. - Adding wisdom modifier to initiative rolls is almost certainly a bad idea. - Fly speed is dangerous, even at only 30 feet, because it makes the DMs job of planning encounters a lot more difficult. #### The Verdict It needs too much work to become a usable race. Last week I talked about how the best design for a homebrew race is capturing the essence of the race in as few abilities as possible. I truly believe that the gargoyle fails to do this on a fundamental level, almost purely because of the strange grouping of subraces. #### Implementation There isnt an existing race that is an easy parallel to the gargoyle. Maybe the Warforged? If a player was deadset on a gargoyle, the changes Id make would be to remove the subraces and the flying speed and give them a full ASI. This would change the score to 5.5, and Id be happy to see where we go from there. # Kenku URL #### Musicus Score - Base: **3.5** - Blessed: **2** (the holy preservation trait contributes nothing. IMO traits should be effective when youre alive or theyre not effective at all) - Wretched: **2.5** **5.5 - 6** #### The Good - I like the quote. Its pretty creepy. - I like that their guilds are called flocks. - There is an admirable restraint to the amount of abilities granted. The musicus score is right in the sweet spot. - I love the mimicry ability. Its fun, and its also very well written and thought out. - I like that they dont have a fly speed. - I like that you can only speak through mimicry. #### The Bad - If there ever was an example of a race that didnt need subraces, this is it right here. Having a devil/angel theme for a race of copycat bird people makes no sense at all. - I dont know any player who would be attracted to the kenku race, known for being thieves and scoundrels, and then take the Blessed subrace instead of the subrace that makes them better at being thieves and scoundrels and is also more powerful in general. - Even though the mimicry ability is well considered, on a practical level it would be a bit of a pain as a DM to have to constantly roll insight and investigation checks. - The mimicry ability relies on having a decent DC, which is based on your Charisma. While the mimicry is a base trait, you can only get a Charisma bonus by taking the Wretched subrace. Again, there seems to be no reason to take Blessed instead. - Ambusher synergises way too well with rogue. Although  on second thought  the rogue would almost certainly have advantage in the surprise round anyway because they gain surprise by hiding, which also gives them advantage, and they only get one attack per turn, so they cant really scrape too much from that ability. It would synergise best with a class that can hide well and then immediately make several attacks against multiple targets. So  it works best with a ranger or a dex fighter. On second thought Ambusher isnt too bad of a trait. - It takes a special kind of player to play a kenku. Specifically, one who is naturally good at mimicking people, because thats the only way this race can talk. #### The Verdict I think the race is relatively decent as homebrew goes. Its restrained, and its abilities are fairly focused on representing the kenku as a race as accurately as possible in as few abilities as possible. However, it split the party in a sense with its subraces. #### Implementation Get rid of the Blessed subrace altogether and make the Wretched abilities part of the main race. Speak with the DM about how to implement the mimicry trait in social situations. Its not actually the worst option out there and in the right hands it could be a lot of fun. # Revenant URL #### Musicus Score **5** This assumes that you get a +3 total ability score increase from the body you inhabit. It also discounts the vulnerability of being an undead creature as well as living, which actually might have an effect. #### The Good - The Revenant is one of my favourite MM monsters and Im sure theres a good way to implement it somehow. Having such a short time period to complete a goal is a great way to bring in a sense of urgency and ~~agency~~ conflict to the roleplaying. We cant spend six months running a brothel in Waterdeep because we have to track down the treacherous dragon queen, who just happens to be in exactly this direction in exactly this distance, *come on guys lets go lets go!* - I think this is actually a really unique way to tackle a revenant race, and in some cases its actually pretty well thought out. - I like that you are considered both an undead and living creature (I assume this means humanoid/undead in terms of type, which is the best possible interpretation of this trait). This is an elegant way of adding in the implications of being an undead race without making them inadvertently immune to many spells and effects. - Only gaining the ability scores of the corpse you inhabit, rather than every single racial trait, is a really good idea. #### The Bad - It is an admirable effort but it is plagued with small details that dour the whole thing. The most obvious one is -- how do you possess a corpse? Specifically, what actions would you need to take in order to make that happen? It is not specified. - Adversary differs from the revenants traits in the MM in ways that are a little bit strange to me. The ability is laid out very plainly but instead the creator chose to rewrite it to make it more ambiguous and much more difficult to actually implement in the game. For example, apparently you transform into a soul version of yourself, but this is never explained in more detail. - Filled with typos. Spaces are sometimes absent between words. The wording as a whole is ambiguous and sometimes opaque. - against such thing effects - The Mortal Form trait indicates that you only inherit the ability scores of the corpse you inhabit, but elsewhere it is implied that you also inherit the alignment, size, and speed. Size I can understand. Alignment? That would be really weird. Speed? Its always better for a revenant to possess the corpse of a wood elf, and they have a disincentive to possess the corpses of halflings and gnomes. I think thats a poor design choice. They should have a constant speed, probably 25 ft., instead, otherwise well see a hundred revenant elves and zero revenant halflings simply because speed is actually pretty important for a monster whos gotta work under a constant time limit. - Not needing sleep is pretty powerful, practically speaking. You still need to take a long rest but you can just stay up all night keeping watch over the others in your party. #### The Verdict The ideas are great. Everything else, not so much. #### Implementation Theres already a revenant in the Curse of Strahd UA stuff, although from what Ive heard its not very good. Im not sure how Id personally deal with a player who wanted nothing more than to be an unstoppable unkillable undead force of hatred and revenge, but most likely Id get them to not do that. Barring that, however, this wouldnt be the worst option if I was able to spend some time clarifying some of the sticking points and making sure its abilities are more clear. # Satyr URL #### Musicus Score **10** Too god damn much. #### The Good - The picture they chose is really nice. Its by Tyler Jacobson, the illustrator who created the covers of the PHB, DMG, SCAG, and various adventure books (Out of the Abyss for certain, and I think he mightve had some illustrations in Curse of Strahd. Maybe more). Dudes prolific as hell and his work is a beauty to behold. [Check out his gallery.](URL - The flavour is fairly focused on defining the race as hedonistic artists, and that kind of focus is good. Its basically this is the basis for this races personality which is 100% something that more races should make clear, because its often why people pick a race like this in the first place. - The Exotic Body trait is well written. #### The Bad - Its overpowered as hell. - Female satyrs dont exist, the text describes, when the illustration is clearly of a female satyr. - resorting to their enchanted flutes if necessary to win over their victims is a little date rapey. - The children born from these encounters are always satyrs themselves, and are usually stolen from the mothers by their satyr kin. Okay jesus christ. - unstable appetite I think you mean insatiable appetite but okay. - 45 ft. base walking speed is absolutely preposterous. - In general, the description for the traits and abilities is vague and poorly written all around. You cant just write This attack deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. Thats not how abilities are written in the PHB, which is very explicit about the details. These leave out the details of how it actually works; at least look at the EE Aarokocra or Waterborne UA Minotaur for examples of how natural weapons are worded. - Additionally, they get a goat kick as a natural weapon (worded poorly, of course) as well as a horn attack as a natural weapon but only if they charge first. Its annoying that their natural weapons are separated in this way. - There are two main examples of charge attacks: the goat from the MM, and the UA Minotaur. The description for Goats Charge emulates neither of those charge attacks. - Using the panpipes as an arcane focus is a really weird ability. You also dont get the panpipes through your trait, just the ability to use them, which is annoying. I think giving a race an arcane focus is a strange and non-ideal trait. - Double proficiency in acrobatics is extremely inadvisable. The dwarves are the only PHB race that get double proficiency in anything (and its worded in a way that is significantly less ambiguous and actually takes into account how it interacts with other abilities like Expertise) and they only use it for History checks specifically to identify stonework. Id tread much more carefully about granting double proficiency to an ability check, and the creator of this race did not tread carefully at all. - You cant have an ability thats just Advantage to Persuasion and Intimidation checks. Thats poorly worded and grossly overpowered. What the hell is the problem with just giving a race proficiency in an ability check? Whys it always gotta be flat-out advantage, or double proficiency, or some other mad scientist conconction? If this person designed the Half-Orc, instead of proficiency in intimidation theyd get like double advantage and a +4 bonus versus humanoids or some other crazy cronenburgian creation. Number one rule of thumb, for anything, is Keep It Simple, Stupid. Man I wrote a lot about the damn proficiencies. I hope yall can take some wisdom away from this. Im just filled up to my eyeballs with frickin wisdom. #### The Verdict This is one of the most poorly designed races Ive seen yet, and after that god damn cyclops thats saying something. It pains me so much more because Im *certain* that theres a usable race in here somewhere, but in order to get at it youd have to butcher its current traits beyond recognition. #### Implementation In its current form its overpowered and its got way too many abilities. Its unfocused, poorly written, and not at all easy to implement in a practical way. As an exercise, how can we make a satyr thats actually decent? 1. What are the two biggest advantages that a Satyr has over a generic human? 2. What are two cool pieces of flavour that we can add to the Satyr to represent their day-to-day life? Ive never considered the stereotypical satyr to be able to use its horns/hooves as a legitimate weapon. I see them as the passive and skittish Mr. Tumnus. Nor do I associate with them the ability to see in the dark. So we can ignore those traits and any others like them, as a personal preference. Feel free to add a natural weapon, knowing that it makes them a tad more powerful  although its probably still not overpowered with a goat kick/horn ram that just deals 1d6 bludgeoning. I also prefer encapsulating spellcasting ability with a single cantrip rather than go full tiefling progression of spellcasting because thats really hard to balance. Is there a cantrip that encapsulates the magic of the satyr? The answer is yes. So lets go over our new satyr race: Advantages: Fey Ancestry and Improved Speed. Flavour: Proficiency in a musical instrument (pan pipes) and the Friends cantrip for brief social encounters that represent the fleeting petty nature of the fey. And then we include the Exotic Body trait, which I quite like because its well written. For ability scores we give them +2 Cha (to encourage going bard) and +1 Dex, and youve got yourself a race thats actually pretty low-key and flavourful. Musicus score of **5**, ignoring the detriments of Exotic Body. There. That ones for free. Youre welcome. Its a fairly weak race as it stands, almost certainly worse than the PHB elves, but weaker is better than overpowered, and the main thing that it has going for it is the flavour of being a trickster fey. If youre concerned about it being too weak, add a natural weapon, or give it an additional ability score improvement to Wisdom. ## Satyr Traits ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Charisma score increases by 2, and your Dexterity score increases by 1. ***Age.*** Satyrs reach adulthood at the age of 50, and live to be 500. ***Alignment.*** Satyrs are universally chaotic. ***Size.*** Most satyrs stand a little taller than humans on account of their goat legs. They are usually about 6-7 feet tall. Your size is Medium. ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 35 feet. ***Exotic Body.*** Normal articles don't fit you, and your people do not clothe or armor themselves. Any garments you wish to wear must be custom-made with a material cost equal to the base item plus 50%. This does not include any service fee a craftsman may charge you. ***Fey Ancestry.*** You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic cant put you to sleep. ***Fleeting Fey.*** You know the Friends cantrip. ***Natural Musician.*** You have proficiency with pan pipes. ***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan. # More Races Alright, thats five races and I oughtta pack this up. Heres a list of other races that have been taken from the Monster Manual. I encourage you to get involved and start looking at how balanced they are and whether or not its feasible to implement them in a campaign. You can find these races in an alphabetically-sorted list at URL - Azer - Barbed Devil - Bullywug - Flumph - Galeb Duhr - Gith - Gnoll - Kuo-Toa - Myconid - Ogrillon EDIT: Emboldened the satyr traits. Added an oxford comma to ""speak, read, and write""."
361,vulnerability,DnD,Help me with my Homebrew: The Mirror Shield Giant,1,551vzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/551vzi/help_me_with_my_homebrew_the_mirror_shield_giant/,2016-09-29 22:21:20,"For context, I want to do a mirror themed dungeon, with multiple puzzles involving a magic mirrors that each have different rules. I'm still in the beginnings of creating it, but I had the thought that it would be awesome to have the final boss be a stone giant (or atleast a creature stated like such) that wields a massive tower shield that is actually one huge mirror. This is all just brainstorming and early development. I have several ideas of what could work and would appreciate your feedback on it, but am also very interested in what ideas you guys would think are fun. Let me know in the comments! * Take a template for a Stone Giant, but make him a Legendary Creature (3 Legendary Resistances, 3 Legendary Actions). * Give him a giant mirror shield that completely covers one side of his space, granting him a +5 bonus to AC from anyone on the other side. OR possibly make it a wall that prevents any medium sized attackers without reach from attacking, and provides 3/4th cover from ranged attacks. * First Legendary Action: Re-position, the giant moves the shield to cover a different flank. * Second Legendary Action: Shield Shove, the giant attempts to shove all creatures within 10 feet up to 10 feet away. Opposing Strength checks. * Third Legendary Action: Release the Opposites (2 actions) For every creature within 30 feet that has a reflection, an equal number of Mirrored Opposites emerge from the mirrors surface, aligned with the Giant. * Mirror Opposites have the same stats as the creatures they mirror, except are vulnerable to thunder, force and bludgeoning damage, immune to physic and poison, and have 1/4 (or maybe static 20) the hit points. They act just after their corresponding creature in the initiative order (or maybe before?). Upon reaching zero hit points, they shatter into glass shards, creating difficult terrain in a five foot diameter at the spot of their deaths (OR deals 1d4 damage to anyone who steps in their spot). * The mirror can be targeted and has an AC of 15 and 60 hp (unsure about this amount), vulnerability to thunder, force, and bludgeoning damage and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Upon reaching zero hp, the mirror shatters and is unusable by the giant. The ground around the shattered mirror becomes difficult terrain (or deals 1d4 per 5 feet of movement) in a 10 foot radius. * If any Mirrored Opposites still live after the mirror has been shattered, they may return to the frame and create a new mirror with HP equal to the amount they had remaining. Multiple mirror creatures may return to the mirror and heal it (and all probably would after it breaks) * An attack that would hit the giant but is blocked by the mirror's +5 AC deals damage to the mirror. For AoE effects, the mirror takes damage as well. The idea behind this is to encourage maneuvering into better positions and spreading out, though I would create the battlefield to make this a little more risky: the threat of traps, a wall on one side and a small cliff edge on the other, or maybe a molten glass pool or something. Rather than gang up on one creature, they have the strategy of trying to destroy the mirror quickly to prevent more mirror creatures spawning and beginning a cycle of increasingly more enemies. I would provide plenty of clues in the dungeon as to the nature of this fight and what to expect. I might even suggest that targeting the shield is an option. A couple more ideas I thought of but am unsure about. * Give him mirrored armor that grants resistance to magic but vulnerability to thunder, bludgeoning and force. Depending on the level and makeup of the party this could be serious overkill, but its tempting to shore up the fact that he's still just as vulnerable to spells as a standard Stone Giant. Or, I could do the following: * Mirrored armor that allows him to add his armor bonus (+5) to Dex saving throws against magic (except spells dealing psychic, thunder, bludgeoning, or force?) Or: * Any AoE effect originating from the reflective side is stopped by the mirror, dealing no damage to the giant and only to the mirror. So lightning bolt would be stopped, but fireball could be aimed above the mirror or behind it and still hit. * Include a different legendary action where all creatures within 10 feet of the mirror must make a wisdom (or con?) saving throw or be cursed for as long as they remain in front of the mirror. While cursed, any damage dealt to the mirror is halved, the rest is dealt to the cursed individually. * Make the arena walled by mirrors and move the Release the Opposites Legendary Action to a Lair Action, and any creature within 30 feet of the walls spawns an opposite (Or possibly two, if they are in a corner?) It would mean figuring out two more lair actions and replacing the legendary action. Anyway, throw some unique ideas out there for me, help me figure out the CR of a creature like this, and tell me what you think of the suggestions. Thanks!"

366,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Using Minion Groups! (lots of examples inside),12,57ill4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/57ill4/5e_using_minion_groups_lots_of_examples_inside/,2016-10-15 07:40:49,"***Wall incoming; skip to the next bolded section if you just want the monsters!*** To start with, I may not have liked 4e much at all, but one thing I really liked was the concept of a 'minion' monster. I could fill a room with these guys and make an encounter feel ""real"" to the players, even if they were glass cannons. Yes, it was weird they only had 1hp, and that was an issue, but it still added something to the encounters, rewarded taking AoE instead of just spiking attacks, and kept the encounters going. Now in 5e, it's really difficult to throw multiple monsters at a party while following the CR guidelines. Which, by the way, are *really good* at estimating actual encounter difficulty in my experience, and the monster building options in 5e are far and away the best and easiest to balance. However, you still have an issue with the quantity of 'figures' you can throw out at once. Take a 1st level party of 4 PCs. A medium encounter has an XP budget of 200, meaning that theoretically I can throw 8 1/8 CR monsters (25 XP each) at the party. However, because of the encounter multiplier effect described in the DMG, I have to make that 2.5 times the total, or 500 XP for the budget, which now puts me WAY over the ""deadly"" level of 400. Why? Because each of those bodies isn't just a body, it's damage per round in addition to a block of HP, and that many 'swings' is incredibly dangerous to our squishy level 1s. Really, a ""medium"" difficulty encounter of only 1/8 CR critters can only have 4 or so of them, which seems...bland, given the options at that CR. And the issue to me gets worse as levels go up, because you start throwing massive numbers of low-CR bodies into a combat, but they can't do much to the PCs and have little defense against getting obliterated. So we have mass combat, which is fun, tactical, and engaging, but it is really hard to balance at low levels and doesn't scale well at high levels. So how do you handle this? I was trying to figure something out and see if anyone else had a nice solution, when I came upon Angry DM's concepts of [Paragon Monsters](URL and [Minion Groups](URL This was the solution! I highly recommend reading those articles (as well as Angry's other articles on monster building), but the basic concept is this: Take the HP and Damage/Round of a monster and split it out among multiple bodies. Each body has its own hit points, but can use the collective movement or make the group's attacks. The reason this works so well is that you can limit the Damage/Round, which is normally the limiting factor in throwing lots of bodies at the party. A group of 4 minions with a multi-attack of only 2 means that 2 roll to hit while the others get into position, or move towards/away from danger, launch covering fire, etc. But you're only dealing 2 attacks in damage, and that makes the group an effective monster at a lower CR. I've used a lot of minion groups (and paragons, for bosses) over my past dozen or so sessions, and they really truly work, especially at low levels. I have put a dozen enemies against level 1s and 20+ figures into a battle against parties of levels 2-3, with some solo-monsters in the mix, and it was a real fight; I found that whatever I set for the budget was reflected in the danger, resources used, and PCs downed (or not). It matched my expectations perfectly. Since I've had so much success with these, I thought I'd share them with you all. I also haven't had a session in awhile, so my DM activities have been focused on playing with monster design... ***Alright, here be the monsters!*** [FULL ALBUM (12 minion group monsters)](URL For the creation of the stat blocks, I used the [D&amp;D Monster Generator Tool](URL *CR 1/4* [Mob of Kobold Scramblers](URL [Deep Goblin Swarmer Mob](URL These are the little guys running around your party's feet, throwing rocks and daggers while their friends try to get in position to shank them.

Versatile with built-in tactics to make the battle interesting. Made an orc version to show that you can make minion groups meet any need, though notice that they have one fewer member to balance the stats and Aggressive. *CR 1* [Orc Troop](URL For when you want 4 ill-tempered greataxes at one time. [Skeleton Swarm](URL [Zombie Crush](URL Undead, the classics of horde combat! Zombies were actually really hard to balance given their Undead Fortitude, but with these groups, you can throw 6 skeletons or 5 zombies in combat for the price of a single 1 CR monster in the budget, which makes for better undead encounters. Please note that the skeletons here have the old resistance to piercing and vulnerability to bludgeoning, which just feels wrong otherwise to me. If you don't like that, remove it! [Hyena Pack](URL See Wolves below. *CR 2* [Wolf Pack](URL Here is where the encounter budget really fails us without minion groups. We have a monster with Pack Tactics, but it is really difficult to put an actual 'pack' together for it to fight with! Now you have a ready-made pack of Hyenas or Wolves, where you describe some of the animals nipping at the party or distracting them while another comes in for the kill or sneaks around through the trees. It actually makes sense, and reinforces the point of having Pack Tactics in the first place: hunting together, and supporting each other. [Archer Company](URL I will readily admit that I haven't tested these guys, and would recommend caution throwing them against a party of only melee fighters with lots of open ground and distance between the groups for obvious reasons. As with any monster, you should consider the party make-up first. However, this could also be a great addition to a large army combat, and fits a needed role, in my opinion. For tactics, they just lob volleys of inaccurate arrows at the enemy and hope they stick, and pray they don't have their HP tested. *CR 3* [Dwarf Phalanx](URL I really only created these guys to test out making a minion group with a slightly higher CR, but I like how they turned out. As with the other groups, they basically have tactics built in, where they would advance as a line and support each other. I combined and tweaked the Steadfast of a Bearded Devil and Surefooted of the Dao to represent a solid formation. I'd love to hear your thoughts on these guys and all of the other minion groups!"
367,vulnerability,DnD,Torn between a couple backstories for a blood hunter.,1,57kv2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/57kv2a/torn_between_a_couple_backstories_for_a_blood/,2016-10-15 17:06:11,"So my DM has given me the go ahead to play a Blood Hunter in his CoS campaign and I'm really excited cause I haven't had the chance yet! But I'm torn between a couple backstories that also depend on the ""Order"" in which I end up going with, so I'd like to share some info on them and see which you guys think sounds better :D Also I have talked to my DM about which he thinks is better or fits the current party better, but he jus gives the ""what ever you prefer"" reply lol So anyway in both cases he's gonna be a former pirate captain, but how he comes upon his Blood Hunter powers is what changes the back story and class options. The first is the Order of the Lycan choice; Basically he was a fearsome pirate captain with a very loyal crew who would follow him into the abyss. They'd attack and raid ships and settlements in and around the Sea of Fallen stars, and their ship had a large cannon crafted onto the front of it which provided them with powerful options for catching as well as sieging their targets. One night they decided to make land in a port on the far northern end of the sea, mainly to restock on some supplies. However the captain decided to go for a stroll in into the woods a little ways, feeling good about their previous haul and letting his crew do a bit of celebrating without having to worry about their captain's presence. During this walk however he is attacked by a werewolf, he manages to kill it but it bites him pretty good on the neck. He returns in a hurry, but doesn't mention anything to his crew. He doesn't know how lycanthropy works so he doesn't want to frighten the men for nothing. Everything goes well for roughly another month, but on the next full moon he transforms into a hulking werewolf while most of his crew is sleeping, and he ends up slaughtering them all to a man. He awakes the next day to the sight of bodies and blood strewn across his ship, and he knows the truth of it immediately. He manages to get the ship back to shore, through much effort, but he sinks it, offering it as the tomb and grave for his loyal crew. He secludes himself out of shame for a time, but eventually hears about an order of hunters who have mastered the taint of lycanthropy, just a rumor, but it's better then nothing in his eyes. While looking for them he again changes and attacks a camp of merchants on the road, but is stopped by a couple blood hunters passing through the area, the ones where the rumors came from. He changes back once they've beaten him, and he begs them to teach him how to control his urges. They argue for a time but recognize him based on his reputation as a powerful pirate captain who disappeared some time ago, and they decide they can use him. So they train him in their ways, in order to control the lycanthropy, and he makes it through all their tests and trials to become a full-fledged blood hunter. EDIT: Basically in this story his goal or reason for being with the current party is mainly due to him just looking for a new life and wanting to make enough money to buy himself a new ship. He doesn't wish to return to piracy, per say, but he'd rather do his job as a blood hunter from the sea, where he's always been more at home. The second is for the ghostslayers option, and in this option he'd also have the Revenant subrace option from UA (which the Dm is still currently thinking about how he wants to work the goal I'm about to explain into his story): Starts the same way, fearsome pirate with loyal crew, but in this ""timeline"" he gets into a large scale battle on the sea with a number of ships form one of the coastal kingdoms on the Sea of Fallen Stars. Him and his crew manage to sink several of the enemy ships thanks to their powerful canon, but in the end they are sunk by some magic users aboard one of the enemy ships, in a fiery explosion that completely destroys the ship and it's massive canon. Some blood hunters in the area see this happen, and recognize the sails of the pirate ship that explodes and the reputation of it's captain. Ghostslayers are essentially obsessed with the time of death as well as the passing on of souls and of when they're not, so they scour the wreckage that washes up on shore a couple days later and find the burn and blackened remains of the captain, but no one else. They perform a ritual that resummons his spirit, at first they just wanted to talk with it, but it surprisingly attaches itself back to his corporeal form, and then promptly faints due to the pain he was in from the injuries. This intrigues them and they heal him up, and decide to teach him and train him, for he hasn't yet fully regained his memories thus just goes along with it. Once more he passes all their tests and trials to become a full fledged blood hunter, but one day he feels a pull back to the sea, and upon following it he finds himself back at the wreckage of his ship. Suddenly he is assaulted by a blast of psychic energy as the soul of one of his crewmates that had remained manages to impart their shared memories back to him, which triggered the rest to return as well. The former captain discovers that the souls of the crew were cursed by someone aboard one of the surviving ships that had attacked them, likely also the reason so many ships had attacked them to begin with. he then puts his crewmans soul to rest and comes to realize his purpose and goal in this new life, to put the souls of his crew to rest and afterwards take revenge on whoever it was who cursed them in the first place. So there you go, a lycan pirate or a ghost pirate lol I know that was a bit of a read so thanks to anyone who stuck through it, hopefully you liked it at least xP Anyway, purely lore wise which do you prefer? Which sounds more unique, or which sounds more fun to RP, and so on along that train of thought. And then also a question for anyone who's played or at least played next to/extensively looked at the blood hunter class, which of the two Orders to you prefer in game? Is one stronger then the other? Is one more fun or unique to play in combat? Are there any downsides aside from the lycans silver vulnerability that I should know about? And as a side question, is the revenant subrace options OP? My DM seemed a bit worried about it cause you can come back to life after 24 hours of your death, but my argument is that if I do manage to complete my goals then that character is DEAD-DEAD, like never coming back no mater what kind of magic. So yeah for earlier levels it's nice cause I won't need ot worry about his death as much, but he'll never actually be a long term character cause he WILL die at some point. So what are you thoughts? Should I just avoid that subrace, or is it ok to use in your opinions? Thanks in advance to any answers and insights you folk share! :)"
368,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Clerics appear to be awful at killing demons?,36,57lluj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/57lluj/5e_clerics_appear_to_be_awful_at_killing_demons/,2016-10-15 22:08:04,"Almost all demons and fiends have advantage on saving throws against magic, and at least +7 to all saving throws. Given that clerics only have one damaging cantrip, and that cantrip is one which imposes a saving throw, this seems to severely disadvantage clerics. This is compounded by the fact that virtually no demons have vulnerability to radiant damage, meaning that whatever damage you do deal is pretty minor compared to what the demon can inflict on you. This also appears to make the banishment spell a complete waste of a 4th level spell slot - since against a level 8 cleric with 20 wisdom, a demon with +10 to charisma saving throws needs to roll 5 or lower TWICE. This seems counter intuitive to me, since clerics should be especially effective against demons, given that they're evil and the sworn enemies of clerics."

I have been helping them shape their ideas to keep the flavor of the race but to keep them from being too overpowered. One that I am having trouble with is a swarm character. She wants to be the Queen of a swarm of some type, not necessarily insect. I was thinking of restricting her form to a mobile hive of some sort that could wear armor and wield weapons. I usually create races by taking a standard race and replace each bonus or ability with something of equivalent power but I keep ending up making it overpowered in some way. A google search didn't find anything good for suggestions so I thought asking here would be a nice start. We are playing 5e and she is either making a ranger or rogue. EDIT: This is what I am working with right now Sentient Swarm: Ability Score Dex:+2, Wis:+1, Size: Small, Speed:25 ft Darkvision, Advantage on checks to search an area, At will can send a section of the swarm out to manipulate objects weighing less then a lb and swarm moves 5 ft per round. Kinda wanna give a swarm form ability that is limited by rounds per short rest or long rest depending on how powerful. Also feel the need to put in an area of effect vulnerability of some sort for balance. "

To give some background, I currently have 8 level 5 PCs. For this upcoming fight well have all 8 players at the table. We have a Vengeance Paladin, Totem Barbarian, Land Druid, Battlemaster Fighter, Beast Ranger, Death Cleric, Abjuration Wizard and a Lore Bard. &amp;nbsp; The party have come across the remains of a long dead green dragon. The beast was killed in its lair and so the party find themselves in a room full of goodies with no apparent defences. After some shenanigans the party look up to see the skeletal remains of the dragon re-animating in front of them and this is where we called the session for the night. &amp;nbsp; Upto this point I dont think the party has had real challenge so my goal with this encounter is to create something that poses a real danger to the party, but hopefully not too dangerous, that if the party and smart about will be able to take down. &amp;nbsp; To that end, I have taken /u/DieGiantMonsterDies skeleton template (found [here]( URL and applied to a Green Dragon to get a base idea and have then done some tweaks as well. By my calculations the difficulty for this encounter is around CR 10. &amp;nbsp; Armor Class | 17 :--: | :--: Hit Points | 200 Speed | 40 &amp;nbsp; STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 23 | 12 | 15 | 6 | 8 | 5 &amp;nbsp; **Damage Immunities** Poison **Condition Immunities** Exhausted, Poisoned **Damage Vulnerability** Bludgeoning **Senses** Darkvision 60ft. &amp;nbsp; **Multiattack.** The Dragon can make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage. **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. **Poison Aura.** With no way to properly contain the gas cloud, this Skeletal Dragon instead emits a poisonous aura. If a character ends it turn within melee range of the dragon it takes 6 (2d6) poison damage. &amp;nbsp; At some point in the fight the dragon will attempt to take flight and escape. Given that its wings no longer have any substance though the dragon is unable to flee, instead managing to rise off the ground 10-15 feet before slamming back down. Anyone within a 50 feet radius must make a Dexterity (DC 15) saving throw. On a failed save they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All feedback is most welcome. Anything you think I can should change to make the encounter more fun, rewarding etc. No number here is set in stone and everything can be adjusted. My biggest fear is that the party will either just beat down on this thing within 2 or 3 rounds, or the fight will go on so long that the dragon wins by attrition. &amp;nbsp; Edit: I have made some changes to the monster and uploaded it as a Word Doc [here](URL as I really couldn't be fucked with mark-up editing. &amp;nbsp; TL;DR &amp;nbsp; * AC decreased to allow party to hit more frequently. * HP increased to lower possibility of a boring 1 round encounter. * Strength lowered slightly, hit bonuses and damage adjusted accordingly. * Legendary actions introduced. Giving the dragon a way to summon ""adds"" to soak up party actions and provides interaction with terrain. "

How could I scale the Rakshasa down in order for it to be a difficult encounter, but still achievable for a party of four L7 characters (plus probably one or two lower leveled NPCs, around level 4 or 5)? Would it be a matter of taking down the spell immunity to L3 spells? Possibly weakening the immunity to nonmagical weapons? Add another vulnerability?"

Reappears after 120 Feats: 1 FEAT: ENTANGLING EXHALATION (RotDr) breath weapon deals only half its normal damage; however, any creature that takes damage from your breath weapon becomes entangled and takes an extra 1d6 points of damage, of the same energy type as normally dealt by your breath weapon, each round at the start of your turn. This effect lasts for 1d4 rounds. 1 HUMAN FEAT: DREADFUL WRATH (PGtF) When you charge, make a full attack, or cast a spell that targets an enemy or includes an enemy in its area, you gain the frightful presence ability for that round.

Id start combat by breathing Entangling breath on either the biggest enemy from 30 away, or Id attempt to catch several lower threat enemies in a cone. Unless the enemies have evasion, this is guaranteed to hit, causing creatures to move at half speed, and granting a -2 to attack rolls and a -4 to dexterity (lowering reflex saves). This also can tie up enemy spellcasters, limiting how many spells they can cast. By rushing myself and my dark companion to the most threatening enemy, the enemy is suffering -6 to saving throws without a save because Im adjacent. From this position, I can make a full attack to attempt to make the target shaken, followed by a curse, followed by Morghuth-Iron dex poison, followed by Sudden Stunning. Alternatively, I can use Tashas Hideous Laughter to attempt to neutralize the foe, while still shaking enemies, but saving my curse for later.

Debuffs Dark Companion (level 6) No Save Enemies adjacent to illusory companion suffer -2 to Saves and AC. Energy Drained (Level 16) No Save; Touch Attack subject to Spell Resistance The character gains one or more negative levels, which might permanently drain the characters levels. If the subject has at least as many negative levels as Hit Dice, he dies. Each negative level gives a creature the following penalties: -1 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, ability checks; loss of 5 hit points; and -1 to effective level (for determining the power, duration, DC, and other details of spells or special abilities). In addition, a spellcaster loses one spell or spell slot from the highest spell level castable. Entangled (Level 1) Reflex The character is ensnared. Being entangled impedes movement, but does not entirely prevent it unless the bonds are anchored to an immobile object or tethered by an opposing force. An entangled creature moves at half speed, cannot run or charge, and takes a -2 penalty on all attack rolls and a -4 penalty to Dexterity. An entangled character who attempts to cast a spell must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + the spells level) or lose the spell. Hexblade Cursed (Level 3) Greater Hexblade Curse (Level 9) Will -2 (greater -4) penalty on attacks, saves, ability checks, skill checks and damage rolls. Blinded (Level 12) Will -2 penalty to Armor Class, lose Dex bonus to AC, move at  speed, -4 penalty on Search checks and most Str &amp; Dex-based skill checks. All opponents are considered to have total concealment Nauseated (Level 14) Fortitude Experiencing stomach distress. Nauseated creatures are unable to attack, cast spells, concentrate on spells, or do anything else requiring attention. Only move action. Quilled (Level 9) Reflex Lodged quills impose a -1 penalty on attacks, saves, and checks per quill. The save DC is Dexterity-based. A quill can be removed safely with a DC 20 Heal check; otherwise, removing a quill deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. Shaken (Level 1) Will A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. Shaken is a less severe state of fear than frightened or panicked. Slowed (Level 16) Will A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both. Additionally, it takes a 1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves. A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed. Round/level Stunned (Level 5) Reflex A stunned creature drops everything held, cant take actions, takes a -2 penalty to AC, and loses his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). Winter Chilled (Level 1) No Save; Affects living nonfey Creatures within 5 feet take a morale penalty to saves equal to Charisma Bonus"

EDIT: Changed immunity to resistance EDIT 2: Increased HP, added a vulnerability EDIT 3: Changed the damage of the whip attack to lessen its usage in melee range"

382,vulnerability,DnD,[5e] Lessons learned from running a combat with 11 PC's,46,4rig7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4rig7x/5e_lessons_learned_from_running_a_combat_with_11/,2016-07-06 23:26:02,"Hello all, Last night we ran our annual summer mega-game. We had 11 PC's around the table, playing a melee-heavy 6th level party. They had to defend a town against an assault. This was the largest group I've DM'd. Overall, the game was fun, but there were 2 or 3 players who were simply not engaged (in the past, they were). ** What went well ** * Careful review of all character sheets prior to the game was helpful. Reviewing mechanical details, confirming spells slots, reviewing + to hit, weapon damage, AC, etc * A cheat sheet was very helpful for quickly resolving combats. The cheat sheet had player name, AC, normal + to hit, HP, speed, normal weapon damage, race, class and role. * A monster grid was also very helpful. The grid had the monster manual page, movements attacks, speed, resistances and vulnerability. It made reference during combat very fast. * When players introduced their characters at the start of the game, they simply read their race, name, and then their bonds, ideals, flaws and personality traits. This got them in their character really well, and maintained the role for the duration of the game. * Constantly reminding players the order of initiative, and ""who is going next"" was very helpful to keep the game running. ** Things to do different next time ** * The party (wisely) created a few tactical chokepoints. They were facing a far superior enemy force (a deadly encounter). The problem was some characters had lots of fighting, and some had little fighting. I think creating a more open, fluid battle-space makes D&amp;D more fun for larger groups. A PC barbarian simply held action the whole time. * I still don't have a satisfying way of looking up spell effects during a game. I don't like electronic stuff at the table. Many spells were cast where I had to look up duration, area of effect, and such. * The assault had a long setup (actual time one hour of planning and considering choices). Next time, a combat at the very start of the game to keep the tempo going, and whet player appetite would be helpful. Overall, our game was really fun, and I would suggest the key to successful large-scale battles is planning, planning, planning. "

384,vulnerability,DnD,Question about multi-classing a marksman into death knight in 5e,0,4l0d51,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4l0d51/question_about_multiclassing_a_marksman_into/,2016-05-26 02:03:00,"So I'm making my first planned character and I want to really make it my own while still making it match up to a certain archetype. I intend to make a human marksman specialty gunslinger who dips into being a death knight at least enough to get into order of the ebony blades, but I'm really bending a lot of the class rules to make him fit the character I've created; a neutral evil psychopath obsessed with death and the number four (in eastern world 4 is associated with death). ----- So far I've planned for: (As a marksman): a high maintenance time moderate durability four shot pistol which splits the two shots a six shot pistol would have between the first three shots evenly from a roll after reloading and the fourth shot as another roll during the shot, inability to double attack unless for adding an extra damage roll to the fourth shot, and no quick reload or reload increases in exchange for a ""gun waltz"" ability wherein he can move an additional 5 feet for each of these kinds of abilities during reload and first 3 shots. Additionally for lead torrent at class level 20, I would change it to four shots such that the first three have a 20 to crit without other modifiers, whereas the last shot has 17-20 as crit without modifiers. (As a death knight): Mostly just get to ebony blades improved crit chance. (As lvl 1 stats (normal + human bonus)): 16 dexterity (15+1) 14 charisma 13 intelligence 13 strength (12+1) 11 wisdom (10+1) 9 constitution (8+1) ----- To gm/dms: Is this even acceptable? I know I'm it's sort of getting ahead of things for a character I haven't even started. I tried to balance out his extra damage with a bit of reliance on his shots hitting and giving him slippery moments of vulnerability. Could you give me some suggestions as to how I could make this work? Any suggestions on what die to use for each part? I know these classes aren't supposed to even touch each other normally, but if I could make this work I think I'd have a great time with a campaign with some friends in the summer as a character who can act as a foil to those on the good side of the alignment chart. I'd be happy to discuss this in long exchange. Thanks in advance!"

386,vulnerability,DnD,An analysis of the 5e weapon design (xpost r/dndnext),36,4n4pz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4n4pz8/an_analysis_of_the_5e_weapon_design_xpost_rdndnext/,2016-06-08 22:19:10,"Background: I'm planning to do a homebrew rework of the 5e weapons system to make the choices more meaningful. I started by closely examining the current system, and have found that a lot of the design choices don't seem to make much sense. Of the 37 weapons in the PHB, 11 serve no gameplay purpose. Feats could be added to make certain weapons better, but it would be preferable to make a weapon choice viable without feats involved. In addition, some of the weapon properties could be tidied up a bit. From a balance perspective, it is obvious that martial weapons, which require additional proficiency, should be better than their simple counterparts, if only slightly. Positive weapon properties such as Finesse, Light, Reach,Thrown and Versatile, should come at a cost of damage, while negative properties such as Two-handed, Loading and Heavy should come with extra damage, in comparison to a weapon with no properties. Some weapons appear to be primitive or improvised weapons that can be wielded by enemies for theme. It would probably to easier to cut them out, and just have them as flavor for enemy attacks. In terms of damage types, there are relatively few monsters that have a specific resistance or vulnerability to bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage. Poison can be applied to to the latter two, making them generally slightly better than bludgeoning. Regardless, I will treat weapon variants with different damage types as having a purpose. The weapons players use will generally be starting gear, or magical versions found as loot. This makes the costs relatively unimportant. Weight is also a slight negative, but only a handful of weapons are outside the 2-6 lb range. --- Now, on to the weapons themselves. I won't mention every one, only those that vary from expectation. * The greatclub and mace are both made pointless by the quarterstaff, which can function as either as required. * The spear is even better, as it can be thrown, and apply poison * The javelin can be thrown further than the spear, but doesn't get extra damage from 2 hand melee. This is fine. * The trident is the martial version of the spear. It costs and weighs more, but is identical otherwise. This is the hardest decision to justify from all the weapons. * The flail is just a warhammer without the versatile property. * The glaive and halberd are literally identical. * The morningstar is literally a heavier and more expensive version of the warpick. * The club is a light hammer that can't be thrown. EXCEPT, any weapon can be thrown (1d4 20/60), which is the same as the light hammer. Why aren't the d4 weapons just listed as being throwable? * The sickle is a handaxe that does less damage. * Ranged weapons all have their own niche. Darts are worse versions of daggers, but are 40 times cheaper, so they get a pass. Now for some slightly more contentious ones - * The whip is 2 dice sizes weaker than the rapier, in exchange for reach. The other reach weapons only lose 1 dice size. * The Heavy property is basically unnecessary. Every 2-handed martial weapon is heavy, and ONLY these ones are heavy. The only exception is the lance, which is a special case anyway. * If the heavy property is to be kept, the greatclub should certainly have it. It weighs more than the greataxe, which *is* heavy. * Why does the blowgun require martial training? Is it really harder to use than a shortbow, crossbow, or sling? Additionally, it probably needs a special property of not revealing your position or alerting the enemy on a miss. * Strangely, the hand crossbow has the Light property, which only affects melee attacks. This is only useful when using it to bash someone as an improvised weapon. This property is not referenced in the Crossbow Master feat, and could be removed. * The net has disadvantage to hit, whether you are 5 feet away, or 15. This is because ranged attacks at 5 feet have disadvantage (unless you have crossbow expert). I'm sure this is not intended behavior. Please let me know if I made any mistakes or missed anything, or if you have suggestions on how to make weapon choice more interesting! *Edit, added the net"
387,vulnerability,DnD,How could I flavor a physical manifestation of a Warlock pact without it being obnoxious?,4,4gsx5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/4gsx5m/how_could_i_flavor_a_physical_manifestation_of_a/,2016-04-28 17:19:42,"So I'll try and exp[lain what I'm getting at here without going into too much unnecessary detail. The main idea is that I have a warlock who isn't thrilled about the arrangement, having made a deal when no other choice was available, and rather than a clear, direct connection with the patron, the pact is manifested by a gemstone, which acts as an arcane focus for the warlock powers. So basically, the pact was made with the patron, and in exchange for the powers I needed at the time, I'm now sort of dealing with the consequences, though I see it as a ""curse"" of sorts. In any case, the Patron isn't really too hands on, not terribly interested in what I do after I make the pact and accept the price. (unless the DM decides to go there, of course) So I'm here with this stone, and it's a representation of the choice I made, the price I paid, and my unavoidable fate. I'm not pleased with how things have turned out, but there's nothing I can do about it. And I was thinking that I could have my character tied in some way to this stone, making it a sort of weakness. This is where my ideas sort of get fuzzy and indistinct. One thought is something like attacking the stone causes my character debilitating pain, and/or some kind of consequence if the stone is ever too far away from me. That's the kind of idea I'm going for, but the ideas aren't as solid as I'd like, and I don't have enough experience to really know how things would play out in the long run. I don't want it to be like, a container for my soul or anything, but I do want there to be some reason I have to keep the thing around. It's not precious, but I need to protect it regardless, making it sort of symbolic of the burden I feel I'm carrying. The main issue is the distance thing. I like the idea of SOMETHING happening if it's too far from me, but I'm not sure what would be a good idea. Obviously it's going to prevent me from using a lot of magic right off the bat, which is a start, I guess, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable adding much else, since while it could be cool in theory, it would likely be much less fun if it ever came into play. For example, going full Madoka Magica and having my character fall unconscious if it's too far is nice flavor, but if it actually happened, it would be awful. Just pain would be kinda boring, but it could work. Perhaps debilitating weakness? Exhaustion levels? I dunno, spitballing ideas would be great, I don't know exactly what I'm looking for, I'm hoping some genius will take some angle I totally haven't thought of but is completely perfect. Tanks in advance! **TL;DR** - My Warlock pact is manifested by a gemstone that I use to focus my power. I want the stone to be a vulnerability, and have some ideas I'd like fleshing out on: I like the idea of being able to cause my character pain through the stone, and Would also like some kind of bad thing to happen if it's ever too far from me. What are some ideas that would be fun and reasonable?"

A great gaseous void that creeps upon the vales between this reality and It consumes all that stands between It and its goal. This gaseous entity seeks only its goal, as a result it cares not for the whims of the mortal and immortal realms as it will consume them as well in the end. Those who find the small pockets of its horrid fumes within the mortal realm may gain incredible power for the price of the soul that erodes away when exposed to the vapor.

You gain +1 ac when targeted by poison, acid and fire damage. As well as the ability to reroll saving throws against poison, acid and fire damage twice a day. You find your body no longer needs to consume food or drink. Gaseous Form At 6th level, you learn to use your gaseous fuelled body to become incorporeal for a short time . When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to become incorporeal for 1 round. While this occurs you cannot cause any damage through any means. You gain immunity to all melee and ranged piercing, bludgeoning, slashing and force, lightning, acid, and poison magic damage. As well as resistance to magical weapons.

Abjurant Champion- Martial Arcanist *unsure where to take the build from there* Stats- Prioritize Intelligence, then Con. Cha can be as low as necissary to still cast warmage spells. Int will synergize with both. Strength is easily buffed, but important. The low Cha is covered by using spells that have no save. Caster level- With Martial arcanist, my caster level in warmage is 10 and with practiced spellcaster my duskblade caster level is 9! Spells Part 1- Both are spontaneous casters. Spontaneous meaning that a spell slot of a given level can be used to cast any spell known of that level. Duskblades have a small spells known list, bu this is made up for by the larger list of the Warmage. Pick your Duskblade spells to avoid overlap, prioritize the swift casting times or the ones that are restricted to Duskblades. Many of the Warmage's spells can significantly increase melee combat ability. Spell Channelling- A Duskblade can channel any touch spell he knows (including Warmage) with no Att of Opp. A Warmage gets his Int bonus added to damage only on Warmage spells. So if you cast a warmage touch spell it gets both abilities. Armored Mage- only works for the spell list of the class feature, work towards Abj Champs shield and Mage armor Weapon- Bastard sword appear to be the best. Hold it in 1 hand to perform somatic components, then grip with 2 hands to power attack after strength has been buffed! Damage over time- Warmage gets extra edge on each damage spell 1/round.

The entire battle took approximately 3.5 hours and that just felt entirely too long. I asked the DM what the average level of the enemies we were facing and he said level 5, that was very discouraging. Outside of the battles we manage decent pace through the material.

Tends to partner up with either the Avenger or the Barbarian) * At-Will: Gloaming Cut, Sly Flourish, Agile Recovery, Fast Hands, * Encounter: Torturous Strike, Bait and Switch, Rogue's Luck, Knack for Success * Daily: Trick Strike, Deep Cut &amp;nbsp; Psion, lvl 7 (Stays as far away as possible and just places Force Shards or Psychic Anomolies. That's it. Keep reading these guys are supposed to be crazy powerful, uh... not so much. Used to team up with the Avenger and they would manipulate enemies into position to get hit my the Force Shards &amp; Pyschic Anomolies, but it was seriously limiting the Avenger's effectiveness as we went up in levels) * At-Will: Force Shard, Psychic Anomaly, Kintectic Buffer * Encounter: Far Hand, Forceful Push, User Vulnerability, Natural Terrain Understanding, Bastion of Mental Clarity * Daily:Ravening Thought, Telekinetic Maul, Telekenitic Lift &amp;nbsp; Warlock (Binder), lvl 7 (Usually lurks in the shadows and tries to hinder enemies from a distance but doesn't seem to do much damage.)

Fairy Base Speed - 30ft Fey - Recieves advantage on saving throws ( Int, Wis, Cha ) against spells specifically directed at the character and cannot be put to sleep via magical means. Vulnerability to Iron - Damage sustained from iron weapons do an additional 2 damage ( or maybe 1d4? ). Cannot touch iron with bare skin without being burned ( say 1 fire damage if in contact with it for a turn or have specifically chosen to interact with something iron ) though this can be overcome by having a barrier between the skin and the iron, for example: a glove. Speak with Beasts - Through basic sounds and gestures you can communicate basic ideas to beasts, though this does nothing to affect their hostility towards you. Subraces ( Thank you Trabian for the great ideas ). Satyr - Dex +2 ( or maybe Wis +2 ), Con +1. Base speed increases by 10ft. Disadvantage on all climb checks and when climbing, base speed is treated as if it were 30ft ( max 15ft climbed ). Bonus proficiency - Flute Troll / Ogre - Con +2, Str +1. Natural Armor = 12+Dex Mod. A strong and big frame give advantage on strength checks and change unarmed damage from a d4 to a d6, but you receive disadvantage on sleight of hand and stealth checks. Once a day can shrug off the effects of iron vulnerability for one minute, but once this expires, receive 1 damage for every time you've been stuck with something iron. ( Since this seems to be more of a melee subrace I wanted to give them something to survive in close quarters better but is this too extreme? ) Sidhe - ( Cha or Int +2, I'm not sure which makes most sense thematically here ), Dex +1. Glamour - You know the Friends cantrip. At third level, you can cast the Charm Person spell once per day. At fifth level, you can also cast the Suggestion spell once per day. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these skills. ( Drows get a cantrip, a first level spell, and a second level spell, does this seem a bit much here? ) Pixie / Sprite - Dex +2, Cha +1. Small size. Base speed = 25ft. Wings - Gain perfect flight at a speed of 40ft, but if you attempt to do anything but hover with these wings, you may only stay aloft for a total of two rounds. You may use dash to double your total flight distance, but doing so leaves you exhausted and unable to use your wings for two rounds. If you only dash one round, your recovery time is reduced to one round once you land. You are forced to land upon sustaining any damage. How does this sound in its current form? I agree with the below comments that straight up iron vulnerability is probably too extreme, so I scaled it down a bit. Do you think this would be better off by just removing that aspect and coming up with a different negative trait, if so what would be a good one in your opinion? Again, thank you all for giving me such good advice on how to make this work! "

393,vulnerability,DnD,Homebrew Race - Briari. Need assistance balancing one racial.,5,42x1jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/42x1jg/homebrew_race_briari_need_assistance_balancing/,2016-01-27 22:17:36,"Hello /r/dnd! My friend suggested a homebrew race of tree/plant-like humanoid race. He added some racial abilities but they were very vague, OP or didn't fit in the 5e mechanics very well (like scaling AC with proficiency bonus or a bonus depending on level). One of the interesting racials would be ability he called Blossom which was in fact a once-per-long-rest rapid regeneration. I tried redesigning it into something like this: **Spread roots:** As an action you grow roots from your feet into the ground and drain nutrients from the nature around you, rapidly restoring your health. For 1 minute your speed becomes 0 and you automaticaly fail Dexterity saving throws. Your AC also doesn't get the Dex bonus. Every round you restore 1d4 health, you can end this early as a bonus action. You can use this ability once per long rest. Any suggestions on how I can change this? Or does it seem balanced? Maybe I should add concentration? Thanks for any suggestion in advance! EDIT: Adding info on Briari race ***Briari*** **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 2. **Damage Vulnerability.** You have Vulnerability to fire damage. **Living Armor.** When you are not wearing armor, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. During a short rest, you can bond a suit of armor you are wearing to your body. When you finish that short rest, the armor you are wearing is bonded to you, and it cannot subsequently be removed from your body until you finish another short rest during which time you remove the bonded armor. **One with nature.** When you are resting in forests, swamps or other places near earth and plants you need only 4 hours of sleep, otherwise you need 8. **Natural Light.** You can produce natural light from glowing points on your body as an action. This creates bright light in a 20 foot radius around you, and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The color of the light is determined by your subrace. You can stop producing the light as an action. *Subraces* &gt;Duran (red\orange) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1. * **Toughness.** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 every time you gain a level. &gt;Vinethar (dark-blue, blue-green) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score increases by 1. * **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 35 feet * **Mask of the wild.** You can attempt to hide even when you are lightly obscured in foliage, mist, heavy rain and other natural phenomenon. &gt;Brightli (liliac) * **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom or Charisma score increases by 1. * **Innate Magic.** You know the *Druifcraft* cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the *Entangle* spell once per day. When you reach 5th level, you can also cast the *Spike Growth* spell once per day. Wisdom or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. The fire vulnerability is still up in the air for me, as it is the worst vulnerability you can have. But removing it would make this race a bit more powerful comparing to default races. "

On Saturday night, I was running the finale of my campaign with a decent sized group of level 1 adventurers (it's a simplified homebrew editioned, based on this website: [SimpleD&amp;D](URL ). The final boss for this adventure was a pirate captain, who was secretly a werewolf. Well, I say secret, but her name was Howelwelle and the party's fighter guessed it after the first session. Anyway, there they were, face to face with her once again-- and this time, things were a little stacked in her favor. The clouds part, the full moon is shown, and the fight begins. After a lot of vicious attacks and expert dodges, the gang started to realize that they could only kill the beast with magical or silver weapons. The cleric was bereft of any of these attacks, sparing the reverse of cure minor wounds. As he ended his turn, he told me that he readied a small object in his hand-- and insisted that I wait until it was revealed to know what it was. With his free action, he called out at the werewolf and gained its attention. *Important Background, this Draconian Cleric is obsessed with spoons. He's collected several, and throughout the whole campaign he was desperate to find a stash of his favorite eating utensil. Feeling a touch sorry for him in every mess hall he looted, I offered him the occasional spoon as loot. Unfortunately, I hadn't taken note of one of the spoons I gave him, and I was dumbfounded when I realized what I had done.* So, the Werewolf's turn comes, and it charges at him with bloodlust. It knocks aside the necromancer, and lunges at him with an attack that was sure to kill him. The cleric stretched his arm out to meet its mouth, and there it was-- *the Sterling Silver spoon.* He held his hand outwards, and the werewolf consumed his arm whole, dealing three times the damage his character should have been able to withstand. I thought, though-- *that's clever, I'll admit. I'll give him his death saves, maybe he'll just go into shock and die next turn from the blood loss.* He survived on his first throw, and collapsed in a bloody mess. The wolf choked, seized, and lost a turn, while the other cleric rushed to his aid. The werewolf was subsequently slain in its moment of vulnerability, and the one armed draconian walked away with a tied up stump. He traded in his staff for a mace, and he's left with a stump that ends past the still-moving shoulder. I've wondered, since he can't use piercing weapons, what interesting alternatives to the hook-hand cliche can I conjur up? I'd love some fellow players' thoughts!"

The older ones, especially, are inscrutable as sphinxes. Predictable only in their unpredictability. The ancient ones, out of time and space, are among if not the most powerful and oldest beings known to the planes, feared by the gods themselves. Their motivations are unknowable, inconceivable. . . Be me, Hirgunthur, a wannabe warlock. Sell your soul to a pit fiend, later realize your error error. Try to get out of the deal. Travel to Acheron to retrieve your soul. Miraculously, you do. This act alone makes you a legend - one of the very, *very* few mortals to ever regain possession of their soul once their pact was struck. Understand your vulnerability and the fate which awaits you should the pit fiend reclaim reclaim you. Panic. Arrange a second pact with a powerful Fey.

Eberron). My friends have been clamoring for a new campaign with the advent of 5th and one of them getting the DMG, PHB, and Monster Manuel for his wedding gift (from me and my girlfriend no less, haha). In other words, I need to prepare a game. I've decided I'm going to create my own world for the campaign, because I have an idea for a fun campaign that would be a lot different from what they've played. And, I'm a little burned out on campaign settings. My concept is that I want to turn Grimm's fair tales on their head. I want these tales we all know to look differently in a DnD sense. For instance, Little Red Riding Hood would be a lycanthrope or whatnot. The plot concept I have is that the land is ruled by seven princesses who are essentially immortal and all powerful from a political perspective. They've ruled their respective countries fairly, yet, harshly. At the start of the campaign one of the princesses was put into a magical sleep which essentially creates a power vacuum. With there being a vulnerability to the ever powerful princesses, a rebellion rises up to overthrow them. When the players start out they're recruited by a powerful necromancer named the ""puppeteer"" who has lost his golem, one who inadvertently gained sentience. The theme is at what point do people get the chance to rule themselves, and can power actually corrupt even the best meaning individual. I've told the players they are not allowed to play lawful good characters. Now, how deep should I go into preparations. Do I need population numbers for every town? Their economies? Religions? Histories? When I start this, what do I need to have solidified before starting? I want to make sure I'm well prepared and versed in my world."

For example: A Tiefling Monk 10 with 70 HP (resistant to fire, immune to poison) is transformed into a twig blight with 4 HP (vulnerable to fire) by True Polymorph; the next round, the polymorphed twig blight gets poisoned and takes 70 fire damage before applying vulnerability. How much excess damage carries over to the Tiefling form after the twig blight form is reduced to 0 HP? Would it take the full 136 excess damage ((70x2)-4); resist the excess fire damage for 68 damage; or would the blight form be reduced to 0 HP by 2 points of the initial fire damage being doubled to 4, and the tiefling form take 34 points of damage from resisting the excess 68 points of fire damage? Additionally, would the poisoned condition be removed upon the tiefling monk regaining immunity to poison? Are there any rules that specifically cover this kind of damage and condition carry-over, or are situations of gaining/losing resistance and immunity something Wizards left to DM's discretion because they would be so uncommon?"

Through my adventure I've come to love constructs and would love to make a race as such but is currently having a hard time balancing it. Hope you guys can help out and together we can make an awesome race :). **Physical properties:** * Type: Construct * Low-light vision * Darkvision 60ft * Immunity to all mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms and patterns). * Immunity to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects and necromancy effects. * Cannot heal damage as a construct does not have normal HP, must be repaired instead with repair spells (CA) or through the use of the ""craft construct"" feat or craft: armorsmithing skill. * Not subject to non-lethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue, or exhaustion. * Immunity to any effect that requires a Fortitude save (unless the effect also works on objects, or is harmless). * Not at risk of death being knocked unconscious from massive damage. * Immediately destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points or less. * Since it was never alive, a construct cannot be raised or resurrected, but can be put back together and revived with an electric surge, unless sustained too severe damage (fx melted). * Constructs do not eat, sleep, or breathe. * Mechanoids don't need to make intelligence checks to remember something. They have perfect eidetic memory. * Cannot swim due to the great mass, they sink like stones. **Stats:** * No constitution score as this is based solely on build parts * Weight: (137 kg) / meter in height. * Mechanoids have a +5 racial bonus to craft: armorsmithing and knowledge (architecture and engineering). * Fire resistance 10, Cold resistance 5, Immunity to Sonic attacks. * Vulnerability to Acid (+50% damage from acid attacks). * Electricity injury - If a Mechanoid takes electricity damage, it must make a fortitude save DC 10 + electricity damage dealt or be dazed for one round. * Speed: 20ft * Natural armor +3 * Abilities: Str +4, Con -, Cha -3.

I've had a great time playing a bunch of different campaigns with my friends in the last year from HotDQ, a custom Elder Scrolls campaign, and my new custom campaign with a large amount of homebrew and emphasis on storytelling and improv opposed to set goals and powergaming. Recently my friend has come up with the idea of building homebrew classes, one of which we've built up to level 5. I know a lot of people have put there stuff on here before and I know that you guys would have a lot of useful insight on how to make the class more fun or balanced. I'm typing this all shorthand and from memory so forgive me if it's a little sloppy. So here goes: * d8s for health **Proficiencies**: * Dex and Int saves * Simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars, longswords, rapiers, light armor * Skills: choose 3 from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Sleight of hand, History, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Intimidation * Tools: One gaming set of your choice **Starting equipment**: * A rapier or longsword * Two shortswords or 20 darts * Explorer's or dungeoneer's pack * Two daggers * Leather armor or a gaming set of your choice **Level 1**: * Unarmored defense equal to 10 + Dex mod + Int mod * *Fighting Style (choose one:)* * Defense * Dueling * Two-weapon fighting * Blade focus (+2 to attacks with longsword attacks when wielded in two hands, and longswords are finesse weapons for you) **Level 2**: * Ki point equivalent called Adrenaline points (AP), 1 per level, regaining after short or long rest. Saves if applicable will be based on 8 + Int mod + proficiency bonus. *Every myrmidon at level 2 gets*: * Patient Defense: 1AP, dodge as a bonus action. * Sure strike: 1AP, advantage on attacks until the end of your turn **Archetype choice**: *Way of Bloodletting*: * (Currently unnamed): On an attack roll of 19 (nat), you may use 1AP to make that attack a critical hit. (Increased to 18 at ? level) or, *Way of Devotion*: * (Currently unnamed): When an enemy within 5 feet of you makes an attack against you and misses, you may spend 1AP to make a melee attack against them as a reaction. **Level 3** * Swordmaster: When you land an attack with a longsword, rapier, shortsword, or dagger, you may spend 2AP to roll an additional damage die of the weapon's type. **Level 4**: ASI **Level 5**: * Extra attack * (Currently unnamed): 1AP to use a dash as a bonus action, and opportunity attacks have disadvantage against you until the end of your turn. So that's all I've got so far. I do have some ideas for higher levels including proficiency in con or wis saves for bloodletter and devotion respectively at level 6, including some other feature. Evasion at 7 and... that's about all I have in mind until later levels. I'm imagining the level 20 feature will be a regaining of X AP at initiative rolls. And I'm thinking of the level 17 feature being something like vulnerability to slashing damage for a target at a cost of some AP or two attacks as a bonus action for some AP for bloodletter and devotion as well. Any ideas or comments are greatly appreciated!"

Although we're all RL friends, the DM rents a room from the Ranger, basically making the Ranger the DM's landlord. You probably see where this is going. I was really excited to play so I bought and studied the PHB, learned the terms (I never thought I would need to know what an outer plane is...now I do.), bought dice and basically ate up everything I could about D&amp;D. I decided to play as a Vengeance Paladin with the (not so original) backstory about avenging my dead parents and stopping evil across the land. We start our first session and find out that the Ranger has unlimited arrows. Totally 100% unlimited for no apparent reason other than, as the Ranger said ""I shouldn't have to buy them."" Oh, and the Ranger is also a 'Werebear"". Which means at lvl 1 they can turn into an intelligent Bear at will, with 40 hit points and claws that do 2d6 damage and attack twice. Yes - a bear with double attacking Greatswords for arms. We begin our adventure and are tasked with clearing a group of gnolls from a nearby town, so we journey there and are attacked by a few of them along the way. Despite rolling in the middle of the group for initiative, I a told that the first gnoll jumps from a tree and lands on me, pinning me down. There were no dice rolls involved in this move at all, just something that happened. We manage to kill the gnolls, during which the Ranger (Who didn't 'Bear out', but was allowed to shoot through the head of one gnoll, into the face of another, then follow that up with another arrow, splintering the first one and killing the gnoll to the side. All in one turn.) would scream ""That's ONE FOR ME!"" every time they dropped a gnoll. We arrive in the town and are immediately set upon by a couple gnolls. I manage a 20 for initiative so I draw my sword and start attacking, as soon as I make my first attack we're 'surprised' by 6 more gnolls. All of which take their moves before the rest of the party and attack me. I go down fast. Ranger saves the day by climbing a tree - no rolls, just does it- and shooting the gnolls from above. Because they are in the tree they ""have the highground"" and get advantage on every attack. Over the next few sessions we clear the town, during which we find a ""+2 to damage Bow"" randomly laying in the sewer. Literally. This obviously goes to the Ranger, because clearly if you have unlimited arrows you clearly need a magic sewer bow. By the end of our forth session we've cleared the town and found a cave that led us down to a dungeon. In the dungeon we kill even more gnolls; the cleric finds a mace that lets him cast a free 1d10 heal once a day, the wizard finds a wand of yet undetermined power but ""it glows with arcane power"", and I found 10 gold pieces. I feel rich... We reach the end of the dungeon and find a crypt littered with bones. I'm thinking, ""Finally! Some undead skeletons so I have a chance to shine!"" I cast Divine Sense, which reads: *Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.* The DM tells me I detect nothing. I roleplay to the party that the bones pose no threat so we head in. The bones come to life as a group of skeletons. I ask the DM why I didn't detect them and she tells me ""They weren't evil at the time, they were just bones. Now they are evil."" I'm also told that the ones attacking me have advantage because I walked into the area without caution - because I didn't detect any evil. Even though I'm new to D&amp;D I know it's a bad idea to quote the PHB to the DM, so I ask ""Am I misunderstanding how Divine Sense works?"" She tells me ""No, it just works different in my game."" I'm pretty sure that's her saying ""It doesn't work."" We clear the skeletons and make our way to the last chamber, which contains a big bad guy and two smaller bad guys. We attack, one of the smaller bad guys hits me, with an AC of 16 and a shield for all but 1 of my hit points. The flavor from the DM is that I'm impaled against the wall, my organs are basically falling out of the wound. The next small bad guy attacks the Ranger, who has at this point an AC of 14. The bad guy pushes the Ranger against the wall, making them drop their dagger. No damage. Zero. I use my Lay on Hands and the Cleric heals me in time to face the Big Bad guy. He's a giant Skelton, and I haven't used a smite yet, so I'm excited. I don't bother using Divine Sense, because it clearly wont do anything for me. I attack using a bludgeoning weapon and ask if I get the double damage for vulnerability. Nope. I see where this is going, I still smite and ask if I get to use the extra 1d8 against undead. Nope. I ask, ""Isn't it a skeleton? Aren't those undead?"" I'm told, ""Maybe, maybe not."" We kill it, and low and behold it drops a shiny new polearm! I'm the only character that is pure melee and I use two-handed weapons, and I had mentioned that I was probably going to get Polearm Master. I pick it up...and...it's made of rust, and crumbles in my hands. So, am I being overly sensitive? Is my DM out of her mind, just making things up? I would really love to hear what you all advise. The people I'm playing with are all friends of mine, but we're all feeling like the game is quite unbalanced. Also, sorry that my first reddit post *ever* is so long! tl/dr: DM is just inventing things for one player, I'ma punching bag, there's a Werebear and a magical sewer bow. "

By accepting this particular circle as your destiny, you can no longer Wild Shape. However, you choose a lycanthrope base form and change your type to Shapechanger. You do not gain the ability score increases or resistances of other, more savage, lycanthropes but you do retain their attacks (include pounce, maul, bite and claw attacks). Your form of lycanthropy is not infectious. You can use your action to polymorph into your beast or hybrid form, or back into your true form, which is humanoid. When you are transformed into your beast or hybrid form the following rules apply:  All of your forms share the same hit point pool, unlike Wild Shape.  Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creatures bonus instead of yours.  While in your beast form you cant cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesnt break your concentration on a spell youve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that youve already cast. Your hybrid form does not have this restriction.  You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you cant use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your beast form also has that sense.  Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isnt transformed.  When you die, you revert to your true form. Silver Vulnerability: You take double damage from silvered weapons and cannot wield them. Additionally, physical contact with silver causes you great pain. **4th Level (Replaces Wild Shape Improvement):** Choose one below (O) Wild Flexibility: Attack and damage rolls for your natural weapons are based on whichever is higher of your Strength and Dexterity. (D) Natural Resilience: You gain resistance to Poison damage. (U) Keen Senses: You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that involve hearing or smell. **6th Level:** Unarmored Defense: While not wearing any armor or using a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. **8th Level (Replaces Wild Shape Improvement):** Choose one below (O) The Hunter: You gain a +1 to attack when using your natural weapons in your beast form. (D) The Stalker: You gain proficiency in the Stealth skill. (U) The Warden: The spell Animal Friendship is now always prepared for you. **10th Level:** Extra Attack: Beginning at 10th level, you can attack twice instead of once, whenever you take the attack action on your turn using your natural weapons. **14th Level:** Tongue of the Wild: Your close connection to nature allows you to speak with animals at will like the spell, in addition, you may speak in your animal form as if you were in your true form (but this does not allow you to cast spells until you are 18th level). **20th Level (replaces Archdruid):** Beast Blood: As an action, you can call upon the power of your lycanthrope blood and grant yourself a portion of their resistances. For 1 minute, you gain resistance to nonmagical weapons that are not silvered. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. "

(Maybe word this better to let the 'vampire race' Vryloka in, but keep the rest of the undead out?) --- **Vampire Starting Feature (1st level):** You are an undead creature. You are unaffected by anything that affects only living creatures. You dont need to eat, drink, or breathe, and you dont age. Also, you have resist 5 necrotic and vulnerable 5 radiant. If you end your turn in direct sunlight and lack a protective covering such as a cloak, you take 5 radiant damage (plus additional damage from your radiant vulnerability) from the sunlight, and you are weakened until you find shade. If you drop below 1 hit point from this damage, you are instantly destroyed. In addition, you gain the **Scent of Blood (Vampire)** power.

You then move up to your speed -2, ignoring the usual penalty to stealth for moving over 2 squares. --- **Vampiric Reserves - Vampire Utility 6** Encounter - Shadow No action - Personal **Trigger:** You make a saving throw. **Effect:** You roll twice and use the higher result. --- **Gaseous Form - Vampire Utility 10** Daily - Shadow, Polymorph Minor Action - Personal **Effect:** You assume a gaseous form. While in this form, you are insubstantial and phasing, gain a fly speed equal to your land speed, and gain a +5 power bonus to Stealth checks. You cannot attack in this form. The form lasts until the end of your next turn or until you use a free action to end it. **Sustain Minor:** The gaseous form persists until the end of your next turn. **Special:** If you entered the form outside of combat and took no damage before ending it, you regain its use."

406,vulnerability,DnD,[HOMEBREW][5e] I need some help trying to balance out a homebrew race i made. Would you guys mind reading it and giving me some advice on what to change?,0,3ps260,https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3ps260/homebrew5e_i_need_some_help_trying_to_balance_out/,2015-10-23 01:47:58,"So i made a homebrew race, and am pretty proud i was able to do so, but i'm going to start a session with some friends soon and wanted to throw my race into the world. However, i don't trust just my judgement on how balanced the race is. So i was hoping you guys could help. I'm going to post the traits below (probably going to be really long). I took out all the fluff and just put the numbers and such below. ~~The one i am looking for the most help on is the third subrace, which i tried to draw inspiration from the wraith and doppelganger. I realize i went really overboard with it and i want to know how to balance it properly.~~ If you do take the time to read all this and help me out, thank you very much. Base **Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1 **Age.** The construct of a Wraigdus provides it long life spans, sometimes to age 100. They mature at a slightly accelerated rate compared to humans, and during the later years of their life the construct bodies they inhabit start to deteriorate, resulting in a lowering of strength and overall physical ability. Sometime around the last 5 years of life, the construct nearly shuts down completely, allowing only for slow movements, and slow speaking. **Alignment.** Wraigdus tend to be very neutral, whether it is good or evil. **Size.** Wraigdus stand between 6 and 8 feet tall, and average around 250 pounds. Your size is medium. **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 25 feet. **Darkvision.** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. **Living Construct.** Even though you were constructed, you are a living creature, and the construct itself still requires some of the necessities that regular bodies do. You are resistant to nonmagic diseases. You do not need water to survive, and do not require food as regularly as other races. Instead of sleeping, you enter an inactive state for 4 hours each day. You do not dream in this state; you completely shut down, and are unaware of any events occurring around you. **Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of the attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and Wraigin **Subrace.** Four main subraces of Wraigdus populate the worlds of D&amp;D: Brutes, Proteans, Morphers, and Wraithic Brutes (meant to be tanks, fighters) **Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score increases by 1. **Savage Attacks.** When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapons damage dice on additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit **Animalistic Strength.** You are proficient with unarmed strikes, which deal 1d4 damage on a strike. Protean (meant to be intelligent, wise, spellcasters, etc) **Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score increases by 1. **Higher Shade Authority.** You know the Blade Ward cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the Chromatic Orb spell once a day. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells **Electrical Vulnerability.** Electric attacks and spells have Advantage against you Morpher (meant to be stealthy, spies, disguise, not a lot of HP) **Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score increases by 1 **Disguise Ability** You know the ""Disguise self"" spell, and can use it at will. Wraithic (Dexterous, fast) **Ability Score Increase** Your Dexterity score increases by 1 **Wraithic Slash** You can use your action to slash in an arc 10 ft across, reaching 5 ft in front of you. When you use your Wraithic Slash, each creature in the area of the attack must make a saving throw. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level. After you use the Wraithic Slash ability, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest. Again, thanks for the help. Edit:Formatting Edit 2: Removed the Ability Score penalties, changed disease immunity to resistance to nonmagical diseases. changed animalistic strength from 1d6 to 1d4, removed the ""rider"" as it was called from the Wraithic touch ability, along with the added 1d6 for each level, and made it to where subraces only receive 1 ablility score increase. Edit 3: Removed Ambusher, Wraithic touch, and magic weapons from Mutant. Edit 4: Broke up Mutant subrace into two seperate subraces. Removed Wraithic reach, read thoughts, and Shapechanger. Also removed sunlight sensitivity, aversions, and magic vulnerability. Edit 5: Lowered speed to 25, removed elemental resistance, changed the electrical vulnerability to a disadvantage instead, caused construct deterioration at higher ages, removed the ability to not need breathing, and added a requirement of eating, changed the spells for Protean subraces from 2 spells and one cantrip to one spell and one cantrip, changed the spell from darkness to chromatic orb, lowered maximum age, changed to a full shutdown when resting, and lowered ability score modifier for base from 2 to 1."

I also wanted to build some of the classes of the game in order to really provide more routes for players. So here is my Shaman build. You are the first to look at it besides me, so please, tear it apart. I've done what I could with it, now I need a few extra eyes. When we've toned it down, I'll post a finished product with flavor and all that jazz, like a chapter straight out of the PHB, but for now, lets just look at the mechanics. **Shaman** Level | Prof Bonus | Features | Cantrips Known | Spell Slots per Level :--:|:--:|:--|:--:|:--: 1st | +2 | Spellcasting, Spirit Recovery | 3 | 2 / - / - / - / - / - / - / - /- 2nd | +2 | Spirit Path | 3 | 3 / - / - / - / - / - / - / - / - 3rd | +2 | - | 3 | 4 / 2 / - / - / - / - / - / - / - 4th | +2 | Ability Score Improvement | 4 | 4 / 3 / - / - / - / - / - / - / - 5th | +3 | - | 4 | 4 / 3 / 2 / - / - / - / - / - / - 6th | +3 | Spirit Path Feature | 4 | 4 / 3 / 3 / - / - / - / - / - / - 7th | +3 | - | 4 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 1 / - / - / - / - / - 8th | +3 | Ability Score Improvement | 4 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 2 / - / - / - / - / - 9th | +4 | - | 4 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 1 / - / - / - / - 10th | +4 | Spirit Recovery (2/day), Spirit Path Feature | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / - / - / - / - 11th | +4 | - | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / - / - / - 12th | +4 | Spirit Lore, Ability Score Improvement | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / - / - / - 13th | +5 | - | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / - / - 14th | +5 | Spirit Path Feature | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / - / - 15th | +5 | - | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1 / - 16th | +5 | Ability Score Improvement | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1 / - 17th | +6 | - | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 18th | +6 | - | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1 19th | +6 | Ability Score Improvement | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 1 / 1 / 1 20th | +6 | Spirit Recovery (x1d4) | 5 | 4 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 2 / 2 / 1 / 1 **Shaman Features** **Hit Points** * *Hit Dice:* 1d8 per druid level **Proficiencies** * *Armor:* Light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. * *Weapons:* Clubs, daggers, great clubs, light hammers, maces, quarterstaffs, spears, flails, mauls, morning stars, pikes, rapiers, short swords, tridents, war picks, and warhammers. * *Tools:* None. * *Saving Throws:* Wisdom, Constitution. * *Skills:* Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Insight, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Religion, and Survival. **Spellcasting** Drawing on the essence of the spiritual world, you can cast spells to shape the will of the spirits. ***Cantrips*** At 1st level, you know 3 cantrips of your choice from the shaman spell list. You learn additional shaman cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Shaman table. ***Preparing and Casting Spells*** You prepare the list of shaman spells that are avaliable for you to cast, choosing from the shaman spell list. When you do so, choose a number of shaman spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your shaman level. You regain your expended spell slots back after a long rest. ***Spellcasting Ability*** * *Spell save DC=8+your proficiency bonus+your Wisdom modifier* * *Spell attack modifier=your proficiency bonus+your Wisdom modifier* ***Ritual Casting*** You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag. ***Spellcasting focus*** You can use a shaman focus as a spellcasting focus for your shaman spells. I haven't come up with specifics, but it will be similar in price to druidic focus. **Spirit Recovery** You've forged a pact with spirits who feed off your own life force, in return providing the shaman with more magical power. Once per day, you may summon hungry spirits as a free action. The spirits feed from your life force for 1 round, dealing damage equal to your shaman class level + Wisdom Modifier. Tiny welts, bruises, and lacerations begin to appear on your body, although this process is painful, you have inured yourself to such pain and do not have to make Concentration checks to continue casting spells due to the damage caused by the hungry spirits. At the beginning of your turn on the following round, you regain a number of spell slots equaling half your shaman level, minimum 1. The life force drained by the hungry spirits cannot be healed before taking a long rest, even by magical means. At level 10, you can use this feature twice per long rest. At level 20, you roll 1d4 causing you to multiply the damage caused by this feature by the number shown on the dice. If the number shown is a 3 or a 4, regain your level in spell slots. **Spirit Path** At 2nd level, you choose to follow a specific spirit path: Spirit of the Mystic, Spirit of the Herd, Spirit of the Hunt, Spirit of the Elder, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level. **Ability Score Improvement** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Spirit Lore** Starting at 12th level, you have learned secret lore from the spirits, granting you a bonus feat. You must meet all of the feat's usual requirements. **Spirit Paths** **Spirit of the Mystic** * *Mystic Touch* Starting at 2nd level, you have been gifted a deadly touch from the mystical spirits. After solely observing a creature for 3 rounds without casting any spells or doing anything requiring concentration, your next successful melee hit against the creature is a critical. * *Misty Escape* Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60ft to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. * *Land's Stride* Starting at 10th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell. * *Mystic Magic* Starting at 14th level, your Mystic Touch will also deal critical damage when you successfully attack with a spell rather than with a melee attack. ***Mystic Spells*** Your mystical connection to the spirit world infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level you gain access to spells provided to you by the spirits of the mystic. Once you gain access to a spell provided on the list, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the shaman spell list, the spell is nonetheless a shaman spell for you. Shaman Level | Spirit Path Spells :--:|:-- 2nd | *Expedious Retreat, Hellish Rebuke* 3rd | *Misty Step, Invisibility* 5th | *Gaseous Form, Vampiric Touch* 7th | *Greater Invisibility, Dimension Door* 9th | *Passwall, Tree Stride* **Spirit of the Herd** * *Spirit Aura* Starting at 2nd level, the range of spells that target several allies is doubled. * *Totem Spirit* Starting at 6th level, you may choose one of the spells provided to you by this path that has a duration that requires concentration.

You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it, you must be proficient with its form. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your spirit weapon disappears after 1 minute unless you attack with it every turn after the 10 rounds. You can dismiss the spirit weapon, no action required, when you choose. You can use this feature once per short rest. * *Elemental Weapon* Starting at level 6, when you create your spirit weapon you can choose to imbue your weapon with elemental energy. Choosing from acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder. You weapon now does 1d6 additional damage, this additional damage is of the energy from your choosing. This counts as the energy type when overcoming resistance or vulnerability to the elemental energy. * *Spiritual Enhancement* Starting at level 10, when you choose to imbue your weapon with an elemental energy your weapon truly becomes a weapon of energy. * When hit with an acid weapon, the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw against a save DC equal to your shaman level. If the target failed, the target takes an additional 1d6 on its next turn. * When hit with a cold weapon, the targets speed is reduced by 10 feet until its next turn. * When hit with a fire weapon, the target takes an additional 1d8 damage rather than the initial 1d6 given from the Elemental Weapon feature.

In addition you have advantage on any target wearing armor made of metal. * When hit with a thunder weapon, the target must succeed a Strength saving throw of a DC of your shaman level or be pushed 10 feet away from you. * *Weapon of the Hunt* Starting at level 14, once conjured your spirit weapon does not disappear until you've dismissed it. **Hunt Spells** Your connection to the spirit world infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.

Have I understood the rules correct in how i interprit them? Second question: Damage resistance: In the PHB p197 ""Resistance and then vulnerability are applied afterall other modifiers to damage."" Example: If you then have an arrow with fire damage, do you half ALL damage, including the piercing, or only the fire damage? Could not find that example in the PHB"
409,vulnerability,DnD,Just Had Our Best Session Yet.,0,3fky9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3fky9t/just_had_our_best_session_yet/,2015-08-03 14:00:45,"So I'm currently DM'ing a 5e game (first time DM'ing) in a custom universe. All of the Gods are celebrities and I have a story reason for throwing pretty much anything into the world (Font of Souls from which things/people from any universe can be drawn). So far the party has done stuff like fight NorthernLion as a boss and explore the abandoned settlement Boatmurdered from Dwarf Fortress. But tonight something more magical than I could of hoped for happened. Here are our beautiful PCs (We have 2 more but they couldn't make it). * Thomas Jerome Newton - Human Sorcerer - Owner of the finest brothel in Suffragette City (the city the party is currently in) and known partier. He is immune to the effects of cocaine. He has a manservant name Furry Yiffsgerald, a Khajiit (I made them a race for the hell of it) whom he purchased from a pet store in a previous session. Yiffsgerald is dumb as a rock but has incredibly high charisma and an impeccable body. * Hasdrabul the Despoiler - Tiefling Bard - A high missionary in the priesthood of David Bowie, he is currently on a quest to find the long lost Codpiece of Bowie. He has a turntable as his instrument. * Marcus Aurelius - Elf Rogue/Fighter - Our resident conspiracy theorist, he is from a minor noble house and believes that all the gods with the exception of Bowie are actually space aliens, and has on several occasions grilled party members and NPCs about such. * John Token - Halfing Druid - Probably the most ""custom"" character, he is a mysterious figure who most of the time doesn't make sense. All of his attacks/spells are weed related, and his magic joints cause the smoker to heal, but also roll a D10000 from Orrex's expanded Wild Surge list. This usually leads to the most chaos in battles. The party was in Suffragette City in order to steal the Declaration of Independence from the vaults of the castle for Nicolas Cage, God of Vampires. To do this they were told to travel through the undercity where a passage had been made to get into the castles basements and infiltrate a party, and then steal away into the castle vaults when the time was right. I had planned for 3 encounters between the start and getting to the vault. In the undercity the party discovered a group of 2 intellect devourers, 2 mind-controlled bandits and a spectator. The fight began with the rogue severely weakening one of the intellect devourers and then the druid casting smoke cloud on all of the enemies, causing them to roll from the wild magic list. They all rolled very poorly and one intellect devourer ended up finishing the other off with necrotic damage, and all of the enemies had a vulnerability to piercing damage. From there it looks like the PCs had already won but a series of unfortunate events made things much harder. The spectator landed several punishing attacks on the party and eventually Furry Yiffsgerald was knocking below 0 HP, making our sorcerer despondent. The rogue smoked a joint and through the wild magic chart because unable to bend any of his arm joints, making him useless in combat. He later pissed off a vampire who was trying to sleep in his coffin with his clumsiness. Eventually the party succeeded however, but not before the entire room had been filled with 3ft of cocaine, once again through wild magic. I only allowed a short rest, so most of them were pretty weak when they walked into the next encounter, 3 tough guards who had discovered the secret passage into the castle and were investigating. The sorcerer instructed Furry Yiffsgerald to seduce them, and he rolled a nat 20 on the performance check, gyrating them into submission with his dancing. One encounter avoided. The party then chugged their polyjuice potions and headed into the party disguised as the main cast of Seinfeld. Hilarity ensued as chips were double-dipped, there were awkward dances, and ""what's the deal with"" jokes were told. But soon it was time to sneak into the vault. The sorcerer instructed Furry Yiffsgerald to seduce the duke if at all possible and the party slunk away. I wanted this to be a boss encounter so I had the vault guarded by a red dragon wyrmling and 4 soldiers. There was also a series of fire traps activated by a lever on the other side of the room for the enemies to use. I had forgotten something critical, the druid spoke Draconic, and rolled a nat 20 on his persuasion check (I now nat 20s don't mean auto-successes on skill checks but I decided it would if what the PC suggested was at least faintly reasonable)...and then convinced the dragon to turn on the soldiers, turning a boss fight into a stomp as the dragon immediately immolated all 4 soldiers, and the party quickly made work of the survivors. Furry Yiffsgerald came back to the party holding a giant key he had stolen from the Duke, releasing the dragon; and once again he was instructed to seduce, but this time a dragon, pulling it off with a very high performance check. Our session ended as the bard played Sexual Healing on his turntable and the lights dimmed in the vault room. Though the party wriggled out of most of the trouble, I cannot lie, this was by far the most fun I've had DM'ing so far, because they went so off the rails I had to improvise most of it. Next session they will get to rob the vault and have to deal with a Khajiit/dragon romance. Who knows where its all going... "
410,vulnerability,DnD,"D&amp;D 5e, Working on a homebrew Lycanthrope race. Could use some feedback.",3,3g6f3n,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/3g6f3n/dd_5e_working_on_a_homebrew_lycanthrope_race/,2015-08-08 07:43:51,"This is a long post, so if you just want to see what I've come up with concerning the race, scroll down to the quoted bits. I know, I know, Lycanthropy is portrayed as a curse in 5th edition. Something that can be passed on from afflicted to afflicted, either by a bite or by being some poor sod's biological parent. Despite that, I felt compelled to put work into this. Not because I wanted to change the lore that we were presented with in 5e, but because, as a player character, your options concerning lycanthropy are extremely limited. As I understand it, your character can become a lycanthrope one of two ways. The first way is the ""intended"" way, as I've read, where one gets bitten by a werewolf and fails the constitution save to resist the curse. The second way to become a lycanthrope is to have the curse be passed on to your character genetically. I don't have a problem with either of these. What I *do* have a problem with is what you can do as a lycanthrope. A Lycanthrope can use its action to polymorph into a creature with a challenge rating of 4 (possibly 2 or 5) that is immune to three very common damage types. On top of that, a hybrid form can be chosen instead, allowing characters to still have access to their weapons. The downside? The DM can takes your character sheet and will play your lycanthrope as an NPC or enemy until the alignment change your character goes through is resolved. If you choose to embrace the curse, your alignment change may never resolve. I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of the current system. Yes, a skilled DM can just start pumping out baddies that use magical or silvered weaponry, but what a lot of people may not see is that lycanthropy was designed for NPCs. Magical and silvered weapons aren't going to do shit against your raging bear-totem barbarian lycanthrope because lycanthropy was designed to be the *sole thing* an enemy creature can do. Their entire shtick is that you can't hurt them with sticks and rocks. Furthermore, when a player is afflicted with lycanthropy, it's supposed to be a curse. *A bad thing.* Not a shortcut to immediate power. A lycanthrope runs the risk of blacking out and waking up with a belly full of friends, all at the hands of your DM. This is supposed to incentive players to find a cure. So, considering I really like the idea of lycanthropy on a player character, I went ahead and thought about what I could change. This is where I really started appreciating 5e's simplicity. Want to change a lycanthrope's damage immunities to resistances? Bam, done (but still too strong). Want to give them an actual vulnerability to silver? You can do that. However, the more I changed, the more I realized I was taking away from the poor enemy lycanthropes. Remember, that's their entire shtick. The can't use rage, they don't have action surges or Ki points to speak of, and I'm over here sending them to an early grave because of it. Those poor wee babies. From there, I had two options. I could homebrew a class focused around lycanthropy, much like a Circle of the Moon Druid without spells and only one wildshape. Or I could make a race. So I did that, using Shifters (the lycanthrope's closest in-game cousin) as a base. I'll add my explanation as to why I chose certain things in each area. &gt; **The Afflicted Traits** &gt; &gt; Lycanthropy is a curse that will travel down a family's bloodline until it solidifies as a way of life. Living in deception to prevent others from learning their true nature, the Afflicted are generally very anti-social and speak rarely more than two words at a time to strangers. After all, everybody's a potential snack. Fluff I'll probably refluff later. If anyone has a better description for the race, I'll take it. &gt; As an Afflicted, you have the following racial traits. &gt; &gt; ***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity increases by 1. Shifters gain one point in Dexterity and one point in another stat due to their subrace. The Afflicted gains one point in Dexterity and two more points in other stats based on their base race, a feature mentioned further down. &gt; ***Age.*** The Afflicted age the same as their base race, but don't usually live as long due to their short tempers and reckless behaviors. More fluff I'll accept being refluffed by anyone in the comments. &gt; ***Alignment.*** The Afflicted inherit a tendency towards chaos due to their inherent bloodlust and impulsive tendencies, but their true nature depends mostly on their upbringing. The ""do whatever you want"" cop-out at its finest. &gt; ***Size.*** Determined by your base race. *For now...* &gt; ***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is determined by your base race. I hope I don't need to explain this. &gt; ***Darkvision.*** Thanks to your lycanthropic blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.However, your lycanthropic blood strips you of the ability to see color in any light. Here we are, the first real mechanical change. You get darkvision at the cost of being color-blind (I know wolves can see some colors on the spectrum, but this is an interesting downside). I want this race to represent a balance struck between what you gain and what you lose as a lycanthrope. Unlike other races, which will focus on small gains with little to no losses, you'll be playing with some very solidified strengths and weaknesses. &gt; ***Menacing.*** You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill. Because you're a big fluffy spooky scary people-eater on the inside. &gt; ***Shapechanger.*** Once per long rest, as your action, you can transform into a Werewolf. This transformation lasts for 5 minutes (arbitrary time subject to change) or until you end it on your turn as an action. While transformed, you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your level + your Constitution bonus (minimum of 2). If wearing any armor, it falls off during the transformation. Your Strength becomes 15 if not higher, your speed becomes 40 feet if not higher, and your AC increases by 1. You also gain resistances to non-magical, non-silvered bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damages. During a full moon, you transform involuntarily until the full moon wanes. When the transformation ends, you suffer one level of exhaustion. Oh boy, here's the meat of the race. A mechanic that embodies both the gains and losses of being a lycanthrope. A lot of different thoughts went into this. Firstly, I should say that I wanted this race to be like a more defined Shifter. Stronger upsides, stronger downsides. That was my thought process behind all of this. Unlike a Shifter, your transformation takes a full action. You also gain more temporary hit points than a Shifter. Unlike an NPC lycanthrope, you only gain resistances to those common damage types, not immunities. Also unlike a RAW PC lycanthrope, your AC does not increase when you transform, though your Strength and movement speed still can. After the transformation, you suffer a level of exhaustion. That's a *massive* downside to this entire ability, as you can only get rid of that with a long rest. Thankfully, you won't be able to compound levels of exhaustions, as you won't be able to transform until after your next long rest anyway. Finally, a full moon does what a full moon should to any lycanthrope. This entire ability can be summed up as a big red button with the words ""emergency self-preservation"" written on it. You don't want to use it all willy-nilly every first encounter you get. (Side note: The Werewolf in the Monster Manual was used for this explanation, but any other form of were-beast can be used instead. The ability was actually balanced around the use of Werebears, as they appear to be the strongest lycanthropic creature in the Monster Manual.) &gt; ***Weakness.*** You are vulnerable to damage dealt by silvered weapons in all forms. Another downside to being a lycanthrope is that you and silver don't mix well together. Unlike an NPC lycanthrope, you have an actual *weakness* to the stuff; not just a lack of resistance. I've been contemplating this being a constant, and not stacking with resistances from outside sources, but I'll leave it as is for now. &gt; ***Relentless Endurance.*** When you are reduced to 0 hit points and not killed outright, you may drop to 1 hit point instead. Doing this uses your reaction to active Shapechanger. You can't use this feature if Shapechanger has already been used before a long rest. Taken from the Half-Orc. Why? I really like the idea of a lycanthrope who has to make the choice between revealing their true nature or keeping it hidden at the cost of their survival. If Shapechanger is the emergency survival button, this ability is the devil's advocate suggesting you give it a little push. If the race as a whole is percieved to be too strong, though, this is the first ability to go. The way I have it right now, a silver weapon renders this ability useless, but that may also change. &gt; ***Language.*** You can speak, read, and write Common, Sylvan, and another language based on your base race. Taken from the Shifter. &gt; ***Base Race.*** The Afflicted come in all shapes and sizes, and from many backgrounds. Choose one of the options below. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Dwarf.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 25 feet, and your extra language is Dwarvish. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Elf.*** Your Dexterity increases by 1 and either your Intelligence or Charisma increases by 1. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and your extra language is Elvish. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Halfling.*** Your Dexterity increases by 1 and your Strength increases by 1. Your size is small, your walk speed is 25 feet, and your extra language is Halfling. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Human.*** Your Strength increases by 1 and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and you gain one extra language of your choice. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Dragonborn.*** Your Strength increases by 2. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and your extra language is Draconic. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Gnome.*** Your Intelligence increases by 2. Your size is small, your walk speed is 25 feet, and your extra language is Gnomish. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Half-Elf.*** Your Charisma increases by 2. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and your extra language is Elvish. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Half-Orc.*** Your Strength increases by 2. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and your extra language is Orc. &gt; &gt;***Afflicted Tiefling.*** Your Charisma increases by 2. Your size is medium, your walk speed is 30 feet, and your extra language is Infernal. Similar to a Shifter's Subrace feature, but only determines ability score increases. For now, anyway. Idea given to me by /u/MrDave2176. Taken from the Shifter. Other ideas I've had, but decided not to include were a change in the character's ""true form"" (making it so that anyone who can see past magical disguises immediately recognizes the character as a lycanthrope.) and some sort of passive hit point regeneration instead of resistances. These ideas were scrapped. The first was too difficult to word in every ability without being confusing, and it goes against what the Lycanthrope information presented in the Monster Manual says outright. The second was trashed because I have no idea how to balance an ability that no other race that I know of has. Sure, certain baddies have HP regen, but it just seemed like such a fuss to balance. So, what do you guys think? Any suggestions as to how I can go about tweaking this race? I tried to keep it as simplistic as possible, but also balanced. Did I do a good? Edit: Some words. Edit: Changed the racial name to ""The Afflicted."" Implemented suggestion from /u/MrDave2176 allowing a base race to be chosen to go with the affliction. Edit: Changed Relentless Endurance to use your reaction to active Shapechanger. It seemed like a decent alternative. Edit: Changed Shapeshifter to increase AC by one, but all armor falls off during the transformation. Edit: Removed changed text, and added size, walk speed, and language to the base race section."

I like that weapon properties have been carried over from 4E, and I think the way they've been implemented improves on that idea. But I feel like the flail, morningstar, and war pick got left out in the cold. They deal the same damage as a battleaxe, longsword, rapier, and warhammer, but those all have properties. I doubt I'm the first to suggest this, but I thought up a few properties to make these weapons interesting, and hopefully not broken. Weapon | Properties ---|--- Flail | Breach Morningstar | Multitype (bludgeoning) War pick | Deadly ***Breach.*** This weapon is designed to bypass or puncture a target's shield. When attacking with this weapon, ignore any bonus your target may have that is derived from a physical shield (not the *shield* spell). ***Deadly.*** Designed to pierce deeply, this weapon is capable of inflicting tremendous damage. Whenever you deal damage to a target with this weapon and roll the maximum value on the damage die, roll the same die again and add it to the total damage. This effect can only occur once per action. ***Multitype.*** This weapon is designed to partially deal an additional type of damage, listed in parenthesis. For purposes of a target's damage vulnerability, consider both the weapon's primary and additional damage types. For purposes of a target's damage resistance or immunity, the additional damage type does not apply."

If this isn't allowed on this subreddit, I'd appreciate knowing where it can go so I can get some help c: So here we go... ----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Freya Wood Elf/Harpy 1.7m 80kg True Neutral Archer Freyas parents weren't the best of people in the world. A pair of wood elves so strongly drawn towards the darkest of gods that they had been removed from their tribe by force for fear of what they might do. They found a new home, deep inside the forest where few dared to tread to continue with their musings. Half the day they spent on survival, hunting for food, creating and mending their house while the other half they spent in sorcery. So deep was their devotion to the dark gods that they bewitched Freya while she was still in the womb. She was to be the perfect servant. A magical creation born from their bodies to serve as true power for any who might resist their beliefs. Freyas birth had been an... unusual one. Rather than emerging from her mother in the usual way, an egg was birthed, having grown to a large size within the womb. Her parents took it as a blessing. Their magicks had worked, and their child was to be an envoy of the gods. After some weeks of continued growth within the egg, a talon clawed its way free. She freed herself from the shell, looking dazed and confused, looking up to parents who couldn't seem prouder. While her parents had been pure wood elf, the magic that they had enchanted their daughter with from the dark energies they prayed upon for so many years, their daughter was more of a harpy. Her skin was much paler than her parents, causing a stark contrast to the deep grey, almost black of her hair, wings and talons. Her arms remained separate from her wings, ending claws which matched those on her feet, three sharp talons attempting to grip the air as though unsure what the air was at this point. Her wings were the same deep colour, feathered and large. They fluttered lightly as they realised they were able to stretch. Deep green eyes scanned around, seeing her parents for the first time. Her mouth opened, some sound trying to come out to call for them, but only an unintelligible babble coming. She grew up quickly under her parents care, them doing all they could to mould her into the being they wished she could be. They did what they could for 15 years, teaching her to hunt, to speak, to see things in their way. They tried to encourage her to walk on two legs like the rest of the world. She managed to walk in that way with a little difficulty, but once stopped she did need to lean on something or kneel with one hand on the ground to keep balance. They tried their best to teach her magic, to show her the spells they'd used to create her, to teach her the arcane ways, but her frame just didn't want to support it. They were clearly disappointed by this, but they had hope yet. After the years of training, they climbed her up to the top of the tallest tree they could climb. A show of the forest, they'd said. A chance to see things from a different angle. They pushed her from the top, telling her to use the wings she'd been born with. They caught the air an amount, enough to slow her fall but not enough to let her glide, let alone fly. She plummeted through the branches of the trees, cutting skin, breaking bones and killing trust. They took her back in afterwards, she was healed to the best they could, but she could see the change in them. They had wanted to see her fly. They still wanted to see her fly. They were determined. They weren't going to take no for an answer, not after the work they'd done to train her, to help her grow and be this symbol of perfection in their eyes. Right now, she was a failure and little more. Once she felt able to, Freya fled. She didn't want to have to deal with that look in their eyes, the knowledge that she would be pushed again and again until the limbs on her back decided to suddenly become functional. Wood elves were never meant to be able to fly. Their bone structures and weight distribution were all wrong, but enchant one with them and you expect them to suddenly take off? She lived for years in the forest alone, constantly moving to try and find somewhere that she might be able to settle alone. Each time she heard movement that wasn't that of a rabbit or other small animal she fled, not wanting to be found by her parents. It was only after a few years of this hiding that she began to trust that they were gone, that these larger creatures must have been something else. One day, she stayed in the shade of the trees, watching as she heard a group approach. They were other humanoids. Other beings of intelligence like herself, but not of elven persuasion like her parents. Humans and dwarfs wandering through, chatting amongst themselves, laughing. One at the front had a large blade made of metal which he used to carve away at the forest with such ease to grant the others an easier path for their exploration. Some of them had metal on their bodies as well, sheets of it covering places that would be the easiest for a predator to harm them. Curiosity caused her to follow these beings, watch as they set up camp in a clearing, removing some of the metal for comfort, sharing strips of dried meat and drinking from vessels clearly made for purpose. They had come to explore. There were people out there who came into the woods just for the sake of seeing what was here. The blade of metal was clearly sharp enough to cause harm to any beasts that may attack, they had come well prepared. Only two of them had these metal objects to protect them though. Another clearly had an array of magic up their sleeves, it had been she who had lit the fire they camped around and contained to ensure it didn't spread to destroy the entire forest. The last had sticks. Lots of sticks in a bundle and a larger stick with a string attached to both ends. How were sticks meant to be useful? While they slept, she tried to sneak in to examine the strange bundle of sticks, but could have done better at it. One was woken by her movements and called the others awake. She fled for a distance before stopping, using her natural ability to hide in plain sight in the foliage to watch those who chased her. Then she saw the sticks in action. The largest stick was the guide, the string taught and tense enough to bend it while the smaller were the ammunition. The strength of the wood and power of the string caused the smaller sticks to fly at speeds she could barely keep up with, causing her mouth to open. That was amazing. She wanted one. She fled to safety once more, using her knowledge of the forest to give herself great distance before the group previous had given up, safe in the knowledge that they'd scared her off. She attempted to make her own version of the bow she'd seen before, but the vines weren't able to withstand the pressure of the wood pulling against it, and the few times she had managed to get something, the sticks she used weren't straight enough and had no aim to them, let alone distance. The furthest her home made versions ever made it was flopping to the ground 5m in front of her. Once again she set off towards the edge of the forest, waiting for the next set of adventurers. At first she tried again to only grab the bows while those who wandered were asleep and less likely to notice her, but after that failed a number of times, she started to simply swoop in and take them from peoples hands while they were still travelling, the chase simply becoming part of the act of getting one. She gained a good collection pretty fast. There were tall bows and short bows and arrows with all sorts of tips made from stone and metal and shaped into a variety of patterns. Some experimentation had her working out what was what, which were best for killing which size of prey, though there were still many she had no idea what were for. Her dexterity with the bows increased over time, her aim improving as she learned how to manipulate her claws in ways that didn't slowly carve away at the bows over time. Many of the weapons were lost to having her claws split the string or mark the wood in a way that created a structural vulnerability. It took many years before she had perfected the art of being able to wield a bow without destroying it within 10 shots. She started to carry a short bow around with her at all times, either being clutched in one hand or hanging over one shoulder. She'd seen some people who woe them across their backs, but her wings made that almost impossible. The short bow was easy enough to carry around anyway, and the loss of range wasn't a terrible thing in the woods. She'd debated getting a belt and hanging it from there but the comfort she felt closer to the ground meant the bow would drag along the ground as well and she'd learned that they could be quite fragile already. Over time, she began to grow weary. She had lived on her own in these woods for decades now. She couldn't even tell you how long. She didn't even know how old she was anymore, the time just seemed to fade past as she lived her life. Her thoughts went back to the adventurers she saw come through so constantly. The people seemed so happy to be exploring somewhere new, ready for adventure and danger to happen at any moment. She knew her half of the woods very well by now, having given where he parents had lived a wide birth. She knew almost every branch, how to climb which trees for the best views and spots to catch prey by surprise for food. It was relaxing to not need to worry about what was happening, but the relaxation wasn't entirely worth the boredom. While she'd been learning how to use her bows without breaking them and exploring the forest in the first place it hadn't been too bad, but now... It took her a while to get the courage to leave the woods, to experience the world outside the canopy. The sun was harsh after life in the shade, and she found a good number of people decided that she was some form of monster. Her words were slow and not practised but she slowly learned to signal and infer things with her body with pointing, shrugging and moving her head to avoid needing to say things a lot of the time, only complicated things needing to be said. She learned about money, about how shiny coins were used to trade for things that you wanted. She learned that there were many more kinds of foods than those which she'd grown up with. She learned that people tended to sleep on beds made from fabrics rather than leaves and moss lain on the ground. There was so much to learn from these people. Things like laws and evil and how not to get annoyed at the 50th person that day asking if she could really fly with her wings. The amount of people who asked her that managed to help her learn sarcasm really quite quickly. ----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- Str: o Dex: o Con: o Int: - Wis: + Cha: o (left as an idea where rolled stats will go rather than putting in numbers that could get rejected and/or rerolled anyway) Notes: ~The wings will never work.

She does however have a high manual dexterity, so would get a small benefit for things involving her hands. ~True Neutral alignment can change depending on what she learns about good/evil, law/anarchy. ~Hand talons can be used as an attacking force if needed in melee, foot talons aren't sharp enough due to being worn from being walked on a lot. ----|----|----|----|----|----|----|---- How did I do? \^\^; Also looking for a group to put her in if there are any people around the UK who would let me in c:"

One of the finest, most effective ways to keep unwanted people away from precious things. **System:** Chirografs were made into existing doors and almost exclusively used on them, though there are some rumors of adventurers finding them on smaller things (like chests or trunks or windows). When newly made, they are easily spotted, though age and time can obscure them as paint and ink fades. A door with a Chirograft will have an intricate pattern of darkly inked lines drawn over it on both sides (if less than 100 years old, Passive Perception 10; up to 200 years, Passive Perception 15; up to 500 years, Passive Perception 20). Knowing what a Chirograft is, on noticing it, requires a History check DC 20 or a Religion check DC 15 (advantaged if also proficient in Arcane). Every failed attempt to open a Chirograft door increases the potency of the effect if triggered. As a result, ancient doors so trapped that have turned away many dungeon delvers over the ages are especially dangerous (Investigation Dc 10, if the Chirograft is noticed in the first place, to deterimine the age of the ink and wood). On a success, the PC can safely estimate an approximate age (and if they passed the history/Religion check or are informed by someone who has may know the rough DC and average damage of the trap). Attempting to open the door before the Chirograft is disabled inflicts a Charisma Save DC 14 as the Chirograft unleashes the power of the River and arcane energy washes over the PC, inflicting a curse of Magical Vulnerability on them (they are disadvantaged on Saves with respect to magical effects; can be removed with a Remove Curse and any appropriate divine prayer spoken over the removal, Religion check DC 10 to know any), inflicting 2d6 necrotic damage, and teleporting them 2d4 times 5ft. backwards (but not beyond a wall, if in a room, no collision damage). On a success, they suffer the same effect but no Curse. The lines and patterns on the door are a combination of Mage Hand infused ink and Bronze and Copper metal parts inside the door. With a Calligraphy or Painters toolkit, a proficient PC may duplicate the shade and texture of the ink easily and may attempt a Calligraphy or Painters Tools check DC 14 (the PC attempting this must also be proficient in Thieves Tools or be helped/assisted by someone that is, the pattern is a lock afterall). On a success, they alter the layout of the metallic parts of the door and disable the trap effect, unlocking the door in the process with dull metallic clicks sounding within. On a failure, the pattern is marred and one suffers the effects of an attempt to open the door as above, except their save is Disadvantaged. . **Witchfog** *The room was completely obscured in a grey-green mist. Squick could see only a few feet into the space, enough to make out the beautifully tiled floor done in vibrant blues and greens. It was part of some larger pattern, obviously, and the hedonist in him wondered if it was something lurid and wanton.* *""Do we go in?"", Teller's voice was hushed and told him that she was probably unsettled by the strange cloud. Brodie knew what it was, they'd seen this before down in the jungle last year. What was it with these bastards and the damned fog stuff? As near as Squick could tell, they weren't immune to it---the idea of flooding a place with something so dangerous when you couldn't guarantee safe passage? Madness.* *Heavens and hells, but Squick really hated Wespers. He lamented how he was likely going to lose his new scarf and, dammit, probably his new boots as well. But, nevertheless, without waiting for suggestions from the rest, he wrapped the scarf around his face, dropped his pack, borrowed Brodie's cloak, wrapped himself up tight, and closed his eyes while the old paladin shook out three waterskins all over him, soaking him to his socks.* **History:** The Wespers were a cult of warlocks infamous throughout the Southern Continent, a band of primal and chaotic devotees of a Great Old being beyond the skies they called The Pierced Flesh. It wasn't long, maybe a generation or so, before knowledge of their dark dealings and cruelties made it to the attention of the chiefs and governors of that land and the Wespers were hunted on sight, less one find corruption and devastation in one's domain. Wesper strongholds, both ones they created in the deep dark places of the jungle and ones they found and took over in the world (old tombs, keeps, hidden caverns) were rife with vicious traps and hazards. One of the most common was Witchfog, also known as Bloodsweat (for the appearance of victims of it in the first stages). **System:** Witchfog is entirely alchemical, it comes from a volatile concoction of rare, foreign reagents (some of which are unearthly) and a dark, masterful skill. The bubbling goo is almost pitch black, like tar, and gives off a constant release of an acidic fog designed to dissolve any porous substance it comes in contact with. An open container the size of a glass bottle can create enough acidic fog within a few seconds to fill a 15ft cube. If anyone has witnessed the brew ""running out"" it hasn't been documented, it seems to perpetually create the fog. One can notice the fog by both sight and smell (a pungent rotted apple scent) automatically, if within 10ft. of it (even through a door or non-air-tight barrier). History check DC 15 to recognize the scent or look, advantaged if one has any kind of scholarly background at all; beating the check by 5 (so, a total of 20 or higher) also informs the PC that the Wespers traditionally carved out a hollow in the stone or hard floor, filled it with an epoxy that created an alchemical glass, to make a sort of immovable cauldron to brew the fog in places they wanted protected. Ending one's turn in the fog, one must make a Constitution save DC 8 + the number of saves one has had to make times 2 (first save 8, second 10, third 12, and so on). On a failure, one takes a number of d6 points of acid damage equal to the number of saves one has had to make. A success, one only takes half the damage. The fog is so frictionless and vicious that retreating from the cloud to safety does not reset the save DC or increasing damage, as the particles are still in one's clothes and skin, ready to react. A thorough soap and water scrubbing can reset, however. At the end of one's first turn in the fog, one's carried and worn items are fine. At the end of one's second turn in the fog, any leather or cloth less than 1 inch wide/thick begins to dissolve (will require mending to survive hard use). At the end of the third turn, any thick leather or thin metal (daggers, rapiers, joints on some armor, mail) begins to damage similarly. At the end of the fourth turn, the thin leather and cloth dissolves entirely. At the end of the fifth turn, the thick leather and thin metal dissolves entirely. At the end of a sixth turn thick metal will be damaged, and at the end of a seventh turn it will be ruined. Soaking one's clothes and possessions will prevent the item damage and advantage one's self on the Constitution saves. Finding the ""cauldron"" is the hardest part, the DM should divide the room into quadrants (they can be rough) and write down on a card which the cauldron is in. Finding it requires an Investigation check (taking an action) while standing in a quadrant---this represents the PC straining to hear the bubbling, read the flow of the gas, even get low to the ground to try and see any change in the floor. At the end of their turn, make saves appropriately. If they don't find it, they will need to move and conduct another action. At the end of their turn, they can make saves appropriately. If they find it, however, disabling is relatively easy with an action. If the character has any kind of pot, bowl, or even a soaked blanket to cover the cauldron, it will suffice to keep the fog at bay for 1d4 minutes. A sealed, air-tight glass or polished stone cover will last 1d6 hours. Glassblower or Potters tools (DC 15) will allow the character to seal away the cauldron completely with an hour of work. Note, magical wind and similar attempts to blow away the fog are only partially effective as it dissipates and generates so fast from the cauldron that at best, it will buy a free turn without having to make saves for someone initially entering the space but no more than that (save DM fiat). Also, note that the actual black tar is dangerously acidic and will dissolve any object that touches it directly in moments. Attempts to ""sample"" it into other containers are likely to lose people fingers and hands as it chaotically bubbles and pops. .

416,vulnerability,DnD,The Dice of Fate,1,39jppw,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/39jppw/the_dice_of_fate/,2015-06-12 15:13:05,"There was a post here earlier about a pair of fancy 6-sided die that somebody's players had acquired, and they were convinced they were magic. So I thought the idea was fun and made a list of random nonsense that **The DICE OF FATE** could do. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Rolling the Dice of Fate is an action. Focus on a creature (yourself, an ally, or an enemy), then roll, and the dice will determine their fate. If the result requires a save against any effect, the DC is (8 + proficiency + wisdom modifier of the caster). There are 6 charges held in the dice, which are restored at dawn each day. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1 and 1 - 1d6 tiny yellow snakes pour from the target's eyes, dealing 1d6 force damage for each snake summoned. The snakes are hostile to all creatures and enter initiative right after the creature they came out of. 1 and 2 - An exact copy of the creature appears, and either shunts the creature five feet to the side or materializes five feet to the side of the creature. The duplicate works as Mirror Image with one double. 1 and 3 - The creature is rendered infertile. This can only be cured by a Greater Restoration spell. 1 and 4 - The creature is stricken with extreme pain, dealing 25% of their current health as force damage. 1 and 5 - The creature can use Mage Hand on their turn without expending an action. 1 and 6 - Casts Fireball centered on the target. 2 and 2 - Casts Mirror Image on the target. 2 and 3 - The creature has a 66 percent chance to succeed on their next action, regardless of proficency, ability modifier, or skill. If the action is an attack, it deals 66 percent of maximum damage. If the action requires other creatures to make a save, the creatures have a 33 percent chance of success. 2 and 4 - The target's skin turns to wood for 1d4 rounds. While they are wooden, they have resistance to bludgeoning damage and vulnerability to fire damage. 2 and 5 - The target is wracked by pain, dealing 10 percent of their maximum health as force damage. 2 and 6 - The target is stricken by a change of order. They shift 1d2 up or down the Lawful/Chaotic scale. 3 and 3 - The creature is transported to the Nine Hells for one turn. If they are of Good or Neutral in morality, they take 2d6 fire damage upon returning at the start of their next turn. If they are Neutral or Chaotic in disposition, they take 2d6 fire damage upon returning at the start of their next turn. Also, if they are a demon or one who consorts with demons, they take full damage. This means Lawful Good takes 2d6, Neutral Good takes 4d6 damage, Chaotic Good takes 4d6, Lawful Neutral takes 2d6, Unalligned (Neutral/Neutral) takes 4d6, Chaotic Neutral takes 4d6, Lawful Evil takes no damage, Neutral Evil takes 2d6 damage, And Chaotic Evil takes 4d6 damage. 3 and 4 - A portal opens in a space adjacent to the creature. The portal spits out a random celestial/demon/devil/abberration (1d4 to determine) that enters initiative after the targeted creature. The summoned creature returns to their plan of existence after 1d4 rounds. 3 and 5 - The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be dominated by the caster for 1d4-1 (minimum 1) rounds. 3 and 6 - The creature's Constitution increases to 18 for 1d4 rounds, if it is not already this high. If the creature's CON is already 18 or higher, it regains 36 HP. Any extra HP it regains above its maximum becomes temporary HP. 4 and 4 - The creature turns into an animate carriage for 4 rounds. The carriage retains the creature's mind, motives, and allignment, but is now Large, has resistance to all damage, a ground speed of 50 feet, and can seat a family of four comfortably. It also ignores difficult terrain and has advantage against dragons. Another creature can board the carriage for half their movement speed, and can drive it as an action with a successful opposed strength check. 4 and 5 - The target is thrown 20 feet in a random direction and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall prone. If it collides with anything, it takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage for every five feet remaining. If it hits another creature, that creature takes half as much damage and must succeed on a DC 10 Strength check or fall prone. 4 and 6 - A magical explosive mote is buried in the target creature's gut. It will explode in 24 hours. It works similar to a Delayed Blast Fireball, but starts at 24 fire damage and increases by 1d6 every hour. The mote can be surgically removed with a Medicine check as an action to uncover the mote (This deals 4d6 piercing damage to the creature on a fail, half as much if successful) and a Dexterity save as an action to dislodge and throw the explosive 40 feet. 5 and 5 - Creates a 5 by 5 wall of force surrounding the target. No one can enter or exit this wall for one turn, and the creature within has +2 AC and advantage on saving throws against spells. If the creature is Large or larger, the wall conforms to their shape, but gives them dissadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and ability checks. 5 and 6 - The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or they regress or advance (1d2) in age by 30 years. On a success, the age change is only 11 years. This can only be cured by a Greater Restoration spell. 6 and 6 - Petrifies the target for 1d6 rounds."

I don't even hate you. I regard you in the same way I regard the paper on which I scribble my careful messages or the base metal I forge into something of use. You're mortal, which means you're one of millions times millions of pestilential, short-lived things in this world and all others that I may use for a larger purpose.* *""Should I tell you my purpose? Again? I've told you before, of course. Your mind cannot hold its grandeur and naturally burns itself free of the knowledge each time. You used to speak clearly, that stutter is a sign you're slipping more. Your soul cannot handle the burden of my majesty. But, because it makes me laugh and happy, I'll tell you again.* *""Sshhhhh, careful boy, shhhh. No crying yet. I haven't even started. You'll need to steel yourself, you always scream at the end...""* **System:** The wars of mortals are won with diplomacy, bargaining, and some military force. The fool thinks it requires only the last bit. Great rebellions have overthrown powerful entrenched authorities only to themselves fracture and dissolve for lack of a solid web of support built by friendships, allies, and the careful sale of power, prestige, and resources to enemies. Paper wins wars. In the vast expanse of the planar hells, it is no different. The Fiends have brokered the Great War for eons, serving no side and facilitating treaties, exchanges, and accords. The Blisterkrau, a Fiend of the Eight Gate who brokered the sale of the Lands of Inx to the Lost Powers, took his reward and turned his eye toward the ruination of another sort. His warlocks have worked knowingly and unwittingly both for millenia towards this new end. His Shroud has been passed from cult to cult, from Warlock to Warlock, and grants its bearer a part to play in the great plan. Attunement requires the overthrow of a legitimate government (in the form of the disgraceful ousting of a mayor, the bankrupting of a town's administration, the institution of a different form of rulership, etc.). Once done, the Shroud---a pink and white, skin-soft robe as light as air---grants the wearer the ability to spend their Hit Dice to recover spell slots at an exchange rate of 4 HD for 1 slot for any non-warlock casters; 3 HD for 1 slot for warlocks; and 2 HD for 1 slot for Fiendish patron Warlocks. . **Revealers** *While Occam let the demon swing away at him, firey axe trailing a comet of light and smoke this way and that while the stern and scarred warrior stepped out of the way over and over in a physical taunt that enraged the thing, Beniss circled wide behind it. Staying out of its reach, out of its line of sight, trying to get around it and hoping it wouldn't notice. Chains wet with blood (its own? one of its victims'?) whipped gracefully, so smoothly that one forgot they were hundreds of pounds of arcane steel that would slap a man in half on impact.* *As Beniss found his opening (and Occam took a searing cut across his already horrifically puckered and lined chest), he ran a finger along the rings on his right hand. Hard, ghostly images flew around him, symbols of light and wisping smoke keeping perfect distance from his fingers as though locked in orbit around them. Once satisfied with whatever they were saying, he took a deep breath and pressed his other hand against the giant thing's leg.* *The symbols danced and changed, and Beniss had enough time to call out four short words before a bloody chain broke most of his ribs and left him dying on the dry, hard ground.* **System:** Divination magic is one of the great misunderstood elements of the arcane education. Novices and adepts gravitate, in all academies and amongst all private tutelages, toward Evocational and Conjurational lines of magic (and the truly power hungry dabble in the dark purple arts of reanimation and death). The Diviners have a quieter role. Studied by the usually less adventurous, quick to find appointment to a court, they form the backbone of the Arcane Traditions in a quiet way. Originally designed for scholarly pursuits, the Revealers have found some popularity amongst Diviners and mages seeking the life of discovery in the field and adventure in the hidden places of the world. Revealers are a set of three gold rings with a pearl inlay around the bands meant to be worn on the first two fingers and thumb. Attunement requires formal authorization from any of the Archmages of Divination (from any academy or scholam)---Evokers may allow their tools to be used by any hexslinger with a book and a grudge, but Diviners are somewhat more circumspect. Once attuned, the rings allow the wearer to draw forth knowledge of a creature by bringing its anima, its pattern in the cosmos, into focus and representing it with arcane symbols to be read. To use this ability, the wearer must calibrate the rings with an action (requiring the opposite hand to turn them just so to refract the light in a specific way). From there, the rings project readying runes of curiosity and inquiry around the wearer's hand. Upon touching a target creature with the other hand (the un-ringed hand), the runes of light start shifting and telegraphing information about the subject. So long as the un-ringed hand is in unbroken contact, at start of the wearer's turn they first get the creature's Type or Name (wearer's choice); at the start of their next turn (if still in contact), they get the creature's Damage Immunities or Damage Vulnerabilities (wearer's choice); and at the start of their third turn (if still in contact), they get a piece of the creature's pattern---giving the wearer advantage in attacks, saves, and ability checks against the creature for 24 hours. . **Boots of Proteas** *Kirig Vul had been murdering in these forests for nearly twenty years and was regarded far and wide amongst the gobs and hobs as one of the most dangerous warchiefs in their collective history. Sure, he hadn't any of the high weaponry or infrastructure of his taller cousins in the Hobgoblin nations, and didn't have the brutish might of the bugbears either. But his band of gobs were no less lethal in their element. Theirs was the warband that turned this corner of the Emperor's domain into a no man's land where even the Emperor's Own elite soldiers avoided at all cost.* *And here, the gods of the dark and warm were blessing Kirig. A lone stranger, mashing a turnip in a pot just as bold as you please. It'd be a quick kill, then, then a look at what's in his pack, then maybe take the head and leave it at the edge of the wood for a solid message to the Emperor that his subjects were not welcome. It'd been years since they'd done that.* *But, the stranger was gone. Suddenly, as though he'd not been there at all and were it not for the pot he'd have thought it all an illusion. Kirig felt a panic rise, the unknown was bad business for a brigand. And as he stood and started backing away, he bumped into someone behind him. Someone tall. Someone that had not been there a moment before.* **System:** In the time of the Weylthia Courts, which ruled the Great circle of the Fae before the Planar Godlings and Material Powers grew the universe, an Arch-Fey of the Hard Green formed a proto-world for its own amusement and curiosity. The worldling was small and simple, it grew its grasses and strange beasts grazed it and in the flash of an eye after centuries of gardening, it was voided from existence as the Fey found a new distraction. Just as carelessly, she took a pair of boots made by a primitive sentient tribe that had developed there and dropped them into the now created real world. Such is the chaotic indifference of the alien Fey. The Boots are made of the barest substance of pure creation itself. Resembling woven boots of thick, dark blue grass, they grant the wearer an affinity for the earth in ways no arcane or divine powers can truly duplicate. Attunement requires being buried alive in the boots for three days. No food or water, no magical or other assistance. Communing with the soil and the earth on a deep and somewhat maddening level. Once attuned the boots allow the wearer to sink into and merge with natural ground for extended period of times. Using an action, one may drop into natural ground one is standing on, falling deep below the surface and merging with the soil and roots and clay and sands and rocks underneath. One is immune to all damage types while merged except Necrotic and should anyone target the ground with Necrotic damage within 10ft. of where one initially merged one will take double damage (having Vulnerability). One has a movement while merged equal to 5ft times their proficiency bonus. Returning imposes 1 exhaustion on the wearer and requires a bonus action. . the last two, ""The Feast"" and ""Sola Scriptura"" at [manysideddice.com](URL"

He hardly remembered what she looked like, back when they were young. They'd survived the war, the purge... and he'd been the only one to survive the bare winter that followed. She had red hair. She liked climbing trees.* *That was nearly two hundred years ago, and it felt longer. Every sacrifice made the years seem longer, and even now---as he stared at his son, foolish and weak thing that his progeny was---he was reminded of why he did this. Reminded of the long game. Reminded that empires are not destroyed with a few bold fights but with the force of the ages and a will ready to make the sacrifices necessary to temper the steel of a thousand knives.* *His followers were many, carefully chosen over the generations---brought into the great circle of being. They knew how he prolonged his life, they knew about all of his children over the centuries. They honored them. He honored them. The fawn that falls to the wolf is a part of the larger destiny of the wild.* *He would bring the empire to its knees. He was the wolf that leads the pack, the pack would devour this weak false kingdom. He would do it for the greater good of the world, and not a little for the redhaired girl on whose bones this city was built.* **System:** The Scepter is a two foot shaft of hewn obsidian, the glassy rock bears the marks of being fashioned from small chipping tools with great care. When held to the light, the naturally dark black material shines a translucent green---deep as the canopy of an old forest. To the casual observer, it is the sort of thing a distinguished man of gentle birth might carry on a walk through a garden. It was, in the oldest time, the focus of a druidic cult intent on changing the world itself. Attunement to the Scepter requires siring progeny. Once the child is born, the Scepter becomes active and the wielder becomes the fulcrum to the turning of great events and grants three distinct abilities. First, the wielder may grant a spell to another. Doing so loans the spellslot the spell is to be cast to the recipient. They do not have to be willing. The wielder chooses a target, chooses a spell they can case, and the appropriate slot---the recipient now has that slot, regains the slot in the same manner the wielder does normally, and can use it to cast only that spell. This lasts for a number of years equal to 10 minus the spell's level. It may be returned to the wielder on the death of the recipient, but no sooner. Second, the wielder may use a reaction to speak a phrase in Druidic to another who knows the language---the effect of which is similar to the Help action (in granting advantage on an ability check or save only, though). Third, on the final death of the wielder---3 failed death saves, as the most common example---the wielder is born again through the child they sired. They grow bodily from the child's own form, tearing through it (killing the child in the process), and emerge at half the age and one level lower than when they died. They then must reattune to the Scepter to use its abilities. . **Eighth Wand of the Good Man** *""The world hates you. I hear it. You think the green is the only power in the world?

A druidic sect that sought to eliminate virtually all life in a great plan to return the world to its most primordial and simple state---its form before the great beings came, before gods, before powers of any kind shaped people or higher creatures. The Goodman's sect was the focus of the Far War. which destroyed what was, before what is came to be. One of the weapons of his crusade, the least of them, was a wand fashioned from a cruel, jagged spike of perpetually smoking dry, sandy ice--devastatingly cold and menacing to the touch. A piece of the world that was. Attunement to the wand requires surviving one month, a full turn of the moon, without any trappings of civilization or magical support. A month of natural ability, crafting no tools, using no technologies or divine or arcane assistance. Pure survival in the wild. Every three days requires a Survival Check DC appropriate to the terrain (5 for a place with abundant water and fauna, 15 for a place of varying and uncertain wilderness, 25 for a place somewhat barren, etc.). The DM is encouraged to look to starvation, thirst, etc. rules to govern how bad or lethal it can be to have poor results. Backing out requires starting over. Once attuned the wand allows the wielder to bring to bear on their surroundings the fury and inhospitable effects of the worst of natural environments. The wand has 7 charges, replenishing 1d4 charges per day spent outside of developed settlements or cities. With an action, one may bring the dry, blistering heat of the Infinite Desert to bear around themselves---all creatures within 60ft. must make a Con Save DC 5 multiplied by the number of charges spent with the action (evoking more and more the unforgiving, searing heat of the baked sands and arid vastness). Failures grant 1 exhaustion and the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of every turn they spend in the radius for as long as Concentration is held by the wielder. With an action, one may bring the surging, powerful and rolling power of the unforgiving sea in a storm---all creatures in a radius equal to 5ft multiplied by the number of charges spent find themselves choking on chilly sea-water (suffocation rules may apply, if the creature requires breathing) and slowed and crushed by unseen waves. While within the radius, movement is reduced to 5ft and there is a 50% chance once movement is declared that they are tossed 5ft in the opposite direction they wished to go (only for movement, having no effect on Dash actions or magical forms of movement or movement caused by others). With an action, one may inflict the worst of the high tundras and great barren peaks of the mountains upon a target. Target makes a Strength Save DC 5 times the number of charges spent with the action to push Vulnerability to Cold onto a target for one round. The icy bite of the desolate high places above the clouds grasping them fiercely for a moment. . the last one, the ""Shade of Life"" at [manysideddice.wordpress.com](URL "

And not once had the young man said more than two words to Broadways in tha time. He had jokes for Meila and traded news with Teller, but he'd been avoiding the old man at every turn. It made Broadways suspicious. It wasn't until last night that he'd let all that wariness melt away to whatever this melancholy was.* *In the middle of the meal, when the others were turning their bedrolls out, the young warrior took a bare moment and whispered.* *""I'm sorry I left you, Brodie---I'm sorry to have put all this on you. The Way is a circle, and long is its course.""* **System:** Abin's Course are a pair of simple, light, and immaculately crafted boots. The sole is thin, but impossibly durable, worn only barely by what (surprisingly) has been centuries of use. The dark brown boots are crisscrossed with threads of dusty white metal. Initial attunement is accomplished with a choice. The boots will be found---they are only ever found---usually laying in dangerous places. Upon putting them on, one is given the choice. Either accept the burden---The Way---an oath and path of conduct blessed by the sovereign gods or not. If rejected, the boots slowly vanish and cannot be located. If accepted, the PC must take their next level or levels in Monk or Paladin until they select a Monastic Tradition or Sacred Oath. If they currently already have a Monastic Tradition or Oath, this will alter (though not replace) some miscellaneous tenants of it. Should they die before achieving their Tradition or Oath, the boots fade away to find another suitable person of worth. Once attuned and worn, the PC becomes the next link in a chain of a great mission and path that has gone back centuries. The DM is encouraged to forge an interesting flavor to what their role is to be in it and what works are needed from the PC to honor it. It may add some elements to a Sacred Oath, it may shift some details in keeping a Tradition. The PC's mind is flooded with memories of all who have worn the Course before and how they are part of an ages old quest that will, indeed, go beyond their own lives as well. The wearer of the Course gets death saves as normal except the fail range is from 1-15 instead of 1-10. On their third failure, their spirit is lifted from their body and moves on to the rewards of the Great Circle, their burdens and the Course, passing to another. The boots will vanish from their body, no magical or other means can stop it, and put themselves in the path of a hero or one who is destined to become one. The player may select two of the five following elements of this new hero: * Ability Scores (the same stats their previous had) * Race (and subrace) * Background (and proficiencies/languages only) * Class (and archetype--max level one less than their previous had) * Feats (the same feats their previous had, in order taken, where possible) The remaining two elements not selected are done by the DM. For elements like Ability Scores (up to same stats had by original) or Class (including level-1), if one does not select them, the DM may (though they also may not) select the minimum RAW value for these for a playable character--or any in between. Wherever that character is, the boots are found by them at the same moment the original wearer dies. They had the choice and accepted it. Play begins for the new PC at the point of taking on the responsiblity. Their new PC gets flashed of memories and knows (as the original did) things about the history of the Course (the DM is encouraged to add snippets of the coming great struggle or purpose of their mission). The Way is a circle and it's course is long. . **Consecrated Bakama** *Being blessed means being cursed. There is no gain in circumventing the Way. The Way is a circle and its course is long. When you trace a circle upon the ground, Kaei, and then trace your finger around it---as you advance in one direction are you not also retreating from the other?* *This is part of the Way. And it is a part all who live by it must know.* *That is not to say that one must never choose a direction---for standing only still is not the Way. Place, here yes, your finger. Do not move it. Are you a true part of the circle? You are a point. You could be a point in any figure. On any path. BY staying only still you are not following the Way but scared of it.* *That is not part of the way. And you must know that as well.* *Some may think---when they see us go about our lives---that it is chaos. It is like the rain, they think. It falls and cares not where or cannot be known. But, truly it is not. It is not us who are the drops of the rain, falling randomly through the skies to moisten a random bit of ground. We are instead the man who walks through the rain to get home. We will get wet and not wet, it does not matter either way, so long as we continue walking.* **System:** The bakama is a coarse garment, finely made but rugged in utility. It is unadorned by any interesting pattern or color. A beige heavy cloth cut in such a way as to make a loose-fitting blouse and trouser that must be carefully wrapped and tied around the waist and shoulders. Great care must go into wearing the bakama. The sacred followers of the Way---hidden in their valley---created the bakama to teach their champions to appreciate the full circle of the world's dangers and protect them from some. Attunement requires a ceremonial donning of the outfit (DC History 20) and the appropriate sworn oath to wear it through all of one's trials and travails until one knows the full story of the pain of the world. Once attuned, it's granted powers come alive---but at a cost. One cannot gain the benefit of any armor when attuned to the bakama---worn or not. Every day requires re-donning the garment (a 10 minute process, intricate) and removing takes as much time. Each day, the wearer may select one damage type to be resistant to (must be a different one each time they pick, there are thirteen--acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, thunder). Of the remaining, the DM rolls 1d12 to pick the second type one may be resistant to (numbered alphabetically, less the one already picked). The DM then lists the damage types in any order they wish on a notecard and numbers them (less the first one picked by the PC that day), and rolls 1d12. The number is documented on the back of the card (openly) and the DM knows (secretly) which damage type is selected by that roll. That damage type is what the PC is vulnerable to today. Only an attack or intentionally hostile effect from another creature triggers the DM revealing the vulnerability by turning over the card (and then, naturally, applying the appropriate damage effects). Any attempts to divine or otherwise reveal the damage do not work. The bakama unattunes at sunrise following the day the PC has experienced resistance to all damage types during this time. They may reattune as desired. . the last one, ""The Hurricane Gallichon"" at [manysideddice.com](URL"
422,vulnerability,DnD,An improvised boss fight I am very proud of.,2,32gqvg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/32gqvg/an_improvised_boss_fight_i_am_very_proud_of/,2015-04-14 03:50:29,"Last night I finished the second last campaign of my session. I decided the players would fight the resident Small God (see Terry Pratchett), Labba. I didnt have him in my notes, but I the party was level 5, so I looked through the MM for some cool level 6 guys to re-skin. I chose Githzerai Zerth (p161) and Galeb Duhr (p139). Party: Nixie Curse bloodline Sorcerer, Thief Rogue, Open Hand Monk, Hunter Ranger, and later TWF Dex Battlemaster Fighter. Also 3 Fighter/1 Paladin NPC. So I dropped them into a huge cave (180x80 feet) and made sure it was dark. Sorcerer lights a torch then casts light on the torch. I love my group. Anyway they walk forward and see a pair of legs at the edge of their distance. Our rogue has 35 move and dash + dash for a total of 110 move so the sorcerer uses light on him. The glowing rogue chases the legs down, but no matter how fast he moves the legs stay just out of vision. He gets to a wall and the legs just phase through. The Monk at this point had landed and started speaking Spanish (he has an app), and so the God phased him shin deep into the ground. Then, the sorcerer notices that on the other side of the light, behind the rogue, is a floating torso. He goes in for the Kill. From above them all, the head (which is NOT attached to the torso) yells out from above roll for initiative! The monks floor-trap turns to sand and the fight starts. Notable points. For the entire fight, the legs (Galeb Duhr) was latched onto the rogues position. They were always 30ft ahead, so the rogue switched to ranged attacks (lazor eyes). The party fought the legs and torso. During the second or third round I made a chart of random effects for the head to call out. They last for a round:  damage, 2x damage,  dmg but it heals, 2x speed, regenerate 5hp, regenerate 1 spell slot/ point (ki, sorcerer). (roll a d6, no effects happen twice) They fought until the body parts were all assembled (about the time the fighter showed up from work), except for the NPC. She was making magic circles in the Monks sand. When the parts were defeated, they assembled into one dangerous body, still latched to the rogues movement. The NPC called out Go easy on him. So the sorcerer casts fireball with his new found slot. No damage, except to allies. The boss is invulnerable. Now what? Bring him into this magic circle! They do, thanks to the boss being latched to the rogue and the rogues 110 movespeed. And some clever inter-party grappling. The vulnerability washes off and the party take down the boss. Good fight. 1850 experience, see you next session."
423,vulnerability,DnD,A little confused about damage resistances,1,2zsfiy,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2zsfiy/a_little_confused_about_damage_resistances/,2015-03-21 19:06:32,"My party's been fighting a frak-ton of skeletons lately, and I've been using a quarterstaff instead of my favorite dagger because more experienced group members have been telling me that most undead are resistant to slashing and piercing damage. However, I just looked up the PHB's entry on skeletons and it doesn't say anything about resistances, only that they're immune to poison and have *vulnerability* to bludgeoning damage. Of course, vulnerability's as good a reason to swap weapons as any, but would my dagger have indeed caused full damage to those skeletons? Was that advice I'd been given outdated? Or is there some sort of undead-wide damage ruling that I'm unaware of? Also, on the subject of vulnerabilities and resistances, I'm not sure how magic weapons interact with these monster properties. The only resistance that a magic weapon will negate is the specific resistance to non-magic and non-silvered weapons, right? A magic weapon wouldn't ignore resistance to bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage? Thanks in advance for helping a noob out!"

425,vulnerability,DnD,A Comprehensive Guide to Iksar: The Lizardfolk of Tomorrow,2,2uocy5,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2uocy5/a_comprehensive_guide_to_iksar_the_lizardfolk_of/,2015-02-04 07:45:20,"This is a part of my ongoing series; creating, fleshing out, and providing attributes for a group of races to be played in the 5E format. These are all on par with the basic races in the Player's Handbook and should be just fine to play alongside them. These additional races have come from the world of a video game called EverQuest, I created them for 5E in order to: * Have more races at the player's disposal. * And have the ability to play a tabletop in the world of EverQuest; the intricacies and race relationships in the world is quite interesting. Please feel free to leave comments, concerns and questions. I hope you enjoy. I used the 3.5 Edition EQ and EQ 2 Player's Handbooks and /u/JamesMusicus and /u/Aranim's [5E Race Analysis/Creation Guide](URL as source material. **Iksar** *Ksharn paced the floor of the dank dungeon, his clawed hands flexing. He flicked his tongue against his sharp teeth annoyingly and hissed. He knew his best apprentices were working on the human now, but so far, the human had been resistant to their techniques. Ksharn understood that they knew their work, but if they didn't get their answers soon the human's life might well be exhausted. Continuing to ensure his race's safety and secrecy was Ksharn's duty and this human, the lone survivor of a raiding party in Cabilis, may hold the key in understanding how much the enemy knew.* *If he told them before he died.* Born and bred as slaves of an extinct race, the iksar rose up and destroyed their captors. Hellbent on never allowing them to be enthralled again, the iksar expanded quickly. Strength above all else. They grew a mighty empire, only to draw the attention of greedy dragons, who after a long war destroyed the once great empire of the iksar. Reduced back to their starting grounds; small, meagre lands they are more empowered and bitter than ever. Thought to be an inherently evil race by outsiders, the iksar are incredibly xenophobic and are generally hostile with anyone entering their lands. **Proud and Scaly** A powerful race, they stand of a height with humans and are incredibly lean. They are incredibly lean, their musculature is dense, they weigh an average of 200 pounds or more. They generally have a crest of small horns on either side of their face following their snout and back above their eyes. Their thick tail gives them great balance and helps them swim. Their body scales tend to range from gray to brown and although many other races find it hard to tell females and males apart, females tend to be more slender and have brightly colored facial scales. Iksar weapons, clothing and equipment range from simple to seemingly bizarre, as with their ceremonial curved swords. Most iksar wear nothing but a few strips of leather and straps for carrying pouches and weapons. Occasionally iksar will wear rings and bracelets of precious metals, though none truly care for gemstones. Some iksar females dye their scales in brightly colored patterns much like other races dye their hair. **Bristly Demeanor** Although not truly inherently evil, they have, as a race, realized that some evils are a necessary means to an end. Iksars are a proud and distrustful race and they value strength above all else. Violence begets violence in their minds and the lack of action is considered weak. Their history is long and brutal, beginning as slaves and then having their empire destroyed by dragons, they now leave no tool untouched when it comes to rebuilding what they've lost. Pain, fear and torture are simply devices to use to get results, they have suppressed any distaste and misgivings these things bring other races in order to carry out their deeds. Some iksar do whole-heartedly believe in good fortune and virtue, but understand, without the strength to enforce such ideals, they are pointless. Iksar also believe that their body is a weapon, a tool. Although some of their warriors and clerics wear armor, they generally look down on races that depend on weapons, armor and shelter. They have no problem killing game with their bare hands and eating things raw. Many other races believe them to be an evil race, counting them among dark elves, ogres, trolls and perhaps tieflings, but in truth the Iksar hate these races just as much, not fond of their senseless evil. **Order and Surprising Civility** Iksar society is very orderly and organized. Every iksar has a position, rank and authority understood by every citizen. They have no place for those who do not conform, casting them down into an unwanted, untouched chaste or even exile. Their only stronghold to survive the war against the dragons is Cabilis, the capital to their small nation. Contrary to what most expect, Cabilis is a bustling city with merchants, guilds, inns, smithies and even libraries. Instead of streets, the entire city is built upon a lake, its thoroughfares are all waterways. Instead of horse carts and wagons, they are traversed by boat or by iksar simply slipping into the water and swimming. It is first and foremost a very formidable fortification, and at its core is a military stronghold. Many of their old strongholds now lay in ruins or are inhabited by their enemies. Those few members of outside races that have been welcomed into Cabilis know that even a large, well-armed army might not make it inside the city, much less leave. Those few members often talk about the strange, but ordered and peaceful society the iksar have behind those walls. **Scouts, Rebellion and Courage** Any iksar leaving on a life of adventuring has great courage. To leave their society and walk into the vast, unwelcoming unknown is a great burden. Most iksar who leave to go adventure, leave for one of two reasons. Either they are sent on a mission from their superiors to gain great power, knowledge and to report back, furthering their goals to carve out a new empire. Some leave because they did not fit in with the rigid iksar society and have been either cast out or leave on their own accord. Some escape the brutal life of the lowest chaste to try their lot among the other races. Iksar have done little to help the outside perception of their race and most find it hard to find acceptance or even safe haven among the other races. **Iksar Names** Iksar names are very hard to pronounce for other races, a mixture of hissing, growling and clicks. * ***Male Names:*** Cabkoris, Chasartiz, Jantiz, Jarraaz, Juksis, Kebaz, Kkortiz, Ksharn, Matranak, Sikkorsis, Sulaz, Xantranle, Zarulm, Zorshais. * ***Female Names:*** Cakazu, Cebansisu, Chikkorilu, Chorili, Jabitzu, Jaranika, Mkoriku, Rakshaazi, Ratraraza, Rebaslei, Sanaky, Sebanlea, Silulika, Xakanley, Zikorisy. **Iksar Traits** ***Ability Score Increases:*** Your Strength score increases by 2. Your Wisdom score increases by 1. *(Originally included a Dexterity score increase of 1 as well, but removed due to feedback.)* ***Age:*** Iksar reach maturity by the time they are 25 and generally reach 150. ***Alignment:*** Most iksar are lawful, believing firmly in their society and laws. They tend to be of a neutral persuasion, not relishing in evil acts but doing what must be done. Many iksar are evil, but most use evil as a means to an end and don't relish it or do anything senselessly evil. Their belief in the strong rule over the weak is thought to be somewhat of an evil characteristic. ***Size:*** Iksar stand roughly 6 feet tall and weighing on average around 200 pounds or more. Your size is Medium. ***Speed:*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. ***Darkvision:*** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. ***Swim:*** Iksars have a powerful tail used to help them navigate their waterways of their towns. Your base swimming speed is 30 feet. ***Damage Resistance:*** You have resistance to fire damage thanks to your tough scales. ***Natural Armor:*** Your thick hide and scales allows your base AC to be 12 plus your Dexterity score while not wearing any armor. *(Removed Unarmored Defense addition due to feedback.)* ***Cold Disadvantage:*** Inherent with the iksar scales, their supposed cold-bloodedness and their tendency to wear little or no clothing, iksar have disadvantage while rolling saving throws against cold damage. *(Originally Vulnerability to Cold, changed due to ""scoring."")* ***Languages:*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Iksar/Lizardfolk.

These are all on par with the basic races in the Player's Handbook and should be just fine to play alongside them. These additional races have come from the world of a video game called EverQuest, I created them for 5E in order to: * Have more races at the player's disposal. * And have the ability to play a tabletop in the world of EverQuest; the intricacies and race relationships in the world is quite interesting. Please feel free to leave comments, concerns and questions. I hope you enjoy. I used the 3.5 Edition EQ and EQ 2 Player's Handbooks and /u/JamesMusicus and /u/Aranim's [5E Race Analysis/Creation Guide](URL as source material. **Trolls (Half-Trolls)** *Gumguk flipped the jar upside down and scraped the last of the pickled halfling out. He tossed the scraps into his mouth and chewed nastily, mouth agape as he smiled up at the stars.* *Gumguk looked around at his Bashers, the ten trolls sitting around the campfire, feasting on the flesh of froglok and halfling alike.* *Gumguk stood wiping his mouth, We survive. We go back to Grobb. We kill da froglok, feast on flesh. Burn da critters! We gotta find da trolls. We gotta take back home! We da trolls! We will win!* *His Bashers stood, chanting between mouthfuls, We da trolls! We will win!* *Gumguk could feel the earth quake in fear, for nothing stands in the way of the Bashers.* Trolls are the least civilized and possibly the least intelligent race. Whether they are the product of trolls and other races mating, a group of beasts just past the evolution of civilization, or an ancient race who has lost it's way is besides the point. Trolls are by far the most vicious and evil of the civilized races, if you can call them civilized. **Giant, Green Beasts** Trolls typically stand just over 8 feet tall and are quite broad, weighing approximately 500 pounds. They have rough, greenish, hairless hides that are frequently covered with scars and scaly patches. They have large powerful arms, hunched shoulders and short, stout legs, pronounced noses and chins and long pointed ears that are almost triple the size of elven ears. Their eyes, slightly reptilian, can be red, yellow, green, purple or orange. Their teeth are small and sharp. They clothing and equipment is patchwork at best, although surprisingly practical. They have a great fondness for gems, but generally hoard such treasures rather than wear them. **You Won't Like Them When They're Angry** A savage and power-hungry race, the trolls are trusted by no one, not even other trolls. Trolls have a large appetite and have been known to be great cooks, unfortunately their cuisine leaves much to be desired for the palates of other races. Trolls consider other intelligent races as delectables, and with anything else they desire, they cannot hold back. Pickling is a great tradition in the troll culture, and pickled halfling, gnome and elves are considered best. Other races have different recipes that work best for their meat. Trolls will also eat other trolls if no other races present themselves. Trolls are violent, brutal and greedy. They think nothing of torturing their enemies and wearing body parts as decoration. Fortunately for all the other races, trolls are not well organized and distrust each other enough to work together on a large scale. This is one of the major reason the frogloks were able to defeat them and kick them out of their swamp and city, Grobb. Even disorganized and in small numbers, trolls present a major threat to all the civilized races of the world. Trolls don't seem to like anyone, although they treat with dark elves and seem to consider ogres as distant and mistrusted cousins. Troll women are incredibly fickle and jealous and will attempt to burn and ruin the faces of their rivals. Troll men will bully and torture as many other trolls as they can into submission. This is how the troll community is run. Some trolls despise their own race even more than all the others, attempting to gain access into other cultures. Defending them from other trolls, or bullying the weaker races. Some find some small acceptance within Halas and with the barbarians, as long as no outright slaughter or consumption happens under their roofs. **Loss of a Homeland** It was easier for other races to ignore the trolls when they dwelled deep in their swamp, away from everyone else. Now, however, the frogloks have evicted the trolls into the world of the other civilized races. While many trolls wander now, wreaking havoc on what they will. Most are being housed in ogre towns attempting to put aside all their petty differences to stand together and take back what they believe is rightfully theirs. In the southern swamps stood their greatest city, Grobb. Fortified by some stone hills, Grobb was mostly a collection of open areas with a few crude stone huts and timber structures. A cruder, crueler, and basic town might not be found in all of the realm, but Grobb meant something to the trolls, even if they hate each other. Only time will tell if the trolls can stop their fighting, end their mistrust and band together to take back their swamp. Small bands of fighting trolls are called Bashers, and are incredibly powerful. If ever one would see an actual army of trolls, it surely would be the last thing they ever do see. **Escape Their Fate** If an adventuring troll is not a guard or mercenary for some dark elves or ogres, then surely she is fleeing whatever fate awaits her at the hands of other trolls. Some may seek to find advantage by dealing with the weaker races, but most run from home in order to save their own skins. Trolls find it even more difficult to gain acceptance from other races than ogres, as even the most peaceful of people's mindsets are to kill trolls on sight. **Troll Names** Similar to ogre fashion, troll names are simple and short. * ***Male Names:*** Babkak, Bazbkuk, Gaglaak, Gankaz, Gmak, Gumguk, Kamrak, Kuzbuk, Nagzak, Nazmum, Nlaz, Rbal, Ranbkan, Rukek, Zulab. * ***Female Names:*** Beka, Blauko, Gaanu, Gagbkaka, Gamazu, Gamkako, Gulaabu, Kakbkuma, Kammuka, Kraka, Nbuka, Nuana, Rambaka, Zammala, Zazbgaza. **Troll Traits** ***Ability Score Increase:*** Your Constitution score increases by 2 and your Strength score increases by 2. ***Age:*** Troll reach maturity around 10 and rarely live into their 60's. ***Alignment:*** The vast majority of trolls if not all of them are evil.

432,vulnerability,DnD,[4E] Designing boss encounters that don't make the players feel cheated.,1,2tqhjc,http://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/2tqhjc/4e_designing_boss_encounters_that_dont_make_the/,2015-01-27 03:55:30,"I have read the blogs on how to spice up solo encounters in 4e. For those that maybe unaware experienced groups tend to get reliable action denial on mobs and do nova damage and with solo creatures that can be a huge issue. The thing I wish to do is have several lighter combats and then a multistage fight with actual mechanics. For example a Golem of some type that starts with a high DR, every hit lowers the DR and releases a smaller mob. At a certain point the boss splits and releases energy that basically allows for a short rest. Now there are 4 mobs that basically have vulnerability while still 'shredding' off extra mobs. Another example would be a twins fight where the farther apart their health is the more DR the lower one gets and allows the one with higher health to recharge attacks more frequently. When they both get bloodied there is an 'intermission' fight preventing them from recharging at a crystal of energy. By making that crystal explode the players get a short rest and the rest of the fight continues with the twins having slightly altered abilities from the crystal exploding. Last idea being a fight with lots of persistent damage in a necrotic cavern with a corrupted beacon of light. There are smaller mobs that come in and out on the side that when killed give small amounts of health to the whole party and damage mobs. The mobs themselves have various tools to prevent the party from healing properly on their own like surge denial. On killing the mobs the beacon is purified restoring all surges and short rest mechanics while the necrotic beings from one big mob for the players to destroy. Now I feel like with interesting terrain those are fun, engaging fights that can take up a whole session. The problem is that on the player side, how cheated I would feel. Meta game knowledge on this stuff is common in other types of games but not tabletops. There is no retries here as well, this is a one and done thing. As a player how much prior knowledge for this type of encounter do you feel is needed and how do you feel it should be discovered? The 2 ideas I have are knowledge checks by the players during the encounter or discovering the information during the quest with tombs, translated wall glyphs, interrogations, etc."

Justin Bellamonte, ""Races of Caveltania"" They never thought it would come to this. Usually they were so careful, but it seems all of their preparation didn't matter. The elven hunter spun to find his foe, but found only darkness beneath the boughs of the darkened Caveltania glades. They had been hired to hunt these creatures. After all, they had slain a werewolf before. Surely they were prepared. But these were not werewolves. They were large, muscular, and fast, like werewolves, but intelligent and sharp. They had turned the hunt aroud. One of them had acted as bait and drawn them into a trap that had driven them apart like a wedge, and now the hunter was isolated. He stopped, hearing only his breathing, and realized he could not hear the other hunters. His breathing grew more unsteady as the silence continued, until finally he heard a rustling of bushes behind him. He spun to face his attacker, and saw only an open maw filled with razor sharp teeth hurtling towards his throat before everything went dark. Cursed fathers, cursed sons Lupine are a race generally as reviled as werewolves, but they are not actually werewolves. They are the unholy offspring of two werewolves, or a werewolf and a human, elf, or some other similar race, or, more commonly, simply two other lupine. Like their parents, they retain the curse of Lycanthropy, with several critical differences. First, the curse is not as pronounced. Many of the immunities and strengths true lycanthropes enjoy are not available to Lupine, but by the same right, many of their weaknesses and flaws are also mitigated. Lupine are locked in hybrid form permanently, but do not lose control of themselves on a full moon. Full moons are compelling to them, but they can simply choose not to act on the aggression it encourages. Few, however, do. Lupine are generally as hateful and bloodthirsty as their parents, but thankfully, such fits of aggression are not a major threat beyond the damage the lupine itself can inflict. They cannot spread the curse of lycanthropy any longer, but they cannot be cured of it any longer. The form they were born with is the form they are stuck with permanently. Moonborn Lupine generally form communities far from civilization, usually in preferred hunting grounds. They take care not to disturb any settled races nearby, lest those races find out their existence and seek their removal. When they do disturb such settlements, it is always in the dead of night, in perfect stealth, and they take care to leave no trace of their passage. If they are discovered, one lupine may be offered up wounded as a sacrifice, in the hopes the settled creatures will believe just the single creature was responsible, kill them, and assume victory. Despite being very unpleasant and even violent, Lupine have a religion that teaches harmony with nature. This religious doctrine refers to them as Moonborn, and teaches the Lupine to give in to their carnal animal ways, to take pleasure in the hunt, that everything a Lupine does helps or harms the entire clan, and to bask in the glories of nature. It is everything primal, savage, and at the same time beautiful. Those who adhere to this doctrine tend towards a more neutral alignment, channeling their natural bloodthirst and craving of excitement into more constructive outlets that create a positive influence on their communities rather than a negative one. It also teaches that the Lupine are the true form nature intended, and the curse of Lycanthropy is actually the curse of imperfection. Thus, those who adhere to Moonborn doctrine also have a disdain for Werewolves, who they view as imperfect bastardizations of lupine form, driven mad and mindless by their own shortcoming. Lupine are extremely competitive, especially in all things physical. They take delight in being the best runners, the best climbers, the best swimmers, and the best leapers, and parade these accomplishments around when they can. Lupine strive for excellence in these regards, and respect any creature who shows considerable physical prowess. Even so, they respect cunning as well, for they know that simple strength is rarely enough. Strength is a tool, and tools are only as effective as those who wield them. Thus they also have a respect for creatures who use stealth to bolster their effectiveness, though they have no special love for creatures who use it as a crutch to compensate their physical weakness. Wanderlust Lupine are curious by nature, always seeking to understand things, even if it is to simply hunt them more efficiently. This is one of the major differences between Lupine and Lycanthropes; Werewolves are generally feral engines of destruction, whereas Lupine, while not as imposing, show more sparks of intelligence. Sometimes, especially curious individuals will leave their homes and wander, seeking adventure and experiences they could not achieve in their homeland. They can be found ranging far and wide, and, rarely, in the company of other races, who have refrained, for whatever reason, from killing the creature on sight and know the truth of its existence. Lupine also crave excitement, and any energetic or engaging activity that is sufficiently exciting will sate this craving. This is usually sated with hunting and physical sport, but in more civilized lands, bar fights, races, chasing thieves, running from guards, and delving into dungeons are enough to make them giddy. How Lupine view other races Lupine shun other races, but on the rare occaision nonviolent interaction occurs, their curiosity tends to get the better of them. They ask many questions, and can easily be engaged with stories of battle or hunting. Dwarves. I couldn't imagine living underground, never seeing the beauty of the pale moon. Perhaps that is why these sad, stumpy creatures are always in such a foul mood. Elves. You can't trust them. They will whisper beautiful promises of friendship to your face then slip a knife into your back the moment you look away. Halflings. Curious creatures, who want your treasures as much as you do. Be on your guard, but ask them many questions, for they have some of the most entertaining answers. Humans. They are finicky creatures who, for the most part, lead mundane and dreary existences devoid of excitement. I would pity them if they werent trying to constantly kill me. Lupine Names Lupine favor names that remind them of nature, night, hunting, and the moon. Lupine Traits Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2 and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Matured by 16 years, with a lifespan of up to 100 years. Alignment. Lupine tend towards Chaotic Evil, but those following Moonborn doctrine, and especially those that leave their homes to adventure, tend towards Neutral or Chaotic Neutral. Good Lupine are not unheard of, but tend toward Chaotic Good and are exceedingly rare. Size. Lupine stand almost 7 feet tall fully erect, and a healthy adult can weigh up to 260 lbs. There is little difference in height and weight between genders. Your size is medium. Speed. Lupine are extraordinary runners, able to drop to all fours when necessary to sprint with extreme speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet, but you may use a bonus action to move an additional 10 feet during your turn. Vulnerability: Radiant. Regardless of their alignment, Lupine are inherently born of darkness, and the power of purity is especially harmful to them. Darkvision 60 ft. Lupine are adept nighttime hunters, retaining their keen eyesight in even complete darkness. Natural Weapon: Claws. Lupine have razor sharp claws they use to apprehend prey and tear it apart if it resists. These weapons deal 1d6 slashing damage, and lupine have proficiency with their use. They have one set of claws on each hand. Pack Tactics. Lupine hunt in groups, and know how to use their prey's disorientation at defending itself against multiple foes to their utmost advantage. The Lupine adds 1 to attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of one of its allies. Keen senses. Lupine have sensitive ears and noses, and have proficiency on perception. Cursed Resilience. Lupine hides retain a glimmer of their ancestral resiliency, and when they take piercing or slashing damage from non magical weapons that aren't silvered, they reduce this damage by 1. This damage reduction increases to 2 at 5th level, 3 at 11th level, and 4 at 17th level. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan."

Like their parents, they retain the curse of Lycanthropy, with several critical differences. First, the curse is not as pronounced. Many of the immunities and strengths true lycanthropes enjoy are not available to Lupine, but by the same right, many of their weaknesses and flaws are also mitigated. Lupine are locked in hybrid form permanently, but do not lose control of themselves on a full moon. Full moons are compelling to them, but they can simply choose not to act on the aggression it encourages. Few, however, do. Lupine are generally as hateful and bloodthirsty as their parents, but thankfully, such fits of aggression are not a major threat beyond the damage the lupine itself can inflict. They cannot spread the curse of lycanthropy any longer, but they cannot be cured of it either. The form they were born with is the form they are stuck with permanently. Moonborn Lupine generally form communities far from civilization, usually in preferred hunting grounds. They take care not to disturb any settled races nearby, lest those races find out their existence and seek their removal. When they do disturb such settlements, it is always in the dead of night, in perfect stealth, and they take care to leave no trace of their passage. If they are discovered, one lupine may be offered up wounded as a sacrifice (usually the one responsible for their discovery), in the hopes the settled creatures will believe just the single creature was responsible, kill them, and assume victory. Despite being unpleasant and even violent, Lupine have a religion that teaches harmony with nature. This religious doctrine refers to them as Moonborn, and teaches the Lupine to give in to their carnal animal ways, to take pleasure in the hunt, that everything a Lupine does helps or harms the entire clan, and to bask in the glories of nature. It is everything primal, savage, and at the same time beautiful. Those who adhere to this doctrine tend towards a more neutral alignment, channeling their natural bloodthirst and craving of excitement into more constructive outlets that create a positive influence on their communities rather than a negative one. It also teaches that the Lupine are the true form nature intended, and the curse of Lycanthropy is actually the curse of imperfection. Thus, those who adhere to Moonborn doctrine also have a disdain for Werewolves, who they view as imperfect bastardizations of lupine form, driven mad and mindless by their own shortcoming. Lupine are extremely competitive, especially in all things physical. They take delight in being the best runners, the best climbers, the best swimmers, and the best leapers, and parade these accomplishments around when they can. Lupine strive for excellence in these regards, and respect any creature who shows considerable physical prowess. Even so, they respect cunning as well, for they know that simple strength is rarely enough. Strength is a tool, and tools are only as effective as those who wield them. Thus they also have a respect for creatures who use stealth or traps to bolster their effectiveness, though they have no special love for creatures who use it as a crutch to compensate their physical weakness. Wanderlust Lupine are curious by nature, always seeking to understand things, even if it is to simply hunt them more efficiently. This is one of the major differences between Lupine and Lycanthropes; Werewolves are generally feral engines of destruction, whereas Lupine, while not as imposing, show more sparks of intelligence. Sometimes, especially curious individuals will leave their homes and wander, seeking adventure and experiences they could not achieve in their homeland. They can be found ranging far and wide, and, rarely, in the company of other races, who have refrained, for whatever reason, from killing the creature on sight and know the truth of its existence. Lupine also crave excitement, and any energetic or engaging activity that is sufficiently exciting will sate this craving. This is usually sated with hunting and physical sport, but in more civilized lands, bar fights, races, chasing thieves, running from guards, and delving into dungeons are enough to make them giddy. How Lupine view other races Lupine shun other races, but on the rare occasion nonviolent interaction occurs, their curiosity tends to get the better of them. They ask many questions, and can easily be engaged with stories of battle or hunting. Dwarves. I couldn't imagine living underground, never seeing the beauty of the pale moon. Perhaps that is why these sad, stumpy creatures are always in such a foul mood. Elves. You can't trust them. They will whisper beautiful promises of friendship to your face then slip a knife into your back the moment you look away. Halflings. Curious creatures, who want your treasures as much as you do. Be on your guard, but ask them many questions, for they have some of the most entertaining answers. Humans. They are finicky creatures who, for the most part, lead mundane and dreary existences devoid of excitement. I would pity them if they weren't trying to constantly kill me.

So far my PCs have only gone up against humans, goblins, &amp; orcs. This coming session, they are going to face off against some more real monsters. I want to allow them skill checks to see if they identify the monsters they are facing and know their weaknesses. *The most critical question is how difficult should it be to know that a wererat is vulnerable to silver and immune to regular attacks???* I might also have a troll fight coming up and the same questions apply to knowing its regeneration and fire/acid vulnerability. Specifically I would love suggestions on: (1) What skill should they roll to identify a monster? (nature?, aracna?, survival?) (2) What should be the DC for just getting the basic name, and what should be the DC for knowing it's specif attacks, powers, &amp; vulnerabilities?"

We have the same group as my last campaign (which lasted a year and came to a nice conclusion), and we are doing a Cyberpunk setting! (Quite homebrew and uninteresting to some of you, I'm sure) But I have an idea for this almost omniscient hacker character that has powers over the technological world. The players (after the initial encounter - which is broadcast on television) are contacted by a lackey of this character. Now, in real life I am a cybersecurity major, and I actually know a decent bit about technology. I am going to drop a file to my party. I want it to be a longterm series of puzzles alongside the campaign, to try and incentivize my players to do some work and think about the campaign on their off time. Problem: The only issue is - I'm not sure if all the players will super enjoy it. One of the party members is semi-computer-illiterate, and so this stuff might be lost on them. I was thinking of having them roll ingame (or do research/side quests) to get hints to make it easier, but I'm not sure if that spoils it or not. Also I'm not sure if the idea of a long term puzzle that will take a long time to solve is a very engaging idea. Although, it will be pretty fun for me to make. Any tips, advice, or feedback about this? I'd love to hear your guy's thoughts."

A couple of DnD sessions ago I got the idea to create a DnD folder and accounts for all of the members in our campaign. Then I found out I could install a collaboration suite on it, and now we have a way to update our community loot table all at the same time. I have stored digital copies of books there, which can be opened and viewed straight from the NAS. I think it's quite useful as one of our members was semi-recently stationed in Korea, and he met someone there that joined our campaign as well meaning 1/3 of our members are half way around the world. Does anyone else have something similar set up, and does anyone have recommendations for what else I can use the NAS for as far as DnD goes? My career is Cybersecurity (policy side), so I am having a lot of fun doing some more technical stuff as a hobby."
