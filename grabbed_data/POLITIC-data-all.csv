Since the 1960s, neoclassical economists have legitimized the regulation and collectivization of this sector under the term ""market failure."" This assumption forms the foundation of the discipline of health economics and its attempt to replace the failed market using econometrics. In addition to widespread ethical principles such as equality of access and solidarity, health economics legitimizes collectivist state intervention for the development, maintenance, and regulation of national healthcare systems. The threat of government failure is to be averted by health policy interventions, and health economic models and research (health services research, econometric cost-benefit studies, etc.) are supposed to inform these interventions. Health economists  so-called social engineers  in line with politicians, aim at technocratic management of healthcare systems and the associated political discourse. The consequences are far-reaching: compulsory insurance, price controls, and third-party financing of all services ultimately transform the entire sector into a bureaucratic form of economy. #### Characteristics of the Healthcare Sector Healthcare systems are mass-scale. Their development is unpredictable and their complexity unmanageable. The abandonment of market mechanisms of price formation inevitably leads to misguided incentives, rigid structures, and bureaucratization. Instead of the spontaneous order of the market, a chaotic web of unclear claims and quid pro quos emerges. Collectivist funding entails moral hazard and escalating costs, followed by centralist attempts at control, such as increasing regulation and arbitrary rationing. Health economic research aims at healthcare policy (i.e., politicians) and leaves a wide scope for special interest groups. The attempts at political control inevitably take on planned economic characteristics. Depending on the system, the role of the market is maintained in the residual form of so-called regulated competition. However, regulated competition is not based on the willingness of patients to pay, but on diagnoses (diagnosis-related groups) and price-controlled fees, which must be financed by third-party financiers (i.e., by the collective). As the number of providers increases, an expansion of volume and a focus on lucrative service fees inevitably result from this distorted competition. The discourse on system rescue conducted by stakeholder groups generally ends unproductively. Neither doctors, insurers, nor the general public have any interest in voluntarily deviating from their entitlements. The scope of healthcare services unfortunately remains unclear. The concept of illness itself is rarely defined. Also, academic medicine with its biopsychosocial understanding of illness contributes little to this clarification, since it remains vague about application and does not incorporate an economic dimension. Nevertheless, political discussions are based on a sharp distinction between health and illness, which is convenient. If a diagnosis is present, a so-called effective, expedient, and economic treatment is legitimized. The discussion is thereby shaped by an all-or-nothing thinking, with diagnosis as the clear signpost. Economists prefer to cite examples of simple reparative interventions such as elective operations (hysterectomy, cataract surgery), rare diseases (""orphan disease""), and excessively high drug prices. Public health experts refer to rough metric data such as mortality and satisfaction surveys to measure and legitimize the mass system. Unfortunately, the view of the actual problems is lost: an entitlement attitude to something that remains vague, coupled with the problem that medicine as such is not an exact science. #### What Are ""Healthcare Services""? Healthcare services are heterogeneous goods and services that are available in different quantities, qualities, and combinations. They are not homogeneous, and nobody consumes health services per se. On the other hand, there is an equally large variety of providers, whose only common feature is a certificate from a university and a professional medical association, both monopoly organizations. Doctors are anything but uniform. One only needs to look at the growing range of specialist disciplines, subdisciplines, and special-interest certificates. What constitutes a ""doctor"" is not the result of market processes but a matter of academic and professional certification, usually by licensing monopolies. Furthermore, medical jargon and a guild-like organization (organized medicine) obscure the actual background and conditions of these services. Since healthcare services are already in the hand of organized medicine, the market is prone to fail. Instead of dealing with regulation and the right of equal access to this construct as a whole, one would do better to focus should on specific services and needs themselves. Do services as diverse as ear rinsing, kidney transplantation, and psychotherapy actually have something in common that requires collective regulation and funding? Are they connected at all, despite their appropriation by organized medicine? A generalisation of these highly diverse services under the guise of ""market failure"" is hardly helpful. After all, the term healthcare service remains vague and refers to a variety of completely different services and products that depend upon different types of knowledge and degrees of skill. #### The Doctrine of ""Market Failure"" The American economist Kenneth Arrow first described market failure in relation to medical care in 1963.[1](URL Arrow himself was a representative and cofounder of the so-called welfare economics and equilibrium theory. Equilibrium theory is based on the model of an ideal market, which can function optimally and efficiently only if certain conditions exist. The requisite conditions include the existence of perfect decision-relevant information (quality and price), homogeneous goods, consumer sovereignty, lack of externalities, and free market access. If these conditions are met, the market will be completely competitive, with supply and demand reaching a competitive equilibrium. It is a model that is based on mathematical derivations and leaves no room for the dynamic, uncertain, and ultimately entrepreneurial market process. If these conditions are not present, there is a ""market failure,"" and this supposedly legitimizes the state intervention. According to Arrow and current health economic theory, the conditions of the ideal market for health services and health insurance are not given. Uncertainties, information asymmetries, and supply-side regulation are too great. Some of the specific sources of these characteristics are listed here for better understanding. Uncertainty regarding: * onset of disease (coincidence) and efficacy of therapy * quality of diagnosis * necessity of medical services; patients cant know what they need * extent of costs * consequences of illness, including impairment of the personal integrity of the affected, and the potential loss of his decision-making sovereignty and income opportunities Information asymmetry: * the doctor's advantage in knowledge and experience Expected behavior of the physician is affected by: * principal-agent relationship: the physician advises the patient and thus influences demand * deviation from self-interest and profit motive towards collective orientation * treatment on the basis of objective parameters * trust and relationship element; no pretest of performance is possible Supply-side regulation: * licensing by universities and professional medical associations #### An Austrian Response: From Model to Reality Models are always abstract simplifications of reality. Scientifically this may be legitimate. The benefit for the real world is the more relevant question, however. The equilibrium model is based on mathematical equations and does not take into account the complexities of human behaviour and environmental constraints. Similarly, the entrepreneur as an actor in overcoming these obstacles is dismissed. In reality, markets are never perfect, but are in a process of striving for an optimum. Equilibrium is a state, but the market a process. The question, then, is rather: is the absence of a market, i.e., a state-organised healthcare system, better than a market with uncertainties? An all-or-nothing answer regarding the marketability of all healthcare services is hardly helpful. Further, to question marketability in a state of high supply-side regulation is comprehensible, but the latter is a consequence of previous intervention rather than a cause of market failure. #### Uncertainty and Information Asymmetry Uncertainties and information asymmetries are givens in markets. Lawyers, financial advisors, and career advisors all operate with uncertainties and information asymmetries. The client turns to them for lack of knowledge and experience. In the case of perfect information and certainty, such advisors  as well as the doctor  would be needless. In order to prevent the abuse of power by the gradient in competence, private markets allow for mediation through the obtention of second opinions, the availability of information from consumer protection organizations and rating agencies, or through guarantees. In trust-dependent professions, reputation continues to play a central role. Uncertainties only become a problem when they entail high, so-called catastrophic costs. Such catastrophes cannot be predicted for the individual, but in a large pool, they can be statistically predicted, which forms the basis of insurance. Shopping for medical services with uncertainty and information asymmetry is frowned upon. The patient is supposed to be incompetent to decision-making in that state. Still, doctors use comparable standardized approaches to diagnose and treat illness. Hence, the costs somewhat comparable. What a patient needs is to some degree subject to a learning process similar to those that occur with the other purchases. Consumer sovereignty takes experience. On the other hand, a doctor who abuses his competence might risk his reputation. With widespread information available nowadays, it has become possible to compare diagnostic and therapy costs for moderate cases of illness. Is it unthinkable to privatize treatments such as iron deficiency, wound treatment, asthma, or colds? Especially with recurring conditions, its hard to frown upon a responsible approach to private diagnostic services. The embedding of all healthcare services in a third-party financed healthcare system with exclusive handling by highly specialized MDs  the medical training takes at least twelve years in Switzerland  enforces a quality standard which is probably more luxurious than what a cost-conscious consumer would opt for voluntarily. Arrow aptly described key elements of applied medicine but, as with the idea of a perfect market, the rationale he uses tends towards all-or-nothing thinking: for every form of medical consultation there is such a gradient of knowledge, skill, and vulnerability that the patient always seems at the mercy of the doctor. The patient is therefore always incapable, never able to judge, and always at risk due to illness. He is apparently not in a position to acquire knowledge and experience and learn to make independent decisions. On the other hand, the physician is attributed a standardized medical competence. But in reality there is no constant in that, either. Apart from acute and distinct situations, treatment styles can vary a lot. The variety of medical special-interest certificates is proof of this. Likewise the abandonment of the profit motive is an ideal-typical conception, which is not durable in reality. Also, diseases are not always coincidental. A large part of chronic diseases can be traced to unfavourable behaviour. [Around 80 percent of direct healthcare costs in Switzerland are caused by non-communicable diseases](URL (NCDs, cardiovascular diseases, diabetics, cancer, and respiratory and musculoskeletal diseases). Estimates suggest that more than half of NCDs could be avoided or at least delayed with a healthy lifestyle. Chronically ill people therefore contribute in part to their diseases. They are not just victims of chance. Hence, the trade-off in these cases is always individual, (e.g., lifestyle change or insurance-funded drug?). In addition, healthcare may cause illness opportunism or ""morbid gain,"" in which people identify with illness and avoid responsibilities. In such cases treatments even have an illness-promoting effect. Would patients rather seek empowerment when they are biased by insurance-related moral hazard or in a free market? Health literacy is the choice of the individual. After all, he is the expert on his perception and behaviour, and in this regard exhibits asymmetric information vis--vis the doctor. The characteristics of unambiguously limited decision-making apply predominantly in acute illnesses and severe mental illnesses with a high degree of urgency. Unfortunately, health economic theory utilizes these rather extreme cases and extrapolates them to analyze all healthcare services. Patients thus get the impression that they cannot become masters of their health. This is tragic, since they have a lifetime to learn and shop for the best options instead of becoming subjects of learned helplessness, guided by the welfare state and organized medicine. #### The Behavior of the Doctor The problem of uncertainty regarding the onset of disease and the effectiveness of therapies is a reality. Limited decision-making sovereignty and personal vulnerability characterize the patient. Dealing with this is characteristic of the medical profession. Thus the physician advises the patient in his interest (""principal-agent"" relationship) and adheres to a profession-specific medical ethic in his own interest. This is precisely what distinguishes him from a salesman and is intended to prevent abuse of power. However, state licensing of the medical profession has made such a distinction needless. Trust no longer arises from ethical and thus economically appropriate action, but from the passed state examination and subsequent professional certification. The state-subsidized certificate thus stands in for reputation. The excessive length of training prescribed by the state and professional associations creates the impression of unattainable competence in the eyes of the patient. The elimination of price differentiation through widespread price controls decouples quality from pricing. Detached from the willingness of patients to pay, prices will always yield to highest quality, e.g., specialist and academic, certification. Thus competition happens only on a quality level and inevitably moves towards higher specialization. The more proof of certification, the higher the quality. The gap between doctor and patient thus continues to widen. For the patient, however, the significance of certificates is unclear and the certification system itself remains opaque, as it does to many a doctor. Since the physician as a person of trust is concerned about his reputation, he has hardly any incentives to abuse his power. But if he is insulated from the patient's willingness to pay and becomes a monopolist through high barriers to entry (such as compulsory licensing) or insurance contracts, the patient is truly at his mercy. If the doctor mainly performs technical services financed by health insurance, such as radiologists do, the patient and society are at his mercy. The abuse of power is perfected. State examination has thus become a unique entry barrier to medical monopoly and prestige. The temptation of medical prestige, a monopoly position, and income guarantee is reflected in the constantly increasing number of doctors. It is no longer the merit to the patient that counts. No. By price and service regulation medicine was detached from merciful achievement. Only the right to preserve vested rights remains. Although technical progress has reduced uncertainties, e.g., in the form of more precise diagnostic techniques, technical examinations have remained in the hands of doctors. The extent to which a doctor who only carries out technical examinations continues to be a doctor has never been questioned. Consequently, since technical procedures are not property of organized medicine, they may undergo a process of commodification leading to higher productivity and lower prices. E.g., allergy testing is not a medical service but a technical procedure separate from the consultation of an MD. #### Conclusion The idea of market failure originates in a highly abstract economic model. The discrepancy between the model and the real world is too great to allow markets to work. The assumptions it contains end up denying the marketability of all healthcare services in practice. But isn't this discrepancy more a problem of the model than the real world? Looking closer at the specific assumptions of market-failure theory, we find errors such as all-or-nothing thinking, overgeneralization, vagueness, and the confounding of cause and effect, as in supply side-regulation. Looking further at socialized medicine, we find that the neoclassical market model is not very helpful in real life, since bureaucratization of all healthcare services leads to a sluggish, rigid, mass-scale system, which cannot adapt to the needs of the patient and becomes subject to abuse by special interest groups. Furthermore, the adherence to state-subsidized licensing monopolies and the guild-like structure of organized medicine cements patient dependencies and capitalizes on them in an unfavorable way. Omitting market-failure doctrine and the preservation of vested rights leads us to the question of which services are marketable and how and where social welfare is appropriate. The patient's maturity and ability to judge and take responsibility will play a greater role. Ultimately, this assessment is a central task for physicians. E.g., a psychotic patient certainly cant choose whats best for him. A final answer to the question of marketability is therefore not possible. From a praxeological point of view, health is a desirable goal and a constant learning process. The challenge, therefore, is always how to empower the patient and conceptualise medicine outside the structure of organized medicine [URL"

In addition, recent congressional hearings have highlighted the extreme levels of violence faced by members of Americas ethnic immigrant communities at the hands of gangs, such as MS-13, due to border security and immigration law enforcement failures. Nevertheless, mayors of Sanctuary Cities continue to shield illegal aliens  and the foreign criminals and terrorists among them  from detection, with some now filing lawsuits against the Trump administration in response to Attorney General Sessions intentions to cut funding to those cities. Those mayors want federal funds but blithely refuse to assist the federal government in enforcing immigration laws that are key elements of national security and public safety. NBC News in Chicago recently reported, [Chicago Sues Justice Department Over Efforts to Deny Funding to Sanctuary Cities](URL That lawsuit and the statements of Mayor Rahm Emanuel reported on in that article. rise to a level of chutzpah that far and away surpasses the traditional example of chutzpah: the young man who, having been convicted of the murder of his own parents pleads for mercy at sentencing because hes an orphan. Sanctuary Cities should actually be referred to as Magnet Cities because they attract illegal aliens and the transnational criminals and fugitives and international terrorists to live in ethnic immigrant communities endangering the lives of those very same immigrants Sanctuary mayors claim they want to protect. Additionally Third World illegal alien workers have Third World expectations of wages and working conditions, creating a race to the bottom for all workers who face illegal and immoral competition from those illegal aliens. Americas borders immigration laws have nothing to do with race, religion or ethnicity. Where border protection is concerned, the aptly named CBP (Customs and Border Protection) has an annual budget in excess of fourteen billion dollars and employs more than 60,000 people Including Border Patrol agents who are charged with interdicting smugglers/human traffickers and their illicit cargo of smuggled aliens and contraband that evade the inspections process at ports of entry. CBP Inspectors are responsible for enforcing and administering our immigration and customs laws at ports of entry. Where aliens are concerned, That vital inspection process is guided by [Title 8, United States Code, Section 1182](URL which enumerates the categories of aliens who are to be excluded. Among these classes of excludible aliens are those who suffer from dangerous communicable, diseases or extreme mental illness as are convicted felons, human rights violators, war criminals, terrorists and spies. Although Immigration anarchists refer to aliens who run our nations borders as entering the United States Undocumented in reality they enter the United States *without inspection*. This creates an obvious threat to national security and public safety. Aliens who evade the inspections process are violating serious federal laws and, if that alien had been previously deported and has been convicted of committing serious crimes may face up to 20 years in prison. The relevant section of law is [Title 8 U.S.C. 1326  Reentry After Deportation (Removal)](URL It is noteworthy that the crime of Reentry After Deportation is the most frequently prosecuted violation of federal law. On a personal note, this is especially satisfying to me, I approached Senator Alphonse DAmato in the early 1980s to convince him to create the separate crime of unlawful reentry by criminal aliens with a maximum penalty of 20 years of incarceration. [The 9/11 Commission Staff Report on Terrorist Travel](URL detailed numerous failures of the immigration system that enabled terrorists, and not only the 19 hijackers who participated in the terror attacks of September 11, 2001 but many others as well, to enter the United States and embed themselves as they went about their deadly preparations. The preface of that official report began with this paragraph: &gt;It is perhaps obvious to state that terrorists cannot plan and carry out attacks in the United States if they are unable to enter the country. Yet prior to September 11, while there were efforts to enhance border security, no agency of the U.S. government thought of border security as a tool in the counterterrorism arsenal. Indeed, even after 19 hijackers demonstrated the relative ease of obtaining a U.S. visa and gaining admission into the United States, border security still is not considered a cornerstone of national security policy. We believe, for reasons we discuss in the following pages, that it must be made one. Page 54 of this report contained this excerpt under the title 3.2 Terrorist Travel Tactics by Plot. &gt;Because terrorist operations were not suicide missions in the early to mid-1990s, once in the United States terrorists and their supporters tried to get legal immigration status that would permit them to remain here, primarily by committing serial, or repeated, immigration fraud, by claiming political asylum, and by marrying Americans. Many of these tactics would remain largely unchanged and undetected throughout the 1990s and up to the 9/11 attack. Thus, abuse of the immigration system and a lack of interior immigration enforcement were unwittingly working together to support terrorist activity. It would remain largely unknown, since no agency of the United States government analyzed terrorist travel patterns until after 9/11. This lack of attention meant that critical opportunities to disrupt terrorist travel and, therefore, deadly terrorist operations were missed. Sanctuary cities not only aid, abet and encourage illegal aliens to enter the United States illegally and remain here thereafter illegally, these cities also harbor them and shield them from detection by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). In so doing these cities are not only in violation of [Title 8, U.S.C. 1324(a)](URL but are also obstructing the enforcement of our immigration laws that are, as the 9/11 Commission noted, essential to protecting the United States against terror attacks. Mayor Emanuel and other sanctuary city mayors fatuously and deceptively argue that if police officers work with ICE that illegal aliens who fall victim to crime, or have important information about criminals, will not come forward for fear that ICE will deport them. This lie vilifies immigration agents, endangering their safety and undermining their effectiveness by discouraging illegal aliens and, perhaps others, from providing them with vital information to combat human traffickers, members of violent transnational gangs and international terrorist organizations. Although it is rarely, if ever, reported in the media, there are specific [visas that can be provided to illegal alien crime victims](URL if they cooperate with law enforcement providing a strong incentive for them to cooperate with police and other such agencies. This was a key issue at a Congressional hearing at which I testified in 2004 on the topic: [Pushing The Border Out On Alien Smuggling: New Tools and Intelligence Initiatives](URL Politicians who are truly concerned about the vulnerability of illegal aliens crime victims should order their police departments to work with ICE to make certain that these aliens are helped. Mayors who argue that they are protecting the Constitutional rights of illegal aliens, ignore the fundamental and irrefutable fact that illegal aliens have no right to remain in the United States in violation of our immigration laws. They should read the [CBP Mission Statement](URL For most crimes, the venue for the prosecution is determined by where the crime is committed. A criminal who robs a bank in Texas and drives to Chicago must be extradited back to Texas to be prosecuted. However, an alien who reenters the U.S. after deportation may be prosecuted wherever he/she is apprehended because the venue for that prosecution is determined by where the alien was arrested and not where he/she ran the border. The crimes of Entry Without Inspection and Illegal Reentry after deportation, are known as Continuing offenses. Such aliens do not magically somehow become less illegally present if they can get from the border to a place at significant distance from the border. There is no [inverse square law](URL where this crime is concerned. When police respond to a call that a bank robbery is in progress, they are certainly not told to not pursue the suspects if they manage to leave the bank before the police get there. Aliens who run the borders, not unlike those bank robbers, are fair game wherever they are caught. Furthermore, they *must* be caught because they violated our borders and our laws that are our first and last line of defense against international terrorists, transnational criminals and others whose presence is a violation of our laws and our nations sovereignty. Although known criminal aliens should be prioritized no illegal alien, even those with no known criminal history should ever feel safe from discovery, arrest and deportation (removal) to deter illegal entry. Additionally, terrorists and fugitive are generally scrupulously careful to not violate laws that would call attention to them- this is an embedding tactic the 9/11 Commission warned about. Politicians who support Sanctuary Cities must find no Sanctuary from voters on Election Day. from [URL"

Trump,1,3zsgdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/3zsgdu/idea_for_donald_j_trump/,2016-01-07 10:14:34,"Dear Mr. Trump, Securing OUR southern border is tantamount to domestic security and paramount to descent wages for AMERICAN workers. Your plan to build a wall between the United States and Mexico is a good idea, but such a wall would ultimately be rendered ineffective in accomplishing its primary objective of curtailing illegal immigration. As we all know, elaborate, sophisticated tunnel systems have been constructed and are currently being utilized and expanded by Mexican drug cartels. A wall will not thwart such efforts. To the contrary, a giant wall would drive more human trafficking underground while increasing profits for the cartels. Instead of paying individual coyotes, more Mexicans would turn to the cartels to reach the Land of Opportunity. An unintended consequence of the wall you propose is the paving of the way for a literal underground railroad INTO these United States. There is a better way, and frankly, you are the only man with balls big enough to implement what I propose. Lets build THE GREAT CANAL. As with all great undertakings throughout history, the initial steps will be difficult, but then again, if there is anyone in the world who can acquire the necessary land from Mexico, Mr. Trump, its you. The impoverished villagers in the troublesome, Mexican border towns will gladly sell you their land in order to make better lives for themselves. Appropriating enough of Mexico to create THE GREAT CANAL is a win-win for everyone involved. Due to the high volume of criminal activity in those areas, the land is not worth much at all, so you can buy all of it for what you would consider a very small sum of money. Imagine all of the jobs that will be created when you begin building the 8th wonder of the world! No man-made structure on earth even comes close to the magnitude of that which I am proposing. The GREATNESS of AMERICA would be undeniably restored in perpetuity. The best part is that THE GREAT CANAL will pay for itself within a decade and continue to make money for centuries to come! The Panama Canal is a pathetic, little, creek-varmint construction by comparison. Im sure your team will broker a deal to shut it down within a year of THE GREAT CANALs opening. You have the opportunity to create a new trade hub for the entire world, and at the same time, solve all of AMERICAs southern border problems! As a bonus, THE GREAT CANAL will solve a serious national security vulnerability issue. The U.S. Navys nuclear submarines have no way to quickly traverse from one shore to the other. Both China and Russia are constantly playing little games in the Atlantic and Pacific, and who is to say an entire coastal fleet couldnt be knocked out with a single, coordinated attack? The balance of war powers needs to be maintained in the air, on land, AND by sea. Having highly advanced submariner capabilities ready to deploy anywhere in the world from multiple southern ports would strengthen our strategic capabilities to a level never seen before in human history. From sea to shining sea, THE GREAT CANAL will be a shining beacon of AMERICAN power, ingenuity, brilliance and wealth. I challenge ANYONE to dream up a bigger, better, more American way to truly MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Sincerely, Archibald V. Ogdenstool 646-736-1779 archie.og@clovermail.net "

I'm here to share my point of view, and if it provokes thought, then perhaps my writing of this is justified, if even one person whose never heard much of this wakes up or reads further into the events happening now, and finds the truth they seek. This is political at the core. This is about the political arena transforming into the socioeconomic one world government of the future, and it's implications economically, dealing with sovereignty, and religiously. Regardless of whether you are a Christian, the prophetic events written in The Revelation of John the Baptist are shaping up to come to pass, in the form of the New World Order. Even if you do not believe in The Holy Bible, you should not want a cashless society with the end of freedom of religion, with the end of your country's sovereignty, with the end of your government having (at least some minor semblance) of control over their economy. When the cashless society finally arrives and all of the paper money is finally gone, and you use biometrics to authenticate everything, the Mark of the Beast is going to come, regardless of your religious or spiritual beliefs, regardless of whether The Holy Bible is true. As you can tell, I believe it's true, but even if I'm wrong, at the very least, the dark people in control of this world must be following that book like a blueprint. There is not going to be an uprising. There is not going to be any true resistance until it is too late to overcome as a system. There is not going to be a pre-tribulation ""rapture"". Those familiar with the Bible, I have a question for you that I hope will lead to more questions. How many disciples, how many believers, how many of those faithful, how many of those crying out for help under persecution for their beliefs...how many of them were ""raptured"" away? In many ways, the Bible is a story of tribulation, after tribulation, after tribulation, after tribulation, until the final tribulation. Establishment churches have invented the pre-tribulation ""rapture"" and made it a hollywood phenomenon with Left Behind and the like. - IT - IS - A - LIE - I don't have all of the answers, however, when you sit down and read the scripture yourself, and cross reference scripture yourself, and instead of taking that cross reference out of context, read at least the whole containing chapter, you will discover the plain as day description of the events, which is that the ""rapture"" occurs at the end of the tribulation, before the Wrath of God is poured out on this Earth. How can the Antichrist overcome the Elect if they have been raptured out of here? How can he make war with the Saints if they have been raptured out of here? I'm not attacking Catholics because there is only one Pope and every person in this world regardless of their title is equal before our creator and none of you are the Pope. There are a lot of Catholics looking at the actions of the Pope with a suspicious eye, seeking guidance and truth. The Pope is arguably the most influential religious figure in this world and he is calling for the unification of religions. He is participating in acts of worship of other faiths, bridging the gaps between religious leaders. I'm not against religious peace, what am I against is twisting the Word of God to pervert the faith of those following you, which is exactly what many of these world religious leaders are doing, the most reknown being the Pope. As 2016 begins, there is talk of global recession and depression. I'm not saying all of this is coming to fruition now, I'm saying you can see the writing on the wall that some time in the future, it finally will be a global financial meltdown. Things are not getting better in this world, financially, governmentally, or religiously. You can't borrow your way out of debt, world. Governments when left to their own devices wind up being tools of evil men which are opposed wholy to freedom. You can't rely on tyrants to protect you from tyranny, world. You don't participate in your government, and your government has crossed you out of the equation when it comes time to count the votes. In all reality, even if your vote did count, it never really did, because no one who makes it to the final election isn't play ball with the New World Order, and if they aren't, economic hitmen from the global bankers will be visiting them soon to subvert them into the global debt system or assassinate them if they persistently resist. Religious leaders are going against their doctrines and becoming no more than Pharisees. You can't find spiritual guidance and providence by placing your faith in false teachings, world. Whether it happens in this generation, or in the next few, or far in the future, the time of freedom, truth, and choice are coming to an end. There is no stopping it. The only question is, what are you going to do? How long can we stop it from coming to fruition? Do you really want to trust your entire legal existence to a single chip that can be turned off for __________? With every passing year, whatever your intuition filled in that blank with will become one point on a growing list of offenses that are punishable by societal exile in the form of having your chip turned off. If you don't trust your federal government, how will you trust a world government, when your tyrant in chief is even further removed from your sphere of influence, and further entrenched in their seat of power? When your life is threatened for your faith, where will your strength of heart be? Will you be ready, or caught off guard? Will you have the presence of mind to realize that this life is temporary, but it rammifications last an eternity, or will worries of the flesh corrupt your judgment and lead to you being deceived? What kind of existence could you hope to enjoy in a world where your death is only as far away as speaking your mind? I don't want to live in that world, and if I have to, I'm not going to go along with it. I'll survive as long as I can and help as many people as I can, and one day I'll die standing for what I believe in before I live on my knees worshipping the death of humanity. If you're counting on being raptured away to victory before the battle even starts, what a rude awakening you would be in for when you realize the full gravity of your situation. How convenient would it be for the great deceiver to catch you off guard, unprepared, in a position of weakness and vulnerability. Not just unprepared materially, or financially, but spiritually unprepared. Not just spiritually unprepared, but unprepared in all of these ways. It sounds like a perfect storm to me, and the Bible says that even the elect are not above being deceived by that which is to come. If you are not religious, I would think that you are looking for answers, or open to new possibilities since your mind isn't made up. To you, I would ask you to look at the actions moving us towards the New World Order, the people at it's lead, and what they believe in. Again, I do not have all the answers and I am always searching for the truth, however, what I have to share this evening is what I believe to be the truth, and what I hope to spur thought in the minds of others who seek the truth."

9,cybersecurity,POLITIC,Theory: US Intelligence Is Behind Email Leaks Due to Clinton Security Compromises. This Is Why Clinton is Threatening Russia and Iran with War in a Blind Bluff Putting Intelligence Operatives On the Front Line.,4,51rsu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/51rsu1/theory_us_intelligence_is_behind_email_leaks_due/,2016-09-09 01:16:45,"""Screw with me and I'll start WWIII."" - HR(C) Full Theory from Comments: &gt;Her server contained SAC intelligence which usually contains names and locations of intelligence operatives working in hostile nations. This was confirmed by James Comey during his FBI testimony. &gt;That means that CIA/DIA/NSA operatives had their livelihoods and covers, and safety, compromised. &gt;This is why the NSA wouldn't issue her a government Blackberry, and she had to buy (13 of) her own, because they were being connected to an insecure server. &gt;It would follow that our intelligence agencies were long aware of her server's vulnerabilities. And it would also follow that they would have gained access to her emails, at least the NSA would have. It's in their own job description to test our own nations cybersecurity and you do that by penetration testing. So it would make perfect sense that the CIA/DIA/NSA were long aware of the kind of Top Secret information that was being compromised, and why the Pentagon decided to stop giving the State Department under Hillary information regarding upcoming drone strikes. &gt;So my theory is that the intelligence organizations of the US are trying to keep her from being POTUS as she has already compromised their operative's safety. &gt;There's a long history of domestic intelligence agencies interfering with US elections. &gt;Which is why Hillary is responding with dangerous threats of military response to nations like Russia and Iran. That puts our field agents right in the crossfire as those are the first targets of hostile intelligence agencies."
10,cybersecurity,POLITIC,Petition - Repeal CISA! The recently passed Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act is a dangerous piece of privacy destroying legislation on par with the Patriot Act,8,3znrbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/comments/3znrbl/petition_repeal_cisa_the_recently_passed/,2016-01-06 13:53:46,"This is a ""We The People"" petition to repeal CISA. Please sign here: URL Just before the end of December, Congress passed and Obama signed into law the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA). This law was buried deep in a must pass budget bill (on page 1728 of a 2000+ page budget bill). This law has some deeply disturbing privacy consequences, on the same level as the Patriot Act. CISA originally contained a number of protections to prevent its abuse, but they were all striped out before passage. I have created a ""We The People"" petition on whitehouse.gov to hopefully make our distress about this concerning bill made known to the government and hopefully start the wheels turning on getting it repealed. Please sign this petition and share with all your friends! URL More information on CISA and its disturbing consequences can be found at the following sources: URL URL URL URL"
