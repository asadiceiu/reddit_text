Im new to this, so if you are going to message me, please dont take advantage of my naivety. I am a smart cookie and can smell a liar a mile off. I want to find a caring daddy, who is tender, yet firm. Someone to discuss the dynamic with before we dive in. I want attraction, physically and personality. Im not sure I fully regress, but I definitely feel a lot smaller when we explore my vulnerability. There are a few kinks we can discuss that coincide with the DDLG dynamic, that Im happy to discuss. I am open and do not judge a person on their kinks. So Im 34, but I look younger, most guys say my eyes do something to them. I like to use them to my advantage. Hehe. Lets talk, tell me about yourself and dont be scared to send a selfie, I will send one back."

I should start by saying that I am ultimately looking for an in person relationship. I am not really interested in an online only arrangement, unless the end goal is to eventually meet. You can find pictures of me in my post history - they were all taken within the past few weeks / months. If you do decide to respond, please send me a *private message, not a chat request* (**I do not have chat enabled, so if you send a chat request I will not receive it**) and please include a photo(s) of yourself in your message so I know who I am talking to - it's only fair. &amp;#x200B; **A bit about me:** I prefer seeing the world as though I am seeing it for the first time; it's hard work, but that is what I aspire to - that sense of awe and wonder. Maybe I live in an idealized fantasy world, I don't care; I much prefer that to being cold and hard and bitter. I trust freely and I am a hopeless romantic, but I am not naive. I am a nurturing and empathetic Daddy; fair but stern when I need to be. I'm old fashioned in many ways and believe in being a gentleman. I do the right thing, even when no one is watching and having integrity is important to me. I thrive best in relationships where I can offer guidance and experience, I don't tend to mesh well with those who already think they know everything. That said, I do not know everything and I can admit that. I can also admit when I am wrong. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **What I want:** I would like to meet a sweet little. I am looking for a relationship first and foremost, with kink then built onto that foundation of trust. With love and support, I want to grow together and help you become the person you want to be while you help me become my best self too. I want to prioritize you and earn your trust and devotion. I want to be worthy of your admiration. I want to be with someone who can allow themselves to be adored and will prioritize our relationship. I believe it is a Daddy's/Dom's duty to elevate his Iittle/sub and look after her best interest. I understand that this process will take time. I do not want to rush straight into anything sexual. I do not want anything casual or non-monogamous. I do have a high sex drive but that must be earned. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **My hobbies and interests:** Consent, board games, video games, hiking, camping, D&amp;D, cooking, fermenting and preserving foods, lifting weights, urban decay, brewing, vulnerability, making nerdy things, riding trains along the coast, staying in haunted hotels, art galleries and photography. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **(some of) My kinks (negotiable):** &gt;!Impact play, bondage, role playing, D/s power exchange, orgasm denial, light breath play!&lt; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **My deal breakers:** I have decided to have a child free life - I don't want to have children and would prefer not to date anyone with children. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Random notes:** I am an introvert and soft spoken, but I talk really loud and get excited when I am interested/knowledgeable in the topic of conversation I have been saving clothes to give to my little in Animal Crossing Ron Swanson is my spirit animal Nudes right away are a turn off - but they're hot within the context of a committed relationship ;) I like to stay fit and take care of myself I am very much a liberal I am supportive of mental health issues, but please be willing to work on them Clingy / needy is great Morticia and Gomez are my relationship goals &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **You should message me if:** You enjoy feeling like you belong to your partner and he belongs to you. You like the idea of having a partner that is your best friend, too. You want someone you can rely on, who will go to the ends of the earth for you. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I look forward to hearing from you!"

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few.

I want to be very forthcoming on my hopes and desires. I crave both an emotional bond and sexual one. The sexual neglect in my life has pushed me to the point of hoping to find a woman who finds herself in a similar situation as me when it comes to intimacy and hyper-sexual needs. I am the man you see at the grocery store, at community events, or at the mall who seems to be very happy in life. My exterior shows such a kind and warm disposition. This is not an act or facade. I truly am a very compassionate and comforting man; however, there is a sexual beast present within which has my mind constantly racing with all the needs and desires I have in life. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar stage in life. You adore your family, and you feel comfort like a friend to your spouse, but your needs and dreams have been forgotten by all as you support and provide all those around you. There is a constant longing inside of you to be desired carnally by someone, to feel the heights of lust with another, and to be able to share your deepest secrets and desires with someone. If you reach out, please realize the vulnerability that comes with what I am hoping for. It's not for everyone to be so vulnerable with sharing pictures, videos, voice clips, video clips, and live voice/video chats. I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by hoping for these things. My desire is to allow both of us to feel care and satisfaction like never before, not be feeling like you are just being used or pushed to do things you don't want to. Even though I have an insatiable sexual appetite inside, my tenderness and care never leave. Physically, I am a tall, handsome, thick man. I am working daily now to conquer things that have held me back as a person, and me using food as a way to cope with sexual neglect is one of them. Even though I am a thicker man, the athletic build underneath is still there. I have very kind yet intense eyes, a warm smile, and a voice which will send pleasurable shivers up and down your spine. It's amazing how hearing someone's desire for you can be such an erotic experience. I am excited to make you my fantasy, so there are no body types which I crave over others. Your open personality, evident care, and excited attitude towards experiencing each other is what is most important to me. If you feel a connection to me already by how I portrayed myself and my hopes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am very available to chat while at work, and it just so happens I am at my desk now."

I'm looking to ultimately start a romantic relationship with someone. I'm seeking a partner who is communicative, honest and transparent. I've found that engaging with this dynamic requires a tremendous amount of vulnerability on both sides, so I'm ideally looking for someone who values and contributes to the facilitation of a trusting space. My strictest requirement would be that you'd need to be able to self-regulate. I am quite a supportive person and appreciate people who are similar in that regard but at the same time I don't want to become someone's therapist. I'm sorry but I'd be unwilling to start something meaningful with someone who is actively self-harming, for example. I'd rather not get into kinks here. Let's get to know each other and if we get that far we can talk about that to make sure we're compatible in that regard as well. I'm not looking to just jump into anything like that. I'd also prefer someone around my age. Attraction is important to me, and I recognise that this can be subjective. I'm happy to trade pictures at any point so we both know who we're speaking to. I'd also prefer you be in Western Europe and ultimately willing to meet in person provided we get that far. I'm aware I haven't given much to go on in terms of who I am, hobbies, etc. I'd rather leave all that to conversation as I'm for me the most important thing is we are on the same page about the above.

Once you get a taste of it you realize two things. There isn't another way to reach those buried and deep sentiments that makes you reach out to life. That shape you to attach yourself and find a meaning that is for no other to understand. A way someone can give their all, a naked soul without a shield to keep it hidden. The second reason is that once you get a taste of it you realize that there is no other way to live. If you are willing to open that door, you recognize that it is more than a dynamic, it's nature speaking. I want to bathe with someone brokeness, their mere open heart for what it is. I want to take that pain and love and make it my own. I want that despite the highs or lows the road may take us, I want life to be about us, us being the unbreakable law. I want to grow with someone, their truth as well as for them to carry mine. I want to face life and protect what is mine, shape what is mine to the version that will make them closest to me. But most of all, I want them close because I wish to love them. I want vulnerability as much as I want power. I want affection as much as I want possession. I want care as much as I want control. I want twistedness as much as I want passion. I want brokeness as much as I want truth. I want commitment as much as permanency. I want too many things that words will not suffice, and I want them all from someone. I am sure too that if you have come this far to read my letter you have your share of disappointments, but if you are serious as I am, if yous see what I see, if you feel as I do, if you haven't forgotten what it means to truly reach out to life, all I request is to hear it from your own words as I have done and I'll know you mean it."

17,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,"34 [M4F] Indianapolis, Indiana, Midwest (EST) - Are you also exhausted from hiding and burying a major part of yourself? Do you feel as if half of you is slowly fading away as you fight through indifference and neglect? Lets shatter our passion-less and neglectful worlds together.",1,ic3jes,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/ic3jes/34_m4f_indianapolis_indiana_midwest_est_are_you/,2020-08-19 01:49:58,"First and foremost, yes, I am seeking a very active, passionate, and interactive sexual connection with someone to include an over abundance of care, trust, and compassion. I want to be very forthcoming on my hopes and desires. I crave both an emotional bond and sexual one. The sexual neglect in my life has pushed me to the point of hoping to find a woman who finds herself in a similar situation as me when it comes to intimacy and hyper-sexual needs. I am the man you see at the grocery store, at community events, or at the mall who seems to be very happy in life. My exterior shows such a kind and warm disposition. This is not an act or facade. I truly am a very compassionate and comforting man; however, there is a sexual beast present within which has my mind constantly racing with all the needs and desires I have in life. Perhaps you find yourself in a similar stage in life. You adore your family, and you feel comfort like a friend to your spouse, but your needs and dreams have been forgotten by all as you support and provide all those around you. There is a constant longing inside of you to be desired carnally by someone, to feel the heights of lust with another, and to be able to share your deepest secrets and desires with someone. The type of Daddy I am is more along the lines of a tender, caring, and compassionate presence with an insatiable desire to please and be pleased. I have a very polarizing dichotomy when it comes to me being kind and guiding at the same time being devilishly and creatively wanting. I have not ventured into age play or little space, but the idea of developing tasks for you to complete for our mutual pleasure sounds like a great start. If you reach out, please realize the vulnerability that comes with what I am hoping for. It's not for everyone to be so vulnerable with sharing pictures, videos, voice clips, video clips, and live voice/video chats. I don't want to make someone uncomfortable by hoping for these things. My desire is to allow both of us to feel care and satisfaction like never before, not be feeling like you are just being used or pushed to do things you don't want to. Even though I have an insatiable sexual appetite inside, my tenderness and care never leave. Physically, I am a tall, thick man. I am working daily now to conquer things that have held me back as a person, and me using food as a way to cope with sexual neglect is one of them. Even though I am a thicker man, the athletic build underneath is still there. I have very kind yet intense eyes, a warm smile, and a voice which will send pleasurable shivers up and down your spine. It's amazing how hearing someone's desire for you can be such an erotic experience. I am excited to make you my fantasy, so there are no body types which I crave over others. Your open personality, evident care, and excited attitude towards experiencing each other is what is most important to me. If you feel a connection to me already by how I portrayed myself and my hopes, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am very available to chat while at work, and it just so happens I am at my desk now."

Once you get a taste of it you realize two things. There isn't another way to reach those buried and deep sentiments that makes you reach out to life. That shape you to attach yourself and find a meaning that is for no other to understand. A way someone can give their all, a naked soul without a shield to keep it hidden. The second reason is that once you savor its edges and deepness you realize that there is no other way to live. If you are willing to open that door, you recognize that it is more than a dynamic, it's nature speaking. I want to bathe with someone brokenness, their mere open heart for what it is. I want to take that pain and love and make it my own. I want that despite the highs or lows the road may take us, I want life to be about us, us being the unbreakable law. I want to grow with someone, their truth as well as for them to carry mine. I want to face life and protect what is mine, shape what is mine to the version that will make them closest to me. But most of all, I want them close because I wish to love them. I want vulnerability as much as I want power. I want affection as much as I want possession. I want care as much as I want control. I want twistedness as much as I want passion. I want brokenness as much as I want truth. I want commitment as much as permanency. I want too many things that words will not suffice, and I want them all from someone. I am sure too that if you have come this far to read my letter you have your share of disappointments, but if you are serious as I am, if you see what I see, if you feel as I do, if you haven't forgotten what it means to truly reach out to life, all I request is to hear it from your own words as I have done and I'll know you mean it."

This is my second post here now that it has been a while since I first posted. I learned quite a bit since then and had a lot of good conversations so I thought it would be good to post again now. DDlg has been one of my biggest kinks since forever, unfortunately however my experience with it has been exclusively online and I wish to change that hopefully soon! The kind of dynamic I fantasize about is a nurturing and gentle one. I'd like my little to be sweet, loving, and playful. I'm all of those things myself and I usually find myself naturally filling the role of a reliable and caring figure without even thinking about it. I'm really kinky too and completely open minded, so I'd love to hear about what you like even if it's not one of my kinks already! I also like when littles act a bit bratty or spoiled, I think it can be really cute and I'm also not afraid to get serious when the moment calls for it. The sort of little I like would be one who is really cutesy, childish, sensitive, and innocent, but also with a kinky/naughty side in private. I find traits such as shyness, inexperience, clinginess, and needyness really cute. I find any body type that isn't overweight appealing, with a preference towards petite/small littles. Race is not a factor at all for me so don't worry about it, I would however love to learn about your background since I really appreciate and like to learn about other's heritage and culture! I'm 5'9"", lean slim build, light olive skin tone, short/medium length straight black hair, and dark brown eyes. As a daddy I'm someone who likes taking charge of things and making decisions. I like to make sure my little is happy and comfortable every step of the way and always ask for feedback such as ""How are you feeling princess?"", ""Does that sound okay to you baby girl?"", ""Do you like this, cutie?"", and so on. It is important to me for a little to feel safe and be able to show vulnerability around me and I will make it a point to create an environment that suits that. While I am very gentle and affectionate I can also be very intense and have quite a voracious sex drive. That's why it is very important that I mention the need for my little to be sexual and that she have a sex drive that can keep up with mine. Intimacy is very important for me and is a big part of compatibility. For me sex is one of the most intense displays of love and affection and something that I can't get enough of with the right one. Some of my interests/hobbies: Music, art, psychology, science/tech, guitar, weightlifting, anime, travel, cooking, video games, computers Some of my kinks: DDlg, ageplay, breeding, oral, rope/restraint play, edging, teasing, and lastly, any of yours!(I really am very open minded and love trying new things! I'll be more than happy to try something you're into that I may not know of!) I'm looking for something long term, I want to form something special, deep, and intense with someone. The closer you are the better, I post this with the intention of making this a real thing! I look forward to hearing from you and getting to know each other. If there's anything you'd like to know that I may not have mentioned please feel free to ask! I'm very open and will happily answer whatever questions you may have for me."

No STDs is a must. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start slow and build up I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, we can talk more in person. But I am a film and music lover, take photographs, study art, architecture, love learning and always self-improvement.

33,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,25 [M4F] US - Desiring the submissive of a lifetime.,1,hlwc6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/hlwc6y/25_m4f_us_desiring_the_submissive_of_a_lifetime/,2020-07-06 09:10:24,"There is no denying that coming to this place we are both looking for a dynamic. But somehow that makes it easy, for most, to forget that at the core of any dynamic there is a relationship. It's easy to say what is expected of a Dom and a submissive, their twisted ways, cravings and what is anticipated of the power exchange. But what isn't easy is to be and own up to is yourself, role and other half when circumstances get serious or difficult. I've grown tired of games and cheap thrills. At the end of the day I want that one someone who I can invest myself into, who I can build with and who they can surrender for it to happen. I don't want the end goal to be questioned when the answer would be us. Every pleasing and uncomfortable memory I want to know that we are the ones who worked it through and the only question ever made was how is the situation dealt with to get to us. This time, I want to grow with and grow old with someone. As corny as it may sound, I believe there needs to be a since of attachment if not kneeling and the dominance force over it would be for nothing. Who am I? In the simple description, I am a twenty five old man living a simple life. I am someone who puts up with that simple life, bitterly, because I see it as a waste giving of myself if I know it's going to be for nothing. I believe in the right person and I won't compromise for less. I believe in traditional roles, its values and dynamics from what is expected of a man as a man and a woman as a woman, nothing can gain one on nature. But most of all I desire someone who can understand the sensitivity of power exchange. See many people live their lives not knowing what they are capable of, not knowing what they can or can not feel, what they should anticipate, not knowing what is buried deep inside of them. See when a Dominant takes control, it means you are his most sacred treasure, his greatest delight, his partner in crime and holder of all his sins. When a submissive kneels, it means a trust that can not be tainted, it means a servitude that can not be crushed, it means a completely surrender were she feels loved. It means the relationship itself is your ultimate law. In that power exchange I believe in discipline and punishment. I believe in the vulnerability it would take to trust, whether it is sentimental, physical, sexual, and as a way to push ourselves and build ourselves strong. I believe in intimacy itself and what it takes to hold it. I believe in pain and discomfort and how there is a light to it. I believe in being there for one another and building each other up traditionally, to pour ourselves completely into every little action. I believe to indulge in pleasures people would think of as sin, as simple as kneeling, as tender as petting you, and as fierce as restraining you for my own selfish needs. The thought alone of someone needing to take that pain to know she is doing her Master well, there is no better pleasure. To me that is life. If you are ready to take a choice that you can't walk away from, if you are ready to commit, if you are ready for this to be your last, I will want to get to know you."

When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. **If you want** to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. You need me to read you a bedtime story. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. **If you want** me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely.

If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. **If you want** me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely.

There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately.

In reality, i am making this post to express how im feeling in these recent times, as someone who is young, as someone who is young and now able to be openly present in the community, and as someone who could really use an apple juice ( on the rocks!) to calm down her nerves. I know most of you dont wanna hear my novel of bullshit, and youre more than encouraged to leave now. I suppose ill be as honest and bare as i can while im here. After all, i did make a throwaway account for this. Yes, the name hobbit dome was my first choice, and i happen to think its quite cool, thank you very much. Anyways, no shame from this point forward. Its not like any of this will matter in the long run. I am newly 18. About 16 days, newly 18, to be specific. Its a bit crazy to me how you can go from being a child one day, to being handed lottery tickets, cigarettes, and loans the next. It doesnt make much sense, does it? I would never smoke cigarettes, personally. I prefer to take a much classier approach to the freedoms my age has granted me. You know, sippy cups, wrist restraints, and finally being able to justify watching Dr.Phil. What a nightmare being a minor, and watching Dr.Phil has been. Ive gone from living in 6 bedroom houses to the grungey, lower class streets that i grew up on, and where i currently reside. My family has their ups and downs when it comes to wealth, success, and alcoholism, but in the end we always end up back where we started - cramped, left without, and wondering what its like to be on the other side. Naturally, my families neglectful tendencies left the children with some rather interesting personalities. One of us is a homeless druggie, the other is a self centered lover of destruction, and my inner turmoil manifested into a more contained idea, DDLG. Ive watched the community from the sidelines for the past 5 years, safely regressing on my own in the meantime. The moment i turned of legal age, because nobody acknowledged my birthday, i thought itd be my own gift to myself to finally set off into the online community of DDLG. I did just that, and to be honest it was way less impactful than a lot of people might wish for it to be. What i came across were lots of older gentlemen ( i use that word lightly with some of them ) offering to fly me away from my toxic home for a fun night with papa! I was also confronted with younger, newer daddy doms ( i use that term EXTREMELY lightly when it comes to every single one of them ) who thought cockiness meant dominance, and who were just too confident for the absolute lack of knowledge, experience, and ownership over the role they actually had. They might as well have been littles. They threw their emotions around more than i do. How dare they call me a brat! So, it led me to wonder, what do i want in this new world, and is it even worth it to try? I am new to a lot of things, and to be painfully raw, i am scared. Im scared of expectations. Im scared of not being good enough. Im scared of ruining every relationship that i have, because of my fear. Im scared of affection. Im scared of vulnerability. These are things that have made a lot of people turn away from me, or even be angry with me since ive talked to them while in the community. It seems as though they want me to be their perfect little from the moment they meet me, but i cant be that. I am flawed, I will want to pull away, I will do things that are not healthy as a person, but by all means, doesnt that give me so much more reason to pursue a companion who is as leading as a daddy dom? I am aware of my own faults, and they are exactly what leaves me desiring someone in this dynamic. If my heart were to speak, they would want someone who will not shun me for being clueless, wild, or lost, but they would instead tell me what it is that im doing wrong. They would grab me by my downfalls, and force me to face them, leaving me with the tools to grow out of them, and towards not always being the broken person that i was in the beginning. They would love that there are many places that are unknown to me, and take pleasure in being the first to give me so many beautiful things. Im getting tired so ill wrap this up. This is a personal so i feel its necessary to actually leave something relevant here. Me:  short, petite, frustratingly untamed black and golden curls  lover of the outdoors, bigfoot, and the smell of honeysuckles/pine  rather quiet when not spoken to, loves solitude after big bursts of energy, ideal situation is crowd surfing and then retreating to the forest for a hammock nap  a huge fan of being able to construct a conversation. i mean seriously. not just hey and wyd  very very very goofy. biggest supporter of not taking life so seriously. were on a floating rock people  little me is fireworks and stuffies all crammed together with craft glue and cheese crackers. She likes your typical little stuff. Coloring, dancing, and making a mess. Shes very clingy but knows when to retreat. She can put up a challenge but knows when to be obedient for the sanity of the other person. Overall, shes the coolest little thing that i know of.  I wont discuss kinks here bc at the end of the day, i like to try anything once. You: [ anyone can respond. im not jesus, and these arent the ten commandments. im just saying what i like. :) ]  Can make a joke. Can take a joke. Can tolerate stickers on the face.  is generally conscious of their health. A lil chub never hurt anybody, im just really scared of people dying  Absolutely knows what they want. Knows what they need. Knows who they are. Is educated and understands their role, and how to effectively exude dominance with ease. I widely accept older men for the reason of experience, but i love younger doms as well, as long as theyre not ignorant towards the community.  oh, and dont come at me full throttle with sex, and kink, and about how youre looking to add me to your poly couple living on the shores of Cancun. Before anything else, im just looking for friendly conversation. if all you care about is naughty naughty fun time then hit the road, jack. Alright, i cant hold my eyelids open. if you made it this far then youre an absolute maniac and i like you. I dont know what will come of this. Maybe ill leave the post to be a timestamp of where i once was. If i get any responses, advice, introductions, whatever it may be, i will read it all. i may get overwhelmed and decide to delete this all together and act like it never happened, but only time and my pride will tell."

Ive been into ddlg for around four years now, and Im looking to connect with a little living in PA, and to hopefully turn that into something serious. In the past, Ive had trouble finding someone who also works to be a reciprocating partner in the relationship, so thats been tough. I want a best friend first, and a submissive second. Im the lead singer for an art rock band, and I spend most of my free time producing my solo sfuff. Needless to say, musics super important to me. Hyper pop, glitch, and shoegaze have been some of my favorite genres recently! But that changes daily, theres not really much I dont like. I currently work at a library, and I love what I do. I also enjoy all of the arts areas a ton, and its important to me that a potential partner does to at least some extent. (Im a huggeeee A24 fan!!) In terms of the actual dynamic, Id like to consider myself a very caring daddy. I really enjoy all of the typical stuff: pacifiers, diapers, coloring, learning the names of stuffed animals, lots of attention haha, pretty much anything CGL. I can be fairly strict or more lax, totally depending on someones comfort level. For me, there just needs to be a mutual love of the groundwork set in place. The vulnerability is really special to me. Personally, I enjoy the dynamic being in place 24/7, albeit passively. Titles, rules, all that. But I definitely know someone cant be little all the time haha, the big side is just as important. Im also into most other kinks to some extent, but Im not very picky, and thats certainly not a priority. More of a general getting to know you point. On an unrelated note, Ive recently been getting more interested in being little for a mommy. Its something Id been interested in for quite a while, but I felt nervous doing so. The affection and care just seems so appealing, and Ive been wanting to explore. So if there are any switches out there, not a problem at all haha. To wrap up, Im a big talker, so I really appreciate investment in conversation, but who doesnt? Other than that, I guess I should say Im currently attending school for audio engineering while working, but my schedule is fairly nonrestrictive, especially with Covid in full swing. Although the possibility of an in-person relationship is a lot easier, I understand its not always feasible, and its certainly not a hard and fast rule for me. I just dont think I can do without at least some of this dynamic in my life, so I always sort of end up back here. Anyway, I hope to talk to some of you. Thanks for reading."

I like working out in the morning, befriending people, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take good care of myself, can talk your ear off about politics and weightlifting and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a master, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things. M/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time, and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a master, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 10 minutes of vanilla sex once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful m/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope to hear from you soon but until then have a nice day."

But this time I want to make it last and I want to live every day as if it were the first day that we met. I want to learn to laugh with someone, get to love again. I want to get to share those little moments and make a good simple day with you. I want to build habits that it's for no other but us to understand. I want to know those silly moments that come across, or that random thought you can't come into reason why it's there. I hope and want to share a sense of vulnerability with you that won't make us wary to get personal and serious with each other. I suppose you can say that it's love what I want, and that traditional girl. Yet here we are in this place that says there is much of a twistedness to us. There is a side to me that craves power as much as I crave a strong relationship. That hungers possession as much I want someone's all. That desires passion as much as sensitivity. That at many times wants to let and become diverted as much as perverted. No matter the high or lows we take, I simply want someone to take the roller coaster with, to be my ride and go places together. To simply be mine."

Ive been into ddlg for around four years now, and Im looking to connect with a little living in PA, and to hopefully turn that into something serious. In the past, Ive had trouble finding someone who also works to be a reciprocating partner in the relationship, so thats been tough. I want a best friend first, and a submissive second. Im the lead singer for an art rock band, and I spend most of my free time producing my solo sfuff. Needless to say, musics super important to me. Hyper pop, glitch, and shoegaze have been some of my favorite genres recently. But that changes daily, theres not really much I dont like. I currently work at a library and a warehouse, and I love the former a lot. The latters just a job haha. I also enjoy all of the arts areas a ton, and its important to me that a potential partner does to at least some extent. (Im a huggeeee A24 fan!!) In terms of the actual dynamic, Id like to consider myself a very caring daddy. I really enjoy all of the typical stuff: pacifiers, diapers, coloring, learning the names of stuffed animals, lots of attention haha, pretty much anything CGL. I can be fairly strict or more lax, totally depending on someones comfort level. For me, there just needs to be a mutual love of the groundwork set in place. The vulnerability is really special to me. Personally, I enjoy the dynamic being in place 24/7, albeit passively. Titles, rules, all that. But I definitely know someone cant be little all the time haha, the big side is just as important. Im also into most other kinks to some extent, but Im not very picky, and thats certainly not a priority. More of a general getting to know you point. On an unrelated note, Ive recently been getting more interested in being little for a mommy. Its something Id been interested in for quite a while, but I felt nervous doing so. The affection and care just seems so appealing, and Ive been wanting to explore. So if there are any switches out there, not a problem at all haha. Oh, and just because this has been an issue before, Im far left. If you havent been wearing a mask throughout this whole mess, Im not interested. If Trumps not such a bad guy, not interested. Im not trying to be exclusionary here, but politics and morality are the same thing in the current climate, and I cant base a relationship off entirely different views on right and wrong. To wrap up, Im a big talker, so I really appreciate investment in conversation, but who doesnt? Other than that, I guess I should say Im currently attending school for audio engineering while working, but my schedule is fairly nonrestrictive, especially with Covid in full swing. Although the possibility of an in-person relationship is a lot easier, I understand its not always feasible, and its certainly not a hard and fast rule for me. I just dont think I can do without at least some of this dynamic in my life, so I always sort of end up back here. Anyway, I hope to talk to some of you. Thanks for reading!"

My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start slow and build up I consider myself a pretty standup guy. Mentally strong and balanced. A bit romantic, emotionally intelligent, and understand what it means to be both caretaker, teacher, and disciplinarian I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, we can talk more in person. But I am a film and music lover, take photographs, study art, love learning and always self-improvement. Work in an important field to make the world a happier and better place. I love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. Please be HWP and no serious mental mental health problems If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start on vanilla topics. Thank you"

When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear.

There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance.

I found myself in a very sexless marriage very quickly after saying I do. This post however, is not about explaining the hardships which Ive had, but to reach out to a woman who feels just like me. Someone who is extremely kind, caring, compassionate, giving to a fault, but with an insatiable and creative sexual side which is almost completely unwanted or ignored at home. Yes, I am seeking a sexual connection where trust is developed to where we both can just express ourselves and be wanted, desired, and accepted for what we long for; however, I am also seeking a caring emotional connection to be able to get to the levels of vulnerability with which I seek. I am able to message almost all day from my work. Physically, I am white, tall, a little more to love but still athletic, and I have been told I am a handsome fellow.

90,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,"[M4F] Nerdy, sensitive 22 year old seeking a little who values communication, honesty, and vulnerability. Location: Palo Alto and surrounding areas.",1,hb7sxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/hb7sxz/m4f_nerdy_sensitive_22_year_old_seeking_a_little/,2020-06-18 14:43:50,"I've been holding off on dating for a long time now, and I finally feel like I'm at a point in my life where everything is stable. I have a stable job, a stable living situation, and I feel like I know where I'm going to be in the foreseeable future. It's time to begin the next major step in my life. What am I doing dating online? Surely you've heard horror stories or even experienced first-hand how rude and scary some people can be. Well, in all honesty, I'm extremely nervous about the concept of finding someone I feel comfortable with and then trying to explain the kind of relationship I'm interested in and scaring them off. So I'm here to look for a relationship where I know we can agree on some things ahead of time. **Requirements:** Everyone is entitled to live their life the way that they want to, and I would never dare tell you to change who you are. That said, there are a few things I feel that would make a meaningful relationship difficult from my end. Please be sure you can confidently check off the things below before messaging me. Like I said in the title, I value communication above all else, and I can't stress how important I feel that it is to be honest in a relationship. You *are*: - A woman - 18 - 24 years old - Living in or near Palo Alto (1-2 hour drive) - Not already in a relationship - Interested in all of the following kinks: DDLG, spanking, and diaper play - Able to provide simple verification that you are not actually a man trying to pretend to be a woman. (A simple photo of yourself in front of a mirror with three fingers placed on your left forearm is all I ask.) This goes both ways. I can immediately send you a nice photo my coworker took of me in return. You *are not*: - A smoker - A heavy drinker - Looking for a long distance relationship - Someone with body piercings (Again, everyone can live their life how they want, but it's my right and yours to like some things and not others). **More Details:** Well first of all, if you've made it this far-- I don't know what to say. Aren't I lucky? *Why DDLG:* I'm interested in DDLG as a relationship dynamic because I feel like it gives both of us an opportunity to be vulnerable and honest with each other. It's exhausting to keep a lid on our emotions and constantly refuse vulnerability. A DDLG relationship should be a safe place to discuss what really matters to us. A little bit of a side note on this: I feel like it's extremely important to acknowledge that the submissive partner in a relationship is the one who is in control. The dominant partner only has as much power or authority as the submissive gives, and the submissive can take it away at any time. I would hate to ever make anyone feel uncomfortable! *About me:* I'm a recent college graduate with a passion for writing, playing tabletop games (like D&amp;D), and playing video games. I also like to dress up in fancy medieval cloaks and run around the house like an idiot. I like playing pretend and getting lost in my imagination. Of course theres more to me than I can fit in a few sentences, but Id like to let them come up organically. **Conclusion:** I guarantee I am just as scared as you are about meeting anyone, especially since online dating can be potentially dangerous. I want to take things as quickly or as slowly as you are comfortable with. I want to take time to get to know the ""big"" you, confident that there is a ""little"" you I can get to know later on. If you'd like to chat, please DM me right here on Reddit and please be prepared to include a verification photo like described above within 24 hours. Thank you so much for your time!"

There is great amounts of negativity in the world, and Im hoping to help spread some happiness and care as well as experience some. My story is very common with those who were brought up in religious families. I met my SO young, waited for anything sexual until marriage, and got married young in hopes that the person I trust the most would enjoy exploring our sexual sides with each other. I found myself in a very sexless marriage very quickly after saying I do. This post however, is not about explaining the hardships which Ive had, but to reach out to a woman who feels just like me. Someone who is extremely kind, caring, compassionate, giving to a fault, but with an insatiable and creative sexual side which is almost completely unwanted or ignored at home. Yes, I am seeking a sexual connection where trust is developed to where we both can just express ourselves and be wanted, desired, and accepted for what we long for; however, I am also seeking a caring emotional connection to be able to get to the levels of vulnerability with which I seek. I am able to message almost all day from my work. Physically, I am white, tall, a little more to love but still athletic, and I have been told I am a handsome fellow. Personality and enthusiasm / energy are far more important to me than a perfect body. If you are tired of hiding, tired of keeping everything within and buried, and tired of never being desired or sought after for the sexual being you are, please dont hesitate to reach out to this HopingHoosier."

The primary factor here is docility. What attracts me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. **If you want** to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. You need me to read you a bedtime story. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. **If you want** me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately.

There's something that's so unique and deep there. I don't know if it's the vulnerability of the little or the compassionate role the daddy plays, but it makes for a connection like no other. I'm looking for that spark again. I've always felt that being a daddy matched my personality well. I don't like being overburdening. I don't like being mean or cruel. My favorite thing is having someone that I partially nurture and take care of; it's a very rewarding feeling. Obviously, we're adults--there has to be some boundaries. I'm looking for someone that can play the role of a little, but also be an adult at the end of the day. Maturity. Independence. The ability to work through problems logically and empathetically, and to take care of themselves. If you're interested and close (or open to something more online), shoot me a message. Thanks"

I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too!

Just a mish mash, ain't it? Anyhoo! About me! I'm a 35 year old he/him identifying person living in Illinois, practicing ethical non-monogamy and in a loving and long term relationship with my partner. I do want to stress, we date separately, I am not looking for unicorns, and each and every single one of our relationships are unique and amazing and great on their own and should never devalue any other relationships. I can discuss more about my lifestyle if you are interested in knowing more! So, a bit about me. I work in tech, am a giant freaking dork/nerd (love reading, writing, gaming - all kinds of gaming and more!) and am a huge fan of cooking, eating and traveling. All the usual things! Physically, I'm 5'11, chubby/Dad(dy) bod, brown skinned, short dark hair, glasses, neatly trimmed beard (with some grey in it now). We can definitely exchange SFW pictures if you'd like! I'm looking to form connections. Ideally, long term, intimate connections with tons of vulnerability and love and caring and support. I'm in love with love, with caring and supporting and being supported and just getting to know amazing, awesome people. I swing very to the left on the political scale, I love spicy foods and I'm just a big old nerd looking to love and be loved! Hope to hear from you!"

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please.

The primary factor here is docility. What attracts me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. **If you want** to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. You need me to read you a bedtime story. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes.

If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. **If you want** me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely.

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few.

I'm fun and like to joke a lot, but I also enjoy more meaningful chats and discussing ideas. I'm really into psychology, yoga and improv.

Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, we can talk more in person.

The primary factor here is docility. What attracts me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. **If you want** to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. You need me to read you a bedtime story. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. **If you want** me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this. Tell me about yourself in general.

Im a bunny and a unicorn and a princess and maybe more. I live in India and while I eventually want an IRL Daddy, thats gonna take a long time to happen in my city, and in the meanwhile, littlespace doesn't feel good without anyone to share it with, so I am looking for a short-to-long term, platonic-ish CG to talk to in littlespace. I am ethically non-monogamous but I want to build a strong, intimate connection. I am not looking for a full DDlg dynamic to start with. But if we connect really well, maybe we could explore that and other kinks. I am mostly a non-sexual little, but we can get to some sexual/age-play parts later too. Basically looking for somebody who might find gratification in making a little feel safe and in being adored (and teased) by them. I would love to get to know each others vanilla sides but I am looking for something primarily focused on our exploration of CGl and sharing all the love, affection, intimacy and vulnerability that can exist between a CG and a little. I would like to be able to text you with all my excited little ramblings, share all my made-up worlds and characters (do you know the difference between unicorn land and rainbow land?), tease and be teased back, be kept within lines when i brat, make you proud by being a good girl in vanilla life, watch cartoons with sometimes, and fall asleep with bedtime stories and stuffy cuddles. Ya know, the stuff that little dreams are made of. I am 5ft and smol and cute. Little me is around 3-5. I love cuddles, my stuffies (nelly belly is the softest, made of clouds!), cuddles, sucking my thumb, hot choco in my sippycup, putting stuff in my unicorn littlespace journal, cuddles, all things cute and pink, and cuddles! I can be a bit bratty. I show affection by teasing and I ask for affection by acting spoiled. But I dont brat in order to get punished. Timezone-wise, since I am in India, we would need to find some overlapping time between 8pm-1am and 9-11am IST. Both Europe and US might have this possibility. I would like to eventually move to voice and video calls. I prefer that you be older than me. And that you dont have any partners who would be in the dark about us. Okay now come say hi! Edit: Please do tell me about yourself and what you're like as a CG! Everybody sends 2-line replies so there's no way to tell who's compatible and I can't chat with everyone. Thanks. \-zee"

There is great amounts of negativity in the world, and Im hoping to help spread some happiness and care as well as experience some. My story is very common with those who were brought up in religious families. I met my SO young, waited for anything sexual until marriage, and got married young in hopes that the person I trust the most would enjoy exploring our sexual sides with each other. I found myself in a very sexless marriage very quickly after saying I do. This post however, is not about explaining the hardships which Ive had, but to reach out to a woman who feels just like me. Someone who is extremely kind, caring, compassionate, giving to a fault, but with an insatiable and creative sexual side which is almost completely unwanted or ignored at home. Yes, I am seeking a sexual connection where trust is developed to where we both can just express ourselves and be wanted, desired, and accepted for what we long for; however, I am also seeking a caring emotional connection to be able to get to the levels of vulnerability with which I seek. I am able to message almost all day from my work. Physically, I am white, tall, a little more to love but still athletic, and I have been told I am a handsome fellow. Personality and enthusiasm / energy are far more important to me than a perfect body. If you are tired of hiding, tired of keeping everything within and buried, and tired of never being desired or sought after for the sexual being you are, please dont hesitate to reach out to this HopingHoosier."

When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately.

The primary factor here is docility. What attracts me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. **If** you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately.

It somehow feels weird to say, but I'm an ""experienced"" Daddy Dom. I've had a few long-term DD/lg relationships, and by now I seek out that style of connection. The innocence, the emotional vulnerability, everything - it let's me feel so close to my partner! I'm looking for someone local that I can connect with in this way, to eventually spend time with in person. Preferably long term. My DD style tends to change depending on my partner and what feels natural DD/lg is nonsexual for me, so I'm not here just to find someone to sleep with. I'm ALSO very kinky and experienced in BDSM, and I'm open to sex / kink / etc play if we connect in that way too. But if not that's still fun - I'm very happy connecting with a Little who isn't open to sexual play. Cuddles are really nice! 28 6'0 Muscular build Attractive (can send photos if we chat) Poly Introvert Send me a message if you're interested! We're both stuck inside for a while, so lots of time to chat and get to know each other"

Just a mish mash, ain't it? Anyhoo! About me! I'm a 35 year old he/him identifying person living in Illinois, practicing ethical non-monogamy and in a loving and long term relationship with my partner. I do want to stress, we date separately, I am not looking for unicorns, and each and every single one of our relationships are unique and amazing and great on their own and should never devalue any other relationships. I can discuss more about my lifestyle if you are interested in knowing more! So, a bit about me. I work in tech, am a giant freaking dork/nerd (love reading, writing, gaming - all kinds of gaming and more!) and am a huge fan of cooking, eating and traveling. All the usual things! Physically, I'm 5'11, chubby/Dad(dy) bod, brown skinned, short dark hair, glasses, neatly trimmed beard (with some grey in it now). We can definitely exchange SFW pictures if you'd like! I'm looking to form connections. Ideally, long term, intimate connections with tons of vulnerability and love and caring and support. I'm in love with love, with caring and supporting and being supported and just getting to know amazing, awesome people. I swing very to the left on the political scale, I love spicy foods and I'm just a big old nerd looking to love and be loved! Hope to hear from you!"

204,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,34 [M4R] Online / Louisiana - Disabled nerdy Daddy / sadist. Looking for emotional and sexual connection. Do you want to be daddy's princess and daddy's toy? Let's comfort each other.,1,gaqnca,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/gaqnca/34_m4r_online_louisiana_disabled_nerdy_daddy/,2020-04-30 16:44:55,"I have a poly relationship with my current submissive. I am here to make some friends and enjoy quarantine time. I may be surprised by the connections I find. I live with chronic nerve pain. I can mention it and I can manage it. Looking for emotional support as I ride the daily waves of pain. I worked so hard over the past 10 years to get where I am today. Some of my kinks revolve around my pain. Being massaged and nurtured - also, ""sharing"" my pain with people. Seeking someone 18-30. Someone sweet with a twist. Someone to chat with. Eventually - Someone to cum with. Someone to send me dirty pictures and encouraging messages to brighten my day. I want someone who can eventually voice chat. We can encourage, support, and comfort each other. Start online. After the pandemic we can decide if we want to get together in person or keep things online. We do not have to line up on everything. I love discovering new things because I interacted with someone passionate about something. A willingness to explore, experiment, and try new things will go far with me. We are a great match - if you like to have in depth discussions - even about the things that make us uncomfortable. Let's go to there. Looking for someone to discuss all of our fantasies with. Someone who loves being vulnerable. Sexually and emotionally. I love to tease and deny. I love forced and multiple orgasms. I like exploring as Daddy, Sadist, and Dom. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I want to dress you in cute and frilly outfits. Every day can be a different shade of Halloween. Princess. Cheerleader. Schoolgirl. I want to make sure you look real cute while I do un-cute things with and to you. I love thinking about making someone my collared princess. Over time turning them into Daddy's little cumdumpster. Praise and affection. Degradation and humiliation. I want to guide and nurture you as you serve me. We will find that balance together. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or push them until we find new ones. I have many kinks and am open to exploring. Top kinks - oral / deepthroat, DD/lg, orgasm control, freeuse, worship, mindfuck, sissy, CNC, degradation, and ageplay. Limits - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, breathplay and choking. I am - 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I love people. Open to all body types. The more I like you mentally - the more I will like you physically. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. Weaving in and out of what we did and how we felt about it. I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am incredibly affectionate - I like touching the people I care about to remind them I care. Lots of hugs. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I will naturally reference songs during conversation. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs/RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, comedy, suspense, action - movies and tv shows. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. You are - Nurturing. Affectionate. Curious. Kind. Self aware. You love to listen. You have a thirst for learning and understanding. You have an open mind. You love, respect, and treasure vulnerability. You are emotionally and sexually intelligent. You are enthusiastic about life and kink. You are patient and like to explain feelings and thoughts in detail. We will have many discussions about so many things! Let's build an open line of communication. Accept each other with curiosity and openness. I want to get deep - sexually and emotionally. It is important to take time to build communication. Then see what happens. Together. Send me a message and let's start this adventure."

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

225,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,"28 [M4F] Toronto / Montreal, Canada - Looking for the clingy and needy girl that belongs in my lap",1,fjtjpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/fjtjpo/28_m4f_toronto_montreal_canada_looking_for_the/,2020-03-17 09:13:11,"When directed toward me, there are behaviours that, no matter how blatantly transparent, manipulate me; they speak to something inside me, gratify me, and invoke a clarity of thought and aggressive focus nothing else does. These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

I value emotional vulnerability and closeness in my relationships and am looking for someone who can hold this deeper connection with me. I'm a switch, so BDSM in my relationships can sometimes become very focused on only the sexual. This comes easy to me. I am looking for the deeper connection that BDSM also allows. I will be happy to share more of my sexual interests privately, but generally I enjoy a dynamic that is exploratory, open, and playful. DDlg being one kink that is very exciting to me. **A little about me outside the bedroom and relationships:** I'm a late-20s woman, who is self-sufficient and fiercely independent. I am fairly tall (almost 6ft), and curvy. I am ethically non-monogamous, but don't require my partners to be. I work a corporate job, while my background is the arts. I strive daily for balance and to hold my boundaries firm. **How I'd like this to work:** Please send me a message describing what caught your attention (""hey""s and ""still looking??""s will be ignored, as I am asking for something that is not that casual and ask that you respond accordingly). Respect and sincerity will get my attention, and in that case please be prepared to share a SFW photo of yourself, and I will do the same. Talk soon, worthy suitors :)"

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. However, I don't intend to keep you down; rather build you up. If you've read this far, then you know you need this. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username.

I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

But I feel like I put on this front for everyone, smiling, confident, and rational but inside I'm aching to just be loved. I don't understand why no one wants me. It feels like no one ever has, not my parents, or my foster parents, or my first love, or any infatuation thereafter. I was in one 3-month long relationship where I was being used for sex. I like to think I'm a very well rounded person with strong, positive morals (I'm Buddhist) and I'm not concerned with superficial things. I'm not argumentative and I'm really understanding. I'm philosophical and have a lot of interests and so much love to offer, but it seems like everyone I pursue never wants me back. Sometimes I'm up what feels like all night crying because it just hurts so badly. I never show vulnerability. I don't come off as desperate. I've been told I'm stoic and intimidating once, even. And it always seems like just once I've gotten someone to start to reciprocate, they find someone better or they don't want a relationship or they completely disappear without explanation. I don't understand it. I've been told I'm gorgeous, witty, fun. I've been told I'm perfect. But yet I'm still here, sitting in bed alone and wishing I at the very very least had someone just lying next to me. I have so so much nurturing to give and support and affection, but it seems like everyone I talk to runs for the hills when I want anything beyond sexual. I guess just want to be wanted for more than my body, just once. And to not have my affections rejected immediately and to not feel like my default role in anyone's life is not worth love, only worth lust. td;lr: I'm just so fucking lonely."

Part of me is a traditional man in the sense that I expect commitment, loyalty, genuineness. A side of not giving up on one another. Now the other side of me, the side that by now you know my little secret. I am a Dom who thrives on control and possession. Who takes owning someone to a literal extent. I want to have every side of my submissive. Her vulnerability. Her thoughts. Her comfort. Her need. Her joy. But most of all, her servitude as I take pleasure from having her in my life.

I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too!

A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that.

More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately.

297,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,47(M4F) - US/Online - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,ekl1zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/ekl1zr/47m4f_usonline_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just/,2020-01-06 10:35:48,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's.

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

In search of an ethical non-monogamous, feminist women, sex positive, gross, pain slut who has a twisted mind on par with mine! The deeper and darker your fantasies, the more I want to meet you.

Located in the south bay to Watsonville About me: Older Pervert looking for a pervette 6'3"" Top/Sadist geeky retro nerd goblin who works in the trucking industry. Hobbies: I can show you I'm tall, dark, and handsome, but interesting? I have to leave some mystery. That's the fun part about meeting a new humans. Vulnerability, emotional intelligence, trust, and safety are very important to me. I'm not looking for a quick scene on a friday night or to jump into a relationship head first. I need to know how deep the well is or we'll both end up splitting our heads open. Let's chat and get to know each other so I can pour myself into you and drink you from within. I require Negotiations and demand aftercare if we do end up playing. I have my shit together in my non- monogamy [egalitarian non-hierarchical polyamory] and kink life [Risk aware consensual kink], [not interested in TPE, M/s] , [D/s is okayish], [Ageplay is where I flourish most]. We all have our baggage and I will not unpack it for you, but that doesn't mean I won't help. I won't leave you dangling on the wash line like grandma's wet panties if times get rough. But I need to know if you can see how the panties got up there, and how to get them down before the wind blows them away. Ultimately this is mutually beneficial exploration and experience that will take our kinks and fetishes to new heights. Build each other up so high we may never come down. I try live by example and I take responsibility and accountability for my actions. I am human, certainly not perfect. I try to be the person I would want to meet at kink events. Generally I'm sweet, patient, loving, kind, goofy, silly, empathic, and I will love on you in public but I'll want to put my cigarette out on your arm and have you thank me for it. A fun night would probably involve plastic sheeting, I'll let your imagination run with that. Don't worry I'm not an ax murderer, but I can play one in the bedroom. I don't drink and I don't care if you do. Give me kisses and I'll buy you drinks. My sense of humor comes out in person better than written. Have you ever stayed awake at night thinking about the futility of life and how little and meaningless our existence is in the grand scheme of things? Hahahaha me either....... Do you need to be put in your place? I have the skills necessary to make that happen. Message me and I'll make your existance and body finally have some meaning and use. Fortune favors the bold.

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller (60) than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 21 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"

She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,eoa9gz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/eoa9gz/47m4f_us_estonline_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes/,2020-01-14 08:00:51,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a wordsmith, an occasional cunning linguist, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me; my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I cannot stress this enough, but I am not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person.

309,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,47(M4F) - US EST/Online - Still looking for that perfect (for me) sub!,1,erkvno,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/erkvno/47m4f_us_estonline_still_looking_for_that_perfect/,2020-01-21 09:28:52,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a wordsmith, an occasional cunning linguist, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me; my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I cannot stress this enough, but I am not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. I'm not looking to dive into D/s things very quickly. I prefer to get to know my partner outside of a dynamic first and foremost. **If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Also, don't send me a one-liner on Reddit chat, please. I need substance here.** Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please be sure to state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics  Thanks!"

The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to pick out your outfit. You need me to order for you at a restaurant. You need me to read a bedtime story to you. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and send a private message on Reddit with your username.

I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please be sure to state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics. Thank you"

348,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,47(M4F) - I found the perfect sub! She's just waiting to reply! ;),1,dvxnok,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/dvxnok/47m4f_i_found_the_perfect_sub_shes_just_waiting/,2019-11-14 07:23:15,"Hello there. I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (Way too much WoW lately) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), telegram, emails, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted. If you aren't interested in having deep conversations or in writing detailing responses, please don't bother to reach out to me. Include a name or alias that isn't your screen name, A/S/L, communication preferences, and precisely what in this post moved you to reach out. Thank you."

Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

Must be local and intelligent",0,dh3viu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/dh3viu/38m4f_nyc_mature_and_experienced_daddy_handsome/,2019-10-13 12:12:06," Long post, but detailed. Please read 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strive to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to read a bedtime story to you. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval. If you've read this far, then you know you need this and you will reach out to open up to me. Install the Telegram messaging app on your phone and follow up with your username.

I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste.

I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 19 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). I never last long on the more blatantly BDSM related sites with their blatantly sexual agenda and blatantly displayed genitalia (SO many questions about that) where people seem to gather to find casual play partners and hairy old dudes to tie them up and take compromising pictures and jump right into things that would take me a really long time to open up to. D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not a sub, but rather my sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you little one I hope to find you"

The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. I don't mind if she's gregarious or even aggressive. I want her to be comfortable with other people but not necessarily herself. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to help you carry something. You need me to walk you to your car. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I demand blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

The end result is companionship, romance, vulnerability, and a mutually beneficial power dynamic.

I'm a bit clingy- not in a way that will suffocate you, but you'll never need to doubt my devotion to you or if I want to be around you! I love phone calls and watching tv on facetime together. I'm monogamous, which isn't something that will change. I have one year left in college, and I work about 30 hours a week. My little age doesn't really go past 3. I have curly hair, I'm pale as can be, and I'm a pretty good /obedient girl if I do say so myself! My main kinks are abdl/ddlg/cgl, along with cnc, water sports, bondage, anal, forced orgasms, denial, and general masochism. I'm still very much exploring abdl though, and am hoping to get more familiar with it. I want a softer daddy for sure, who isn't afraid of emotional vulnerability but can also enforce rules. Height doesn't matter to me, because I'm short so everyone sort of feels the same height to me anyways! Body type doesn't matter either, as long as you take care of yourself- I'm pretty average build I guess- I wear medium size diapers, if that helps you gauge anything, and they're often a bit too roomy. As far as age goes... I'm not too sure, actually. I'm only interested if you're single- awesome if your partner is allowing you to explore or if you're finalizing a divorce, but I'm not the girl for you. Also not down with kiddos- don't want any of my own, and I'm not interested in a partner who already has them. Bonus points if you have pets- I have a cat, and am more than happy to share pics of her! I hate that I have to say any of this but: Please don't pop into my PMs with weird Super Ultra Domly Dom stuff- I'm a human, and you are too, so let's communicate like it!

Im 24, male, white, 59, average weight, queer, feminist, liberal, and work in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, reading history and nonfiction, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im very driven and am always trying to learn something new! Open communication is absolutely essential to me- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously. From my experience this mutual effort at communication is particularly necessary when kink is involved, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have a broad list of kink interests and experience, and I love learning and talking about BDSM and sexuality. If I were ice cream, I'd be a two scoop nurturing, guiding Daddy Dom sundae with sadistic sprinkles on top! I really like rules and training, positions, verbal responses and protocol. I crave getting into a partners mind, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more! As it pertains to DDLG specifically, an ideal partner for me would be a middle, as ABDL and age regression doesnt interest me, but I really like the fun, supportive DDLG dynamic. Im looking for a submissive female or female presenting fellow goofball in (ideally) the US Northeast/Rust belt area who is open to non-monogamy, as I have a long-distance partner. Online works as well if you're not necessarily tied down (heh) to your area long term. I need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have a power dynamic, so open communicators to the front! Intelligence, drive, an absurdist sense of humor, and emotional maturity are extremely attractive to me. Im also potentially interested in talking with couples who are looking to share dominance or explore subbing together. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, send me a message! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :)"

I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 21 years old and older is fine. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. This means meeting a few times a month to start and charting in between but not a deep emotional thing right away I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you"

Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in Sunny Florida and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I'm black, curvy, 5'4 I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me.

Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have any sort of kink-based dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I *am* one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand questions to satiate my desire to learn about you and how to make you laugh.  Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have experience with many different kinks and types of play, and love them all in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM and sexuality, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side, such as liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, verbal responses and protocol, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure over using pain.

Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. Just some smol things: - Please be 27+ - In the United States -long distance doesnt bother me There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl."

Lets hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can connect and grow with. A best friend to enjoy life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. We can start online or long distance. If things go well we can meet in person. I plan to live with a kinky partner. I have a house here and am likely to stay. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or switch. Someone to explore all of our kinks and fantasies with. And find new ones together. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. We can see and accept all of each other. Who am I? - I try to make the world a better place. I know how hard life can be. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I have stories and lessons to share. No one has to go through life alone. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Charming. Contagious laughter. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. Financially secure. Multiple degrees. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am open to all body types. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. Homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I love learning about different thought systems, pulling out nuggets of wisdom, and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew existed. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out. I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions with each other. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to think out loud. To wonder. Dream. Imagine. I tend to fall for people through nerdy conversations about passions. Lets get deep on something one of us cares about. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! Huge Disney fan! I have a weakness for accents. My natural southern accent is one of my strengths. I love talking on the phone / through voice chat. I am very silly. I love making people laugh. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love awkward humor. I love getting excited and enthusiastic about things. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path forward. I am kind. Compassionate. Empathetic. Emotionally intelligent. Nurturing. I like being the person that my friends can rely on. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very affectionate - if I like you - you will know. I love music. I have a thing for rap, rock, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero, horror, crime, sci-fi, fantasy, action, comedy, thrillers. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy laughing too loud at the movies. And going to the occasional escape room. I love reading every label in museums. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. I want to make sure I give things a try once or twice - within my limits ;). Who are you? - Passionate. Caring. Understanding. Curious. Nurturing. Affectionate. You love to listen. You like to laugh and play. You have a thirst for learning and understanding. You have an open mind. You love, respect, and treasure vulnerability. You are comfortable expressing yourself and your needs. You are enthusiastic and willing to explore the ups and downs of life. And kink. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Romance. Intimacy. Kink. With someone I can lean on during hard times. Someone to get deep with - sexually and emotionally. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. Encourage, support, and comfort each other - inside and outside of the bedroom. Explore emotional / sexual highs and lows together. Go to the edge as a team. Then come back to reality. Hand in hand. We can find your limits and keep them sacred or transcend them over time. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - If you want to get to know me. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day."

I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to meet with on occasion. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past.

I am a 28 year old woman who thrives from a DD/lg relationship. I have a penchant for the mental and emotional side of the dynamic, both weighing in more heavily than the physical/sexual aspects for me. I'd rather put my kinks on display. I have many, they are not static, many are situational. I'm happy to discuss with the right person at the right time. I live in EST and believe that you being in a similar time zone would be beneficial to our relationship, this is negotiable. I am not single and not poly; I'll let you do the math. But for these reasons, our relationship will likely only ever be online. Notwithstanding that limitation, I am seeking something virtually boundless. I crave companionship, romance, control, vulnerability, nurture, and so much more. I am open to all ages and body types. I am a plus size woman myself. What I'm looking for is truly substantial, so please be mature and patient. If you are just looking for pictures or play, move along.

Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in Sunny Florida and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I'm black, curvy, 5'4 I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to occasionally call you Daddy it probably isnt me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl."

I am pansexual. I am open to all genders sexually and romantically. Hearts not parts. If the post makes sense to you - let me know. I want to explore sex with a partner and friends of different genders we will make in the future. Live while we are alive. Politically I lean to the left. Not a pet person. Allergic to smoking. Looking for friends open to the possibility of romance. I tend to get really excited and enthusiastic about things. I want to do really fun things with someone and then talk about how much fun we just had! I love getting to know people. I ask questions because I want to understand. I love long rambling conversations about everything and nothing. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. I want to hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. I want to hold someone in my arms and make them orgasm until they are begging me to stop. Both sides are important to me. I need someone I can let go with. Someone I can hold close when they are having a bad day as I reassure them its going to be ok. Someone I can pin down and fuck. Someone I can dress up like a pretty little princess - do her makeup all nice - so we can see the tears of joy stream down as I fuck her face. As she looks up at me - Ill massage her temples and tell her shes such a good girl. Then, Ill gag her with my cock. I want to dress her like a princess and use her like a whore. Are you that someone? What attracted me to BDSM was finding more people that can respect my unique experience. Someone willing to learn about my life and my body. To emotionally connect inside and outside of the bedroom. Communication is sexy. Understanding each other is sexy. I want to build a safe place to explore each other, make mistakes, fail, recover, change, adapt, succeed, and grow. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That IS what she said. I try to make the world a better place. One conversation at a time. By being kind and compassionate. By encouraging people. By listening and supporting. Believe in yourself. Follow your dreams. Lean towards your passions. I know how hard life can be. No one has to go through it alone. I have really interesting discussions with strangers - in line, in waiting rooms, in elevators, on planes, and online - about our lives. I was waiting for the fireworks at Disneyworld and this guy came up to ask if his wife could sit next to me. I talked to them for 20 minutes. You can learn so much just by listening and paying attention. Communication, intimacy, and vulnerability are important to me. I love teamwork. Honesty. Togetherness. Trust. Boundaries. Respect. I want intimacy, companionship, support, and submission. Acceptance. We do not have to hide how we feel or what we want from each other. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am gentle, supportive, caring, and nurturing. I want cuddling, snuggling, and spooning. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. We can live together, hang out, and enjoy each other sexually and emotionally. I want a lot of intimacy, sex, and kink - with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Sex / kink is very emotional for me. I want to share that with someone after we spend time together in person. I need to talk about things to process them. I need a safe space to decompress after a long day. I need to sit with my feelings, emotions, and pain to understand them. To understand myself better. In any long term relationship, friendly or romantic - arguments happen. Conflict is inevitable. We will hurt each other. I appreciate people that are willing to step back and approach the situation with me - together, as a team, so we can stop hurting each other. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. We can enjoy our desires and fantasies together - we can put everything on the table and work together to bring our fantasies to life. 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I am a homebody. I enjoy spending time with friends. I travel when possible - about once a year. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I love nerding out about BDSM, music, comedy, comics, pro wrestling, and video games. I love spiraling into joking tangents that only make sense to us. Laughing until my stomach hurts and I have trouble catching my breath. There will be inside jokes and bad jokes - as long as one of us laughs. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs mid conversation. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. I love Dr Who. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. The Marvel movies are so much fun. I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. They give me a lot of great ideas... Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are. And try to see where they can go. I am a very positive person. Which has helped me find a path forward. I live with nerve pain in my face and teeth. The best way to describe it is an intense crushing pressure. Sometimes it burns and sometimes it pulses. It never stops. Sometimes it hurts less. Pain is a normal part of my daily life. I can not control my pain. I can mention it and I can manage it. I understand myself and my body very well because of my pain. It also taught me to appreciate the present moments. Dont stop believin I will always be adjusting to life with Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia. I have come a long way in 10 years. Knock me down, I get the fuck back up again. - Hamilton. My disability is invisible. I hide it as well as I can when I am out in the world - but it takes a colossal amount of energy. The pain is draining and hiding it is exhausting. I will not hide my body from a partner. Think of it like - I have the flu. Weakness, fatigue, aches, and pain - without the congestion. Many people have had the flu or helped someone with the flu before - this may help. It can be difficult to focus and think clearly sometimes. I have a professional degree, but may not be able to use it. I will need the help of a nurturing, caring, patient, and supportive partner. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - SUPER bonus points if you already have an outfit). When the pain wears me down - I need someone that can help pull me back up. I can teach you exactly how. Having someone that can help me do more - that I can lean on during hard times - would be a very enjoyable experience. Lets laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. Lets do this - our way. Hold on to that feeling. In BDSM, as in life, it is always ok to say NO. Submission is given and can be taken back anytime. I want to do horrible, degrading, sadistic things to you - and I want to make sure you want and enjoy them. Before. During. And after. Which is a great reason for us to make sure we can communicate clearly. Slow things down and make sure we understand things from each others perspective. I have never dominated you before. I do not know what you want unless you tell me what you want. Streetlight. People. Seeking a person 25+. A best friend to have sexy adventures with. Someone affectionate. Caring. Supportive. Looking for someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone who loves to listen. Someone who likes to talk about their feelings. Someone that wants to be Daddy's little disney princess, French maid, cheerleader. Daddy's little whore. Daddys little sex slave. Daddy's little cumdumpster. I think of domination like making a watch - you set up a system and positively enforce everything - and over time - the system runs by itself. As we work on setting up the background tasks - you can perform tasks as needed. I want to break princess down and raise her back up - training her to meet my needs. Use her for my own sexual gratification as I degrade her. I will use her as my own personal sex toy. I take very good care of my toys. Looking for someone that wants to serve and wear different outfits. I will make sure she has plenty of opportunities to be a good girl. Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill. I love teasing, foreplay, and delaying gratification. I want to torture her with pleasure. I love giving pleasure. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Some of my kinks - dirty talk, oral fixation, deepthroat, degradation, dd/lg, freeuse, cnc (music factory!), dark ageplay, domestic service, outfit control, orgasm control, sensory deprivation, threesomes, worshipping, objectification, collaring, and ageplay. And the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). The movie never ends - it goes on, and on, and on, and on Get out of my sweet dreams. Get into my fast car. Hold my hand. Send me a PM - tell me what resonated with you. Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Dont stop!"
427,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,27 m4f. Online A story I wrote for you,3,bnwizf,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/bnwizf/27_m4f_online_a_story_i_wrote_for_you/,2019-05-13 10:51:42," Youre in the kitchen drinking a glass of water when you get a text from me: Come to the bedroom You wonder what I could want as you walk through the living room and open the door. Your curiosity peaks as you see me standing in the middle of the room. The lights are dim and I have an expression on my face that you cant quite figure out. My eyes rove over your body and a jolt of realization hits you as you see the desire in my eyes. Come here I say and you obey without thinking. Stepping closer to me, you can feel the waves of desire radiating from me. Your breath quickens and you feel your stomach flutter. My lust for you is almost palpable. I reach out and touch your arm. My hand slides up to your shoulder and continues around to hold the back of your neck. My other hand slides around your hip to press into the small of your back and I pull your body tightly to mine. You stare into my eyes for a moment until I lower my mouth to yours. As my soft lips press against yours, your knees weaken and you breath in my scent. You feel my hot mouth open and my tongue grazes your lips. Instinctively, your lips part and our tongues intertwine; dancing around each others mouths. Breathless, you pull back for a moment and take a shaky inhale. My hand tightens around the back of your neck, sliding up to entangle your hair and I pull your mouth back to mine, crushing our lips together in a another passionate kiss. My fingers tighten in your hair and I pull your head back to expose the soft skin of your slender throat. You feel my mouth burning as I begin to kiss your neck, tracing circles with my tongue up from your collar bone to your jaw. Your breathing quickens as the sensation becomes more intense and suddenly I give your neck a slight bite, the pleasure and gentle pain combining in such a sudden, unexpected way that you involuntarily let out a small squeal. Gasping now, you feel my tongue graze your cheek and settle on your ear. I gently bite your earlobe and my hot, wet tongue circles your ear. Suddenly I press it deep and the feeling of my lustful breathing directly on your ear, combined with the warmth and moisture of my tongue is almost overwhelming and you writhe with pleasure and overwhelming desire. Suddenly I withdraw my tongue and tighten my finger in your hair again, pulling your head back a little further. In a low, throaty voice, I speak into your ear. You can feel my beard scratching against your smooth cheek as my jaw moves. Are you a good girl? I ask. You nod your head and the sensation of your hair pulling in my hand surprised you with how good the gentle pain makes you feel. Say it. I command in the same, throaty whisper. Im a good girl. Your voice is low and breathy and with the simple act of following a command, your chest flutters and your breathing picks up. Im sorry, I didnt get that. I say and tighten my fingers again in your hair. Suddenly you understand. Im a good girl... daddy. As the word leaves your lips, the tension in the room builds and you begin to feel your body tingle. Your pussy, already wet from the sensations of my mouth on your throat and ear, grows even wetter and you can begin to feel your panties grow moist. A tingle runs through your entire body as you decide to give yourself over to me completely. Good. I say and release your hair. Youre going to show me how good you can be or there will be consequences. Youre not sure what I mean but, falling deeper into the moment by the second, you look up at me and decide that youre only job is to do what your told. Your mind goes blank and begins to race at the same time and you shiver with excitement. Take off your shirt and bra.  I command. As you follow the command, the cool air hits your skin and your nipples harden. You glance at my face, shyly and are startled to see the amount of lust in my eyes as I stare longingly at your half naked body. Glancing down, your breath catches at the sight of the bulge in my pants. Seeing your glance, I smile and caress your breasts for a moment. On your knees. I say. Yes, daddy. You obey and drop to your knees. Anticipating what I want, you reach out to touch my bulge but, I grab your wrist and you look up. You will do what youre told and I havent told you to do that yet, do you understand? I say. You nod your head but, I dont release your wrist. Say it. Ill do what Im told. You say. I let go and stare down at you for a moment before nodding. Thats my good girl. Take off my pants. You reach back up and unbuckle my belt. You can sense that the sight of you topless and kneeling in from of me is driving me wild and theres a visible throb to the bulge in my pants now. As you unbutton my pants and slide them and my boxers down, my massive cock springs up and almost hits you in the face. The sight of my large organ makes your breathe catch. It stands straight out from my body, pointing right at your face and youre close enough to see it bounce in time with my heart beat. Your heart seems like it will beat out of your chest and you feel moisture dripping from between your legs. Pleasure your daddy. I say in a strained voice and in that moment, your only desire is to fulfill that command. You run your nails up my bare legs and gently cup my balls, feeling their weight and fullness before running your fingers along my shaft. My huge cock throbs as your small, soft hands grip it. You take it in both hands and lower your mouth to the tip. As I feel your breath on the head, I let out a groan and your body tingles with the knowledge that youre giving me incredible pleasure. Your hot tongue flicks out and caresses the tip, swirling and licking. A jolt of desire shoots through your pussy and up your spine as I groan louder and you take the head into your mouth. Your scalp tingles as you begin to suck and you feel my hand on the back of your head. You push deeper and take more in and you can feel my legs begin to shake as the sensation of your hot, wet mouth engulfs my throbbing, sensitive cock. Your hand reaches under the shaft to gently grip and massage my balls while you suck ever more of my thick cock into your salivating mouth. You pull off for a moment and glance up at my face. My eyes stare down at you with glassy wonderment at the sight of my beautiful girl stroking my cock in front of her face. Its the most incredible sight Ive ever seen and your desire to please is overpowering. You lean forward again and take it all the way in. As your nose presses into the soft stubble above my crotch, you feel my massive cock filling your mouth and throat. I throb inside you and let out a long, low groan at the intense sensation. Touch yourself. I suddenly gasp and you gladly comply. Your fingers slip inside your pants and youre amazed at the amount of wetness that pleasing your master has created. You begin to rub your damp pussy in time to the bobbing of your head as you suck my cock quicker now. You let out an involuntary moan as your fingers probe your soaking pussy and you stare up into my eyes. Youve never felt so turned on in your life. Suddenly, I pull your head off my cock and in the dim light, you can see it glistening with your saliva, throbbing quickly in time with my rapid heartbeat directly in front of you. Stand up and strip. I say. And the lust and desire are evident in my voice. As you comply, I step out of my pants and lift the shirt over my head. Standing naked in front of me, your body shivering with desire and excitement, I slowly trace my fingers over your stomach. They trail down to your thighs and trace circles up to your hips. I grip you by the hips and push you backward towards the bed. The backs of your knees hit the edge and you fall onto the mattress, the soft comforter cradling your body as you lay back. I lift you towards the head of the bed and then slide my naked body up yours to kiss you long and deep. My strong hands slide up your body and my nails graze up your arms to pin your wrists to the top of the bed. Touch the wall. I command and you feel my fingers press the palms of your hands against the wall as your arms stretch out above you. You will keep your hands against the wall until I tell you otherwise. I say. Yes daddy. You reply automatically and push you hands harder against the wall. Kneeling between your smooth legs, I smile down at you. Your perfect, silky body is spread out before me. Your breasts heave with each deep, excited breath. I trace my fingers along the insides of your calves, tucking my fingers behind your knees and lifting your legs apart to expose your perfect pink, glistening pussy. You quiver with excitement as I let out a long, slow breath while staring intently between your legs. I smile as I look up and my eyes pierce into yours. The intensity of my gaze holds you rapt as I grin more broadly. Remember, do not take your hands off the wall, I say. And you will be quiet while I work. Youve been a very good, obedient girl so far and for that Im about to reward you. If you start to make too much noise though, there will be consequences. Do you understand? Yes, daddy! I promise to be quiet! You say. Well see about that... I reply and lower my head to kiss the smooth skin of your stomach. As my hot mouth touched the skin just above your navel, an electric shock shoots down your spine and your legs begin to tremble. You feel exposed laying with your arms raised above you, legs spread open. The feeling of extreme vulnerability quickly morphs into state of heightened sensation. You feel every sensation as if it were amplified tenfold. Giving your self over completely allows you to experience the moment in a way youve never felt before. The weight of your body pressing your back into the soft fabric beneath you, the soft air of the fan caressing your nude form, the cooling saliva from my kisses and the hard, smooth wall on your palms combines to give you sensation of grounding. You vow to yourself to feel everything and focus on nothing as you anticipate the pleasure to come. And come it will. Close your eyes. I whisper and you do, trusting that I know what is best for you in that moment. You can feel me over you, the heat from my skin radiates down as I move above you. You gasp slightly as I place another kiss on your stomach, just below the first one. This time I dont lift my head but, instead I trace my tongue down and circle your belly button. Your hips flex upward involuntarily and my firm hand pushes them back down as my tongue slides lower and to the side. As the warmth of my mouth comes to rest on that special spot just inside and below your hip bone, I open wider and suck gently. A stifled moan escapes your lips and you push your hands harder against the wall. I lick down into the crease of your thigh and then place several kisses just above the slit of your pussy. The soft hairs there tickle my nose and I inhale deeply. The musk of your womanhood fills my nostrils and the heady scent strengthens my desire for you. I fight the urge and remind myself that the key to giving you the sensations I want is patience. Ever so slowly I slide my tongue down the outside of your labia. I can taste the juices of your excitement and the sweet and salty flavor causes me to utter my own stifled moan. You feel my beard scratching the insides of your thighs as I bury my head between your legs and begin to flutter my tongue ever so lightly up and down your outer lips."

I work in technology and am very career driven and financially stable. You probably use or are at least familiar with the app/website I work on. I'm a nerdy boi and love me some anime and manga, sci fi, dnd, board and card games, etc. I'm looking for a little I can enjoy spending time with, being playful with, watching TV and movies together, playing games together, and generally just enjoying the ddlg dynamic with each other. Ddlg for me is both sexual and nonsexual. I enjoy the closeness and vulnerability with caring for a little and helping a little feel safe and secure, but most of all adored for who they are. I'm ultimately looking for a partner who I can mutually respect and share myself with. -- As much as I enjoy the ddlg dynamic I also want to share adult conversation and moments as well. Location doesn't necessarily matter but close to Chicago is preferable as I would eventually like to meet you in person. I can share photos of me upon request and would love to see what you all look like too! I'm up to talk to anyone at all even if you're just looking for an ""older friend"", ""uncle"", ""brother"", etc. Don't be shy I am very kind :)"

Please read. I am a relaxed person but needed to be detailed and firm in my post! 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for good girls who show lots of affection and likes to improve and strives to be good. No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult juggling a full, professional life. I am seeking someone that cares and wants to be cared for, laughs, and has good conversation and friendship. I tend to start slow and like to build up I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And Im also not into age regression. Seeking a little girl who is at least 20 years old and the older the better. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads! I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on vanilla topics. Thank you little one I hope to find you."

Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. Just some smol things: \- Please be 27+ \- In the United States \-long distance doesnt bother me There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl."

Bounce you up and down. Hold you close. Read you bedtime stories and take advantage of you. I love teasing and giving pleasure. I want to make you hurt with pleasure. By giving too much or withholding. I love holding you close and forcing orgasms. I can shower you with praise, affection, degradation, and dirty talk. I enjoy mixing everything together. You never know what is going to come out of my mouth. Or when I am going to cum into yours. I think of domination like making a watch - we set up a system and positively enforce everything - and over time - the system runs by itself. As we work on setting up background tasks - you can perform tasks as needed. Aftercare is important. I will need - cuddling and comfort. Reassurance. I would like to explore and build our own dynamic - I am curious about petplay, Cg/l, master / slave. And so much more. We can find things that we like doing and hold on to them. Then continue exploring other dynamics. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can discuss our fantasies. Then, work together to bring them to life. Inside and outside of kink. We can build your wants, needs, kinks, and desires into our dynamic. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay and choking. The movie never ends - it goes on, and on, and on, and on Get outta my sweet dreams. Get into my fast car. Hold my hand. Lets laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What resonated with you? Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Dont stop!"

I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am very good at breaking down complicated concepts and pulling out something simple and clear. I enjoy the search for answers to questions I never knew I had. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. Where things made sense. Domination makes sense to me on a visceral level. I am pansexual. Hearts not parts. I am sapiosexual. I tend to fall for people who can stimulate me intellectually. We can learn from each other. I recently learned about the real pirates of the Caribbean - yo ho! I have a weakness for accents. I hope yall do too ;). I have many stories to share. I overcame many obstacles to become the person I am today. I am happy to share my life experience and knowledge. I love getting to know people through long rambling conversations. I love to dream and improvise. I am interested and curious - I want to know what made you who you are. I want to know about your day and how you feel. Politically I lean to the left. Allergic to smoking. Not a pet person - I associate collars, leashes, training, and conditioning with people. My love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I am a good match for those who are comfortable with communication. I live with chronic pain. For 10 years, I rebuilt my life around my pain. I spent a long time focusing on surviving. Surviving is my job. Life can be difficult. Something as small as holding my hand can make a huge impact. Now - I am putting more energy towards living and enjoying life. I will not let my pain stop me. I can have the life I want. Dont let em hold you down, reach for the stars. - Notorious B.I.G. Knock me down, I get the fuck back up again. - Hamilton. I am incredibly optimistic. I accept things as they are - then find a path to travel. Always look on the bright side of life. I am a very positive person. Which has helped me find a path forward. I am good at reading people and helping them understand themselves. I make the world a better place. By being kind and compassionate. By encouraging people. By listening and supporting. I am empathetic and emotionally intelligent. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being a safe place that my friends can rely on. Huge Disney fan! I am a homebody. I enjoy spending time with friends. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). I am enthusiastic. I want to do really fun things with someone and then talk about how much fun we had! Hold on to that feeling. I love music. I have a thing for rap, progressive metal, 80s pop hits (I CAN go for that), and music with really deep lyrics. I love how my feelings will magically line up with songs I am listening to. I love musicals like Hamilton (Wait for it!). I like watching Netflix. I love playing video games - especially JRPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). I like documentaries. I love mythology. I love superhero movies and tv shows. My favorite tv show is The Wire. I enjoy horror movies. My favorite movies - Avatar and Singin in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love magic and stand up comedy. I love when they defy expectations. They give me great ideas... Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. It keeps me laughing during good and bad times. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. I enjoy going to the movies and the occasional escape room. Seeking - Open to all body types - the more I like you mentally - the more I will like your body. There is a special place in my heart for petite people. That I can curl up with and kind of envelop in my arms. A person 25+. Someone that knows themselves. Knows what they want. Independent. Financially secure. Someone with an open mind. Someone empathetic, intelligent, patient, emotionally intelligent, introspective, affectionate, and nurturing. Someone who gets me and wants to build something special. Someone who wants to be understood. Someone enthusiastic and willing to explore our kinks together - even as we find new ones. Someone who likes to listen. Someone who likes to tease and laugh and play around. Someone to hold me and someone I can hold. Someone to work through problems with. Someone to share my life with. Someone to talk with about everything and nothing. My partner can be my cheerleader - inside and outside the bedroom. My safe place. A best friend to have sexy adventures with. What am I looking for in a relationship? - Companionship. Intimacy, sex, and kink with someone I can trust, rely on, and depend on. Someone I can lean on during hard times - sexually and emotionally. Someone to cum with and someone to talk to. Someone I can let go with - sexually and emotionally. High emotional / sexual intimacy. We can tease each other with inside jokes and bad jokes. Laughing until we hurt and we have to stop to catch our breath. I am a romantic at heart. The destination is not quite as important as the journey. Dont stop believin I will vent my pain to an understanding partner. We can hold hands, stare at the ceiling, and talk about our feelings. Working hard to get my fill, everybody wants a thrill. I can share my pain with my partner through BDSM. I need to make sure my submissive is taken care of so that they can take care of me. Open communication is a must. I am into ageplay and dark ageplay. CNC and freeuse. Incest and molestation roleplay. Curious about bondage and sensory deprivation. Looking for devotion. Someone that loves to please - I will give them so many opportunities. I want to crawl inside your mind. Learn as much as I can. Break you down and build you back up. Teaching and training you to meet my needs. Daddy's little princess, maid, cheerleader, whore, sex slave, and cumdumpster. Because you need it. Because I need it. Because we need it. I like flipping between Daddy and Dom mode. I love the contrast between sweet and sadistic. I am attracted to lips - because of my oral fixation. There are so many ways I want to explore and experiment - with oral and deepthroat. I want to dress you in different outfits and roleplay different scenarios. I want to sit you on my lap. Bounce you up and down. Hold you close. Read you bedtime stories and take advantage of you. I love teasing and giving pleasure. I want to make you hurt with pleasure. By giving too much or withholding. I love holding you close and forcing orgasms. I can shower you with praise, affection, degradation, and dirty talk. I enjoy mixing everything together. You never know what is going to come out of my mouth. Or when I am going to cum into yours. I think of domination like making a watch - we set up a system and positively enforce everything - and over time - the system runs by itself. As we work on setting up background tasks - you can perform tasks as needed. Aftercare is important. I will need - cuddling and comfort. Reassurance. I would like to explore and build our own dynamic - I am curious about petplay, Cg/l, master / slave. And so much more. We can find things that we like doing and hold on to them. Then continue exploring other dynamics. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. We can discuss our fantasies. Then, work together to bring them to life. Inside and outside of kink. We can build your wants, needs, kinks, and desires into our dynamic. Limits are - scat, blood, weapons, needles, heavy impact play, dangerous breathplay and choking. The movie never ends - it goes on, and on, and on, and on Get outta my sweet dreams. Get into my fast car. Hold my hand. Lets laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - What resonated with you? Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day. Dont stop!"

439,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,24 [M4F] US/Online -- Daddy-type Dom looking for someone to nurture.,2,by79js,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/by79js/24_m4f_usonline_daddytype_dom_looking_for_someone/,2019-06-08 21:59:18," Hi! :) Im a nurturing, goofball, Daddy-type Dom looking for someone who craves emotional openness and the rawness of vulnerability with a partner who will respect their needs, push them towards self-improvement, and be an overall pretty awesome friend. Im 24, male, white, 59, average weight, feminist, and on a upwardly winding career path in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, reading history and nonfiction, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, sports, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc). Im always trying to learn something new! Ive tried to live my life so far open minded, focusing on personal happiness and self-improvement. Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners and establish mutual trust to have any sort of kink-based dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I am one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand questions to satiate my desire to learn about you and how to make you laugh.  Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have experience with many different kinks and types of play, and love them all in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM and sexuality, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side, such as liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, verbal responses and protocol, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure over using pain. However, there are definitely times and places for pain and punishment, and I don't shy away from them. I crave getting into a partners mind completely, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing, dirty talk and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more. As it pertains to DDLG specifically, an ideal partner for me would be a middle or older little. ABDL doesnt interest me, but I really like the fun, supportive DDLG dynamic. Im primarily looking for online female partners for now with the potential to eventually meet in person. I'm in Western NY so someone in the NE US or great lakes region is preferred! Intelligence, drive and emotional maturity are extremely attractive to me. Im also potentially interested in talking with switch couples, looking to share dominance or explore subbing for me together. I am open to either polyamory or monogamy, and will fully respect the boundaries of any kind of relationship I am in. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, let me know! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :) (A sampling of conversation topics to get me talking: What would your dream life look like? What do you fear? Do you like thunderstorms? What 3 things do you care about most? What food could you absolutely not give up? Justin, Travis or Griffin? What is your Myers Briggs personality type? Hot take: Are Myers Briggs personality types bullshit? Weirdest music you listen to? Do you like documentaries about cults and little lost corners of history? Know a DM I can play with and learn from? Did I mean that in a BDSM or DnD context? Want to start a back porch garden?)"

That may not have worked - but - I can not snap my fingers. Let me try - This IS the post you are looking for - waves hands.. No? We may have to imprint the ""mind control magical spells"" - as we go. First - I want to thank everyone for reading this piece of my soul. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am charming and funny. I live with chronic pain - I can explain it all in detail as we get to know each other. It has taken a long time to get comfortable sharing this part of my life with someone - and here I am. For that AND kink. I am a homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I travel when possible. I love learning about different thought systems and pulling out nuggets of wisdom and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That is what she said. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - super bonus points if you already have an outfit). A best friend to enjoy my life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. I am silly and love making people laugh - even if it is just myself. Looking for friends and the possibility of something more. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. Life likes to throw things at us when we least expect them. There are times we need to step back and pause - everything. Which is why we need a foundation to fall back on - no matter what is happening. A vanilla foundation we can add bdsm sprinkles to over time. If we are close, we can see each other often. If we are far away, we can get together later. I work well with people who are - assertive, confident, genuine, direct, specific, emotional, inquisitive, and vulnerable. Seeking someone 25-45. A submissive or a switch. Someone to slowly and carefully explore all of my kinks and fantasies with. In conversation and BDSM. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone I can connect and grow with - emotionally and sexually. We can see and accept all of each other. I love learning about people and their passions. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Me too! I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We can explore our minds together. Go spelunking and enjoy discovering whatever we come across. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out! I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, emotions and physical / emotional pain with each other. Everything is valid. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics (Communism - great in theory, horrible in execution), sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I listen to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs when talking to people. I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorite RPGs. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am very good at it. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Let's explore each other and build something meaningful. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Now for the sexy part because people need to get to sleep / back to work - yes, that means you. I am pansexual. I love people. I am interested in exploring with others alongside my partner - eventually. I lean towards the dominant end of the spectrum. I love the mental and emotional part of BDSM. Kinks / Sprinkles - dirty talk, oral, deepthroat, ageplay, dark ageplay, petplay, degradation, trap / femboy / sissy, threesomes, begging, orgasm control, outfit control, incest, breeding, dd/lg, md/lb, nursing, ownership, collaring, freeuse, objectification, 1950s housewife, domestic service, raceplay, misogyny, and the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). Limits - weapons, needles!!!, blood, scat, choking and breathplay Softer limit - heavy impact play I want to mix nurturing, gentle, and sweet with sadistic - I want to do horrible / beautiful things to you after I / we dress you in beautiful outfits. I want to wrap my arms around you - and whisper all your deepest fantasies in your ear as I hold you close to me. I want to dive deep into everything that brings us pleasure, to understand how and why. Then, we can use this knowledge to please each other - like we have all the answers to a test. I want you to turn me on by leaning over during dinner and teasing me - torturing me with words - because you know me so well. I enjoy time as a daddy and a little - nurturing and being nurtured. My little side is dominant sometimes - I want mommy to hold me close, massage me, nurse me, and rock me - but I also want to make her my sex toy. My dominant fantasies include - A harem, CNC (music factory!), training someone to love the things I love over time - with orgasms, conditioning, and more! I am not locked into any specific dynamic. I want to try to find what we like as we go - I have never dominated you before. And I will not - until we have built something in person. I'd do anything for love (but I won't do that). We can not jump right to a 24/7 collared TPE before I meet your parents. I may not work well with brats - the resistance confuses me. I want to explore so much in person with the right person. Discover our favorite things together over time. The more we explore - the more we will find. Make mistakes and turn them into inside jokes. Have a lot of awkward fun together. The destination is an illusion. Getting there and staying there is the fun part. Lets focus on the present. Together. Do not hesitate to send me a PM if you want to get to know me better. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for reading. Have a wonderful day!"

Looking for someone with decades of experience? Not me. I discovered BDSM two years ago. This is in my bones. My DNA. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? - keep reading. Do you want to be used and degraded? Be a pretty little princess and a fucking whore at the same time? - keep reading. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. I found a place to belong. In BDSM, as in life, it is always ok to say No. Submission is earned and can be taken back anytime. I dream of finding another pansexual switch. We will explore and dominate / submit each other - and others. I understand this may be difficult to find - I can find a submissive partner - who will let me explore my submissive side - with them or with others. As long as everyone gets their needs met - I am ok with any arrangement. Sex matters. Kink matters. I want to do this in a committed and exclusive relationship. Before branching out. I want to go slowly. Lets laugh, fuck, talk about our feelings, and have a great time. I want to learn and grow with someone I trust. I want a human connection before I want a kink connection. I am passionate about oral, degradation, dd/lg, md/lb, freeuse, domestic service, outfit control, orgasm control, sensory deprivation, and dark ageplay. And the rest (Here on Gilligan's Island!). I am comfortable with myself and my sexual and emotional wants / needs. If you enjoy service and submission - I can tell you what my needs are - you can meet them - which will make you happy, which will make me happy - through empathy. We can build a feedback loop together. I love teamwork. Honesty. Togetherness. The thought of knowing that we will work hard and build something amazing together. That we can both enjoy for a long time. Reading and researching and studying and comparing likes and notes and desires. So we can discover and enjoy emotional and sexual highs together. I am well educated, intelligent, and understanding. I am a homebody. I go out with friends every now and then. I travel when possible. I love learning about different thought systems and pulling out nuggets of wisdom and absorbing that into my own personal belief system. If it makes sense to you and you can support it - it is a validly held belief. I am growing and changing. I want to do it with someone. That IS what she said. I want someone here beside me - to be my cheerleader (inside and outside of the bedroom - super bonus points if you already have an outfit). A best friend to enjoy life with. Someone to have sexy adventures with. Someone to feel safe with in every way. Looking for friends and the possibility of something more. Looking for the right connection that can build into a romantic partner. Someone to trust, rely on, and depend on. If we are close, we can see each other often. If we are far away, we can get together later. I work well with people who want to explore sexually and emotionally and are - assertive, genuine, direct, specific, emotional, inquisitive. Someone kind, funny, and a good listener. Seeking someone 25+. A switch or submissive. Someone to explore all of our kinks and fantasies with. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone I can connect and grow with. We can see and accept all of each other. I love learning about people and their passions. I live with chronic pain. I understand myself and my body very well because of it. It taught me to appreciate what I have. I can explain it all in detail as we get to know each other. I hope to find more people that can understand my needs - who can give my feelings and pain a space to exist. There is no cure. What helps the most is encouragement, support, listening, and acceptance. I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand thoughts, feelings, and emotions. We can explore our minds together. Go spelunking and enjoy discovering whatever we come across. I love probing the dark corners of the mind - bring flashlights. I want to dive deep into everything that brings us pleasure, to understand how and why. We can use this knowledge to please each other - like we have all the answers to a test. We can torture and tease each other with our words because we know and understand each other so well. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I love breaking things down and really understanding them. Lets talk it out! I am interested and curious - I want to know every story and really understand what made you who you are. I want to know what you think and I want you to know what I think. The deeper this goes - the more openly and transparently we can discuss our feelings, perspectives, thoughts, and emotions with each other. I have a darker sense of humor (think - Cards Against Humanity). 6 foot. Big Handsome Man. Beard. Glasses. Huge Disney fan! I love nerding out about politics (Communism - great in theory, horrible in execution), sex, philosophy, and video games. I have a deep love of music. I love how my feelings will magically line up with the songs I am listening to. I love quoting song lyrics and singing songs while talking to people.

Please read 38 male here in NYC. I'm 5'11, 160, fairly good shape, single (divorced) great career, balanced, clean, and enjoy being a Daddy Dom for a good girls who show lots of affection and like to improve, please, and strives to be good and obedient . No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. I have a primary part time little so you would be allowed one additional but safe play partner as well. The focus is on pleasure and exploration and escape based on our secret desires its not easy to discuss with others. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost and excessively clingy. And be ok and available on a part time basis. Seeking a little girl who is at least 20 years old and the older the better I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I also like some bdsm, in particular Im skilled with rope play, and love exploring boundaries and get a special thrill from orgasm control and teasing. I also enjoy bringing someone deep into their body and pleasure zones into previously uncharted waters. Cyber play is fun but I am looking for someone **local** to NY to meet with on occasion probably once or twice a month. On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and has not been in a psych ward in the past. Im only interested in those that have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, ethnicity, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on kik or texting on google voice on vanilla topics. Thank you little one I hope to find you"

444,vulnerability,DDLGPersonals,24 [M4F/FM] US/Online -- Daddy-type Dom looking for someone to grow with.,10,b16m51,https://www.reddit.com/r/DDLGPersonals/comments/b16m51/24_m4ffm_usonline_daddytype_dom_looking_for/,2019-03-15 09:13:26,"Hi! Im a nurturing, goofball, Daddy-type Dom looking for someone who craves emotional openness and the rawness of vulnerability with a partner who will respect their needs, push them towards self-improvement, and be an overall pretty awesome friend. Im 24, male, white, 59, normal/average weight, feminist, and on a winding upward career path in environmental tech. I lean to the homebody side of the social spectrum and have lots of varied hobbies (video games, history books, hiking/kayaking/adventuring, foodie activities, podcasts, digital art etc!). Im always trying to learn something new! Ive tried to live my life so far open minded, focusing on personal happiness and self-improvement. Ive learned from my past partners and dynamics that I really need to get to know my partners to fully establish mutual trust to have any kind of dynamic. Im not one to send one-word texts, dick pics or passive-aggressive responses. I am one to need to restrain myself from sending a thousand personal questions to satiate my appetite to learn about you and how to make you laugh. Open communication is absolutely critical for my relationships- this means talking about desires, limits, interests, relationship boundaries, etc. Similarly, consent and respect are concepts I take very seriously in all facets of my life. From my experience this communication is particularly necessary to make relationships like this work, even if it means taking more time and moving slowly. I have experience with many different kinks; I am knowledgeable of and love them in their own ways. I love actively learning more about BDSM, as well as talking about it. As previously mentioned, I am a nurturing, guiding Dom, but I have a sweet sadistic side involving liking to overwhelm and overstimulate my sub with intense sensation. I really like rules and training, such as positions, responses, etc. I prefer to reward and praise than punish, and similarly love to give and deny pleasure more than pain. I crave getting into a partners mind completely, learning every nook and cranny of their sexuality to use against them in the best way possible. I find it much more empowering to make someone want to submit to me, and prove it, than to take power from them. Orgasm control, sensation play, relentless teasing and humiliation are my top kinks, but Im very open minded and love helping partners explore their interests. I can give more details about my kinks, limits etc if we talk more. As it pertains to DDLG specifically, an ideal partner for me would be a middle or older little. ABDL doesnt interest me, but I generally really like the fun, gentle, supportive DDLG/CGL dynamic. Im primarily looking for online female partners (18-28ish) right now with the potential to eventually become in-person. While Im in the US Northeast, Im not exactly sure where I will be within the next year or two. Im not tied down to any particular location yet, so hit me up, I might be coming to a town near you! Im also interested in couples who are switchy, looking to share dominance or explore subbing together. I am open to either polyamory or monogamy, and will fully respect the boundaries of any kind of relationship I am in. If this sounds like anything youre interested in, hit me up! If not and you read this far anyway, I wish you the best on your kinky journey and hope you find what youre looking for. :) (A sampling of conversation topics that would get me talking for ages: What would your dream life look like? What do you fear? Do you like thunderstorms? What 3 things do you care about most? What food could you absolutely not give up? Justin, Travis or Griffin? What is your Myers Briggs personality type? Hot take: Are Myers Briggs personality types bullshit? Weirdest music you listen to? Do you like documentaries about cults and little lost corners of history? Know a DM I can play with and learn from? Want to start a back porch garden?) :D"

I've been aware of Ddlg for a year or two now but I've recently become more interested in the dynamic and really desire to find the perfect Daddy, and by perfect I mean a daddy that will really get to know me and in turn allow me to get to know him in his truest form. Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in Sunny Florida and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffies and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of my time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I am black with big brown eyes and black hair past my shoulders; I'm 5'4. I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl.

He knows how to put on a show! I had to mention one of his songs. Do you love, respect, and treasure vulnerability? Me too! Lets be friends! I love sitting in, talking about, processing, and working to understand feelings. Looking for friends to talk to and spend time with. I do not want to rush into anything serious right away - we can really get to know each other and see how it goes. I am pansexual. I am open to everyone. I want feminine / nurturing energy for my next romantic relationship. I love having friends of all shapes, sizes, genders, etc. What box? I live with 24/7 chronic nerve pain in my face and teeth. My pain is very draining, exhausting, and overwhelming. Some days are harder than other days. My disability taught me that many things in life are outside of my control. I see my pain as an avenue for growth, learning, and change. It taught me to live life and appreciate what I have. To focus on the positive. To not hide from the pain life throws at me - and to embrace it. This is a part of my life and who I am. I can not control my pain. I can mention it and I can manage it. Talking openly about my pain helps me manage it. Talking about my pain helps me feel understood. In my relationships I need a comforting space to express and explore my pain. My pain has been my constant companion for 10 years - and will likely be there for the rest of my life. I embrace and accept it. I have been kinky for a very long time - but had difficulty finding people who understood. Until now. It is such a wonderful feeling - being accepted and understood. When I discovered bdsm - I knew I found a place where I belonged. I connect with people on a deep and emotional level. I am very introspective. I enjoy stepping back to explore feelings and tangents.

I have a passion for blowjobs, nursing, and ageplay - I hope you do too. I am a dominant leaning switch. I wear many hats - Daddy, Dom, little. A friend / partner / submissive can learn all about my chronic pain and how they can be there for me over time. Seeking - Someone 25-45. A friend. Eventually, I hope to build a romantic relationship. Someone comfortable with vulnerability. Someone that enjoys service. I want to find a safe place I can reach out to - when Im excited. When I want to share it with someone. When Im overwhelmed and exhausted. When I need a shoulder to cry on. The right person can really help - by empowering me - no matter how powerless I feel. Affection, comfort, empathy, and support. Just by being there. Let's help each other become the best version of ourselves as we explore each other. Someone I can connect and grow with. Someone who wants to understand and be understood. Someone that loves to talk dirty! Someone I can cry with and someone I can cum with. I am into very many things kink wise and I want to explore as many things as we possibly can. Send me a PM - Tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for checking me out. Have a wonderful day!"

I love playing JRPGs - currently working my way through Yo-kai Watch 3. The Witcher 3 is one of my all time favorites. Wrestling nerd - I love John Cena (Never Give Up!). My favorite tv show is The Wire. My favorite movies are Avatar and Singin' in the Rain. I love falling into any storytelling experience - comic books, anime, and books. I love connecting with the characters and learning new things about myself from the struggles they overcome. I love mythology, magic, and stand up comedy. I love being surprised by punchlines and the way they use words to entertain. Never Not Funny is my favorite podcast. I enjoy watching the Marvel movies. I occasionally host board game nights with my friends. My top 3 love languages are words of affirmation, physical touch, and quality time. I love to cuddle, snuggle, and spoon - be close together. I am gentle, caring, and nurturing. I love being there for people. I am very good at it. I love being taken care of and nurtured. I am very accepting of others and their kinks. Let's help each other become the best version of ourselves as we explore each other. Let's build a safe place together. We can build a relationship with trust, respect, vulnerability, and honesty. Together. I can be your bright, shining light in the darkness. You can be mine. Send me a PM - If you want to get to know me. Tell me what resonated with you and tell me your favorite song(s). Good Luck everyone! Thank you for checking me out. Have a wonderful day!"

Authenticity is the goal here. Big me: I live in Sunny Florida and I'm a student as well (Working on my Masters). In my down time I enjoy reading and writing. I play piano and love to be by the water. Memes are my second language, so if you don't like them this may not work out lol. Little me: I don't really have an age I gravitate towards but my little space is spent cuddling my stuffs and coloring (trying to stay in the lines, bu always failing D: ) When I get angry or frustrated I scrunch up my face and when I'm sad or scared I retreat to hide. I can be a brat, but I will always strive to be called your good girl. I spend so much of m time being big me and having to ""adult"" that I want to just have moments where I don't have to do anything and just be little and carefree. What I want: I want to be your ""sweet baby angle"" lol your ""cute dumb baby faced girl"" I want to take this slow and REALLY get to know you. I want you to love my little space and crave for me to be in it more. I don't think I should be calling you Daddy after a week of talking and you shouldn't expect me to. ""Daddy"" means so much and I only want to bestow that on someone who deserves it and wants to be that for me. What you can expect from me: Loyalty, honesty, vulnerability, cuteness, brattiness. This is serious for me and I will pretty much do what it takes to find my Daddy and keep him in my life. I'm black, curvy, 5'4 I'm looking for long-term so if you want FwB or just someone to call you Daddy in bed, it's not me. Also please be older than me (Doesn't matter how much older) and in the United States. There is sooooo much more I could say (and I feel like I've said so much already), but I suppose I should keep the rest for PMs. So please, message me and let's see if perhaps you're my Daddy and I'm your little girl.

I'm a Dominant man who is looking for a submissive woman to invest my time and my effort into. Ideally I am looking for something that will be a very long-term relationship, since I want to choose you to be one of the priorities in my life. I have been a Dom for many years now and I'm open to either an online (long distance) or a local in person relationship. I invite you to take a few moments and read through this synopsis so you can know more about me and what I have to offer. **As a person, I am** - Thoughtful, verbose, silly, romantic, nurturing, sarcastic, and often immature. I take good care of the ones who are special to me and very often I place their needs above my own. - Primarily sapiosexual, reasonably intelligent, a lover of the Oxford comma, as well as a fan of science fiction and fantasy novels. - A blatant subscriber to Hulu, Netflix and Amazon Prime. I'm a cord cutter and an avid technology enthusiast. - Torn between being a career man, the best dad I can be and a youth wanting to play PC video games until all hours. (For the Horde!) - Much more available during the weekday in the EST timezone than other times. - Married to a vanilla partner who is aware of my involvement in the lifestyle but certainly does not want to see it nor see the details. So not an open relationship. - Irreparably devoted, committed, loving, and faithful once engaged in a relationship. **As a Dominant, I am** - Energetic, engaging, creative, very good at specific instructions, and...sometimes challenging. - Leaning much more towards the Daddy side than the Dominant side, I tend to be much more easy going rather than strict. Thats not at all to say Im one to let something go by of course, I just tend to identify more on the stern Daddy Dom side of things. - While I believe that this takes time to develop and trust to build, Im very much a visually motivated dominant. Pictures and even video are very much something I enjoy from my submissive. - Possessing a high degree of experience (of over a decade), mostly in long term online relationships with some in-person scenes or partial power exchange. Im not looking to tell you how to run your business, but Im open to most anything else in your life. **Physically, I am** - According to recent polls, a HWP white man with expressive hazel/green eyes, brown hair (with a fair amount of salt and pepper to it) and hands that'd look great around your neck. - Certainly enjoying the dad bod concept that is all the rage. **A Note on Kinks:** Listing kinks is like listing everything you enjoy at a Chinese buffet. I really want everything, but you're making me give you a list that just doesn't do justice to what actually ends up my plate. I'm rather happy to dive into specifics down the road. Rather than pigeonhole myself, here's a categorical list. Use your imagination. *The Highlight Reel:* - Stern Daddy Dom style but without the regression or age play. - Power exchange is a favorite of course. While I fully realize the intricacies involved with some degree of TPE, ideally a large degree of power exchange is a must. - Physical vulnerability (yes, I know this is basically submission defined but bear with me) such as forced orgasm, con non con, predicaments, ropes and restraints -- all that. As challenging as that is sometimes in an online relationship. - Sensory play, including pleasure, pain, and sensory deprivation -- nothing that scars or carries a high death risk. - Lifestyle and image control that falls just short of dollification. Outfit selection, food monitoring, workout monitoring, etc. - Exhibitionism that doesn't expose you to others not consenting. - Obedience and compliance, as well as meticulous control and attention is what gets me going. - *Extras:* Slut shaming, behavior modification focused degradation/humiliation, body marking, ownership enforcement, etc. **In my perfect world, my submissive partner would be:** - Based here in the US, preferably in the east coast for timezone purposes. - Between 25-50 years old. - Available *sometime* within my available weekday hours (7a-7p EST) - Highly attentive and communicative. - Looking to live our long distance/separate lives together as much as we possibly can. Not confining ourselves to specific areas of sharing our lives together but opening up every facet of our lives to one another over time and trust. - Excited by the idea of mutual obsession, infatuation, and utter devotion. - Experienced OR actively learning and reading to gain more experience. - A strong speaker with high expectations for command of the English language . - Witty, dry sarcasm, dark humor are all a plus (please don't drown me in your lol's. I'll admit I am a sucker for a good placed GIF though). - Emotionally available. - Married or unmarried, tethered or untethered is irrelevant. Must be transparent with me and my expectation is some degree of monogamy even if you are in a LTR or married at some point. I'm not looking to be #3 in your rotation. To clarify further, in a long term concept with someone who is also married/in a LTR, I'm not looking for either of us to be in a relationship (physical or emotional) with anyone outside of each other and our respective partners. **Communication:** - Hangouts (text, voice/video calls), emails, Kik, snail mail (PO box -- I'm not that insane), or in person. I've posted here before and met some amazing people, but ultimately long term wise, it hasn't lasted to what I've wanted.

In the best interest of both of us, this is going to be meticulously written, and long. Keep in mind, this is big-girl me talking. **Getting physical characteristics out of the way:** I am in my early 20s. I am a small girl with an hourglass figure. Big, bright eyes. Dark, wavy hair that falls past my shoulders. I look *rather young*, so if you are into that (and I hope you are), Id imagine wed have considerable physical chemistry. I prefer reasonably fit, classy men, white, hispanic or asian, no older than 35. **About you:** You are ambitious and a hard-worker. You have a zeal for living life to its fullest, and this reveals itself in the choices and decisions you make. You have an appetite for learning about the world, reveling in the elation of travel and exploration. You do not have any addictive behaviors or tendencies towards drugs, alcohol, casual sex, or video games. You are, of course, a knowledge-seeker. We can keep each other engaged for hours in thoughtful conversation. Your intelligence impresses me. But you are also *emotionally intelligent*, and highly empathetic. This is what draws me to you. This is what captivates me, mind and body, and allows me to entrust you with my vulnerability. You understand your role as a caregiver to someone with the capacity to make sense of her world, but is nevertheless fearful of it, and who needs her Daddy.

I understand I have not provided much about my interests, hobbies, kinks or little space activities. We can get into those one-on-one. Everything I have laid out, I feel, is a foundation for getting to know each other further. I know you are out there somewhere, Daddy, waiting to scoop me up into your arms. "

In the best interest of both of us, this is going to be meticulously written, and long. Keep in mind, this is big-girl me talking. **Getting physical characteristics out of the way:** I am in my early 20s. I am a small girl with an hourglass figure. Big, bright eyes. Dark, wavy hair that falls past my shoulders. I look *rather young*, so if you are into that (and I hope you are), Id imagine wed have considerable physical chemistry. I prefer reasonably fit, classy men, white, hispanic or asian, no older than 35. **About you:** You are ambitious and a hard-worker. You have a zeal for living life to its fullest, and this reveals itself in the choices and decisions you make. You have an appetite for learning about the world, reveling in the elation of travel and exploration. You do not have any addictive behaviors or tendencies towards drugs, alcohol, casual sex, or video games. You are, of course, a knowledge-seeker. We can keep each other engaged for hours in thoughtful conversation. Your intelligence impresses me. But you are also *emotionally intelligent*, and highly empathetic. This is what draws me to you. This is what captivates me, mind and body, and allows me to entrust you with my vulnerability. You understand your role as a caregiver to someone with the capacity to make sense of her world, but is nevertheless fearful of it, and who needs her Daddy. You are patient, and you are honest in the words you speak. You desire to be the center of my world and little space, and to indulge in ageplay with me. **About me:** I am in school, getting a four-year degree.

I realize my post is quite different and may put some off, but maybe a few will be open. I am looking for the most part for something that's mostly sexual, all online, mostly through chat. I am in a relationship that is otherwise happy and fulfilling, but sexually unsatisfying. That's no reason to throw an entire life and relationship away, but these aren't desires I can just ignore. What I'm hoping for: a sexual little, one who enjoys that with the dynamic. I suppose I consider myself more of a soft Dom. I love rough sex, primal and lustful and animalistic, but I'm not much for bondage or pain or anything. I've always been very curious but it's another thing I'm not able to explore irl. My hope is for a fun, silly, giggly little who very much enjoys teasing and all the visual aspects of ddlg. Outfits, stuffies, bows, etc. I'm in my late 20s, currently floating around 275lbs, but down from 350 since summer and my goal is another 50-75 down by next summer. Beard, 6' (okay technically 11 &amp; 3/4 but it's a quarter inch dammit!). I like to think I'm pretty good at self discipline. I work and go to school, have my life and schedule laid out and routined, and generally like to think I've got myself pretty put together. My hobbies and school revolve a lot around computer-related stuff, specifically networking and Cybersecurity, and I spend a lot of my limited free time desiring to expand my knowledge and just mess around with gadgets and toys."

Currently residing in Kentucky I'm looking for a local forever little, so starting out as friends and getting to know each other is fine by me, after all I'm not looking for something short lived, and I want us to be able to trust each other. A little about me: I'm currently going to college online for a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity as well as working full time in construction; I'm generally busy thanks to that, but I'm able to text for a majority of the day regardless so keeping in touch won't be a problem. I'm a big clingy towards my little, I always like to know what they're up to and how they're doing, or to just talk to them throughout the day as much as I can. I'm a mix between a soft and a hard Dom so you'll get the best of both with me. I'm 5'06"" and currently on the chubby side (I'm working hard at slimming down and gaining muscle though). For hobbies I highly enjoy bowling, video games, watching anime, swimming, skate/longboarding, and sleeping. I have Discord so if you wanna talk there just ask for it! Here's a list of my kinks: DDLG, BDSM, Rigging, Degrading, Cock Worship (receiving), Spanking (giving), Biting (giving for sure, on the fence with being bit), Hair Pulling (giving), 24/7 Total Power Transfer, CNC, Public Teasing/Sex, Anal (giving), Rough Play/Sex, Brats My limits: Scat, vore, feet, vomit, diapers Things I'd be willing to try at least once: Water Sports (definitely not the receiving end though).. that's kinda it, I'm sure there's more that I don't know of yet though. If you'd like to chat or ask me any questions then just send me a message here on Reddit :)"

My name is Nick. I'm 29, I live in South Austin TX, and I work in audio/video for a living. I'm really into Sci-fi, music, true crime, cybersecurity, and podcasts. I also enjoy gaming, reading, and I write and record music and perform in a band. I really enjoy digital privacy as a hobby - I like to see how much I can avoid being tracked by Google and Facebook and stuff like that, but I'm not so hardcore about it that I'm willing to go live in a cabin in the woods. Also dad to two cats and a ball python. [Here's some pics of me.](URL As the title says, I am polyamorous. I understand not everyone is, so I just wanted to be upfront about that. My views on poly are that if I'm doing things right, no partner should feel like a secondary. I currently live with my girlfriend, we've been together for a year and we're quite happy. I'm not looking to leave her, just expand my current circle, and she knows I'm looking. She would want to meet any potential partners but she's not really looking to join any new relationships right now. She's not against it, but she's pretty busy so she's not actively looking. This is really just for me. But she is hugely nerdy, huge into anime and video games, so if that's you you'll probably get along with her pretty well. I consider myself heteroflexible, which is why I marked ""M4R,"" but I'm mainly attracted to femme and androgynous looking people. You're welcome to try your luck even if you're clearly male-presenting but I'm just letting you know I'm not likely to be interested. Sorry, nothing person, but we like what we like and again I wanted to be upfront. Having said that, gender doesn't really matter to me so feel free to contact me if you're trans, NB, male, female, whatever if I pique your interested and you think we might be a good fit. I would prefer someone local to central Texas but I might be willing to do long distance if we have good chemistry. If there's anything I missed, let me know. Hope to hear from someone cool!"
