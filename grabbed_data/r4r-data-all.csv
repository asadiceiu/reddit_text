0,vulnerability,r4r,29 [M4F] Anywhere - are you left wanting more?,1,i2f2ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/i2f2ru/29_m4f_anywhere_are_you_left_wanting_more/,2020-08-03 02:40:32,"**Preface:** I am an established small business owner in a small and remote Caribbean island. Due to how things work down here everyone I meet is either a current client, a prospective client, another business owner or a close friend. This makes dating a challenge and with covid-19 traveling to meet others is very difficult when you are trying to run a business. **Who I am:** I am 6 foot two, have golden blonde hair, green eyes and a thin athletic build. I have an undergraduate degree in economics, ten years of work experience in component level IT, am well traveled, socially adept, a man of family, a practicing casual musician and life long martial artist. When I am not drowning myself in work I enjoy sitting in the sun, reading, watching the usual tv shows/movies as well as cooking, hiking and being outdoors. On a deeper level I am emotionally aware; I know what it feels like to be in pain and I also know what it means to be happy and fulfilled. I have had experiences that would have broken the average person and have used them to become a better man. These experiences are not always to my benefit as they keep me from loving the stereotypical person. For me to have a real connection a significant other must know and understand what life really means. **What I am looking for:** I am seeking a long term relationship with a woman that values trust, emotional vulnerability, financial stability and who wants to build a future cemented in a foundation of success. If we are able to connect online and things seem like they could work in person this is an opportunity for you to start over in a new country devoid of your past experiences - a fresh start. I am an extremely serious person and I am looking for the same thing in return. If you have never been in a long term relationship, have never felt pain or are otherwise inexperienced this is not for you; what I have to offer isn't a fairy tale but a real, uncompromising connection with someone who has lived life at its best and its worst. Think you are a fit? Let's hear from you!"
1,vulnerability,r4r,"34 [R4F/TF] Online/Everywhere - Maximum Vulnerability, Go!",1,i2k97y,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/i2k97y/34_r4ftf_onlineeverywhere_maximum_vulnerability_go/,2020-08-03 07:35:27,"This is a re-edit of an older post. A lot is going on with me. I'm posting as ""R"" because honestly...I feel like I could be either at this point. Maybe you're interested in meeting one or the other? Maybe both. This is going to seem ranty...and it is. Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. This has only gotten more complicated in the last few months as I struggle to figure out my own gender, sexuality, and identity in general. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer [person]"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. As I embrace the possibility of not being the gender I was biologically born as I feel less shame and guilt about it and more empowered to explore it. Go figure. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. Let me be clear. I'm not looking for your help. I'm not looking for a therapist. I know this all seems heavy but I'd really rather prefer mostly light hearted conversation. I just want you to know I'm a real person, with real problems, and it's okay if you are too. I'm not looking for someone to complain to all day. Just some good company and conversation. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

Let's discuss real stuff and be uncomfortable with the level of vulnerability we attain. Maybe we can write stories together or break down the meaning behind a song that has resonated with both of us for some reason. Let's debate about the best 80s fantasy movie and worst horror movie that is still kind of the best anyway. Tell me about a time you made your parents cringe with your behavior. Please just be REAL.

I'm 27, English isn't my native language, so I am sorry for the awful grammar. I love movies, everything geek, from Harry Potter to Star Wars to Pokemon I'm about 1.75 m, dark brown eyes, beard and short black hair. I work 5 to 6 days a week as a restaurant manager. Cooking is something I adore to do, as is gaming, pets, science, architecture, space, learning... But probably my biggest passion is music! I am from a small country in Europe but I am planing to move somewhere by 2021/2. Which means I am willing to move closer to you in a couple of years. I do love it here but I know I won't find my soulmate here. I am open minded about pretty much everything, I love talking about politics and religion. I am strong believer of equality for everyone and a supporter of LGBTQ. About my kinky side,I like to take control, I love to set up as many rules as possible and to give guidance. I've my limits as you have yours and they are to be respected, but that's something to be discussed later on. I am also sapiosexual mixed with demi-romantic dom Daddy, which mean I am more about personality and intelligence and only attracted to sexual aspects after a good mental connection. I have experience in ddlg but everyone is different and every relationship is different. Sex is important but isn't not the most important thing in a relationship. I don't want to base the relationship on sexual aspects, I want a perfect balance between mental connection, love, respect and sex! I am waiting for someone to help guide and a possible relationship if we work out well. I am patient and passionate but I can be pushy and direct when the occasion dictates. I like being transparent with people and I expect the same in return. I am here for the vulnerability and connection I suspect you are not from my little town, so please be open to pics / voice recordings / videos. Friends are welcomed too! Just please be +18, single and able to verify your age!"

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"
6,vulnerability,r4r,27 [M4F] Toronto - Dating is great because there are plenty of fish in the sea. Except all the fish are in the same boat.

7,vulnerability,r4r,29 [F4R] US- I don't expect anything from this but a few conversations and that's okay!,1,i66uu3,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/i66uu3/29_f4r_us_i_dont_expect_anything_from_this_but_a/,2020-08-09 07:08:09," The first thing you need to know about me is that I love words. I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."

I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

Im searching for a playmate that, provided there is some chemistry, would be open to a committed relationship. &amp;nbsp; ##### A little bit about myself I am a 24 year old sub with strong masochistic tendencies paired with light brattiness. Id describe my build as petite (68kg), with long ashen brown hair, a fair complexion and a height of 185cm. Currently residing in the north-western part of the country, however I am planning to move inland. Emotionally Im very sensitive and because of that I look for high emotional literacy in my partners. I consider myself nerdy, ranging from anime and gaming, all the way up to a good book and a solid discussion. I can be just as content going out for a date, as I am spending a day cuddling on the couch. Other than that curiosity is a big motivation in my life, I have a lot of interests and I like exploring those to their fullest extent. This has resulted in a very experimentalist mindset, one that loves to explore and soak up information. &amp;nbsp; The biggest pull in BDSM for me is the expectation, rather than the exception, of clear, thorough and honest communication. I consider these essential for any healthy bonding, but especially so for a relationship, not to mention one where kink plays an important role. &amp;nbsp; ##### What Im looking for in a partner A man that is both honest and dominant enough to allow himself to be emotionally vulnerable. Someone to cuddle with on the couch, maybe even including some rope, while a series is playing in the background. A Dom that is more on the sensitive and caring side, but also holds a sadistic edge with the ability to enjoy things like degradation and edgeplay. Though not required, ideally someone with a love for rope, but at the very least a willingness to learn and explore (I'm still working on my own ties as well). Someone that enjoys cuddling and preferably enjoys lifting people over their shoulder or playfully pinning them down to prevent them from getting up. Someone in the age group from 25 up to and including 29, open to a committed monogamous relationship.Some fluff is fine, but a reasonably healthy weight is a requirement if I am to find someone attractive. I wont deny that I also favour men that are around my height range or taller. Distance isn't necessarily a problem, I am however not interested in cross border pursuits or otherwise prohibiting encounters. &amp;nbsp; Above all, someone that values trust, communication and emotional vulnerability just as much as I do. In the case that this post piques your interest and you think we'd be a match, Id love hearing from you. &amp;nbsp; Id appreciate communication via DM's instead of Reddit chat."

I've been every kind of Top you can think of, and I am quite flexible with what kind of sub is right for me. What I really need is that devotion that only comes from submission. That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"

It's what I do, and I'm a little stoned (420) so you get a double dose. I'm looking for incredibly real connections. I think I can be a lot for a lot of people, but I know there are people I'm just right for, too, and I don't want you to like someone I'm pretending to be, and I don't want you to pretend. I want to make an honest effort to see if we connect. I'm not going to lie, the amount that I need from people is pretty high, but the amount that I give is similarly high. I'm looking for some fairly intensely emotional shit. I'm a sad girl a lot. I do a lot to work on my mental health, and I'm making progress, but I have a lot of stuff to work through, and tears are part of regular life. If you get what that's like, that might be helpful. It makes me fairly self-reflective and I think I have a pretty high emotional intelligence. I certainly can talk about it a fair amount at least. I process a lot of my feelings through venting/conversation, but I'm also a good listener (I tend towards the ""fix it"" side, but try to curb that impulse in myself). I want to know what makes you sad too, and I want to work on being happier, more whole versions of ourselves together. This does not mean I want you to be my therapist - I have one and she is fucking excellent as fuck - but my evolving mental health is a really big deal to me and plays a central role in my life right now. That being sad, my self-esteem is pretty high. I'm confident in who I am, what I want, and what I deserve in life, and if you're not rooting me on, I don't want you in my life. I will be glad to be mutually supportive to someone who supports me, but I'm not here to take care of you. I'll help you learn how to take care of yourself though. I'm down for that. I will be openly communicative about my needs, and will be sensitive to yours, but I will walk away from people who don't treat me well with no regrets. Not in like a conceited way, but like in a I'm going to tell you it's bullshit and if it continues, I'm out kind of way. On a related note: I am a fat woman. If you don't like that, don't message me. If you are messaging me because you think I'm the best you can do and you're settling, don't message me either. People seem to regularly assume that because I'm fat and THEY don't find that attractive that no one can find it attractive. I'm here to tell you that's not the case, and please don't do me the ""favor"" of messaging me. Work on your self-esteem and go for what you want, and leave me out of it. Be thoughtful, caring, and open. I say what I think, and I would like you to do the same. You don't have to be educated, but you should be thoughtful. Sometimes I'm funny and silly, a lot of times I have a fairly dark sense of humor (but damn is it funny), but I also care about being a responsible member of society. I try to stand up for what I believe in and care for and protect people around me, in a variety of ways. I would like you to think about the world around you and be able to imagine what it's like for people not like you. I would like you to have compassion and empathy for people, both in society at large and in your personal life. I truly like a nice, kind person. Not someone who is a quintessential ""good guy"" but like someone who actually has respect for other human beings and their autonomy, and who wants to be ""good"" because it feels good to be good. I think it feels good to put love and caring out there in the world. I want you to feel the same. And, I want someone who can talk about their emotions and life. Quick run down on important details/statuses: I am separated (long-term, and not reconciling), child-free (although I like children very much), I live with my mom (but have some privacy to live my own life), tomorrow is my last day at my job (I am really glad to get out of there, it was awful). I'm incredibly open-minded and try to be non-judgmental. I try to treat people around me well, and I will stand up and speak up for myself or others who are being mistreated. I am non-religious, but open to you believing what you want. If you have a high level of religiosity though, I imagine connecting would be harder. I'm pretty much a nerd - I was a reader, I'm highly educated, I game, etc. I fail at liking comics/manga and cartoons/anime though. I appreciate their quality, but they just don't grab me . I am not my interests, and you should be more than yours. I'm generally fairly logical/pragmatic in my approach to life, but I'm trying to get a better grasp on my emotional life and I'm letting that out here (hence the unstructured ramble). I am looking for: 30+ in age - this limit is fairly firm. I OCCASIONALLY will make an exception for 29. I'm open to up to about 45-ish, but I often have more in common with somewhat younger people. Honesty and openness - Tell me things that you are afraid to share Emotional intelligence Genuine kindness Empathy Availability Thoughtfulness/depth Vulnerability And randomly, I like to talk via discord, so please also have that If interested in the possibility for something romantic/sexual, I am additionally looking for: \- Someone single or at least not in a committed/primary relationship. I'm open to nonmonog/open/poly, but only in the right circumstances. People often lie about this. Don't. I'll find out and if I find out you lied to me, I'm done. I'm sorry if your marriage is sad, but find someone who's into that instead of lying to me about it. \- Don't assume I won't find you attractive/handsome. I'm not drawn to many things that are considered conventionally attractive, and maybe something you think is weird or unattractive about yourself will actually be something that I'm particularly attracted to. Attraction's a weird bear - take a chance. \- I have an incredibly high libido, and I am very open with regards to sexuality. I enjoy a lot and would need you to be reasonably sexually adventurous. You don't need to be super experienced, and this is something we could work up to, but if you know you've got a lot of hang-ups in this area, or you're just not super into it, we won't be a good match. &amp;#x200B; I attempt to reply to all serious messages where someone puts an effort into reading, understanding, and respecting what I am looking for. If you're clearly after something else, I may not reply. If you reply with something like ""what's up?"" I'm not going to reply either. You don't have to IMPRESS me with what you write - I'm not looking for you to perform - but I am looking for something vulnerable and real. I put myself out here like that for you, taking a chance - you should do the same. Hopefully we'll meet soon."
31,vulnerability,r4r,25 [F4R] Northern Virginia/DC Metro area - Let's locate our home frequencies together - friendships only  (long-ish),1,hqqozo,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/hqqozo/25_f4r_northern_virginiadc_metro_area_lets_locate/,2020-07-14 09:49:27,"Before you start reading this, I wrote it in no particular order so the flow might be a little all over the place. &amp;nbsp; My therapist asked me what friendship means to me, and I struggled to answer that. I know what some of my hopes are in a friendship, but I don't know have any personal definition of it. I want to understand the value with intentional exploration. &amp;nbsp; **I do have friends, but I met them when volunteering across the US, and they all live in different states, which is why I am searching for people in my area only.** &amp;nbsp; I really value people who I can learn from, listen to and also share with. Social awareness is a must. Not so much in terms of politics, but in acceptance of the human condition, and experience. I don't believe sensitivity is weakness, and boundaries are important. If you're upset about certain things not being ""socially acceptable"" to say or do, ask yourself why you want to do those things in the first place. At this point in my life, I can only accept people who are mentally healthy, or actively working towards health, as I am doing the same. &amp;nbsp; I've spent most of my time in the past volunteering and I would at some point like to get back to that, because it's been over a year, so please be open to doing (local?) service work with me at some point. A life not lived for others is not a life well lived. (I feel) I also would love to cook with someone later down the road. I love spending time in the kitchen making new (to me) things. If it's something you've made before and you're good at it, let's make that! This is probably where I should share that I eat a plant based diet. I love veganizing desserts! &amp;nbsp; For other things I'm interested in, an ideal ""outdoorsy"" day for me would definitely involve watching the birds (I will be buying binoculars soon), looking for insects, maybe riding a bike (I need to buy one at some point), or maybe going on a hike. I used to live in CO and AZ, and the hikes there were amazing. I've yet to hike in Virginia yet. I also REALLY want to kayak. I haven't done that since I was a kid. This may be out of place, but I do want to share that I am not a ""career driven"" kind of person. I am a VERY go with the flow kind of person. Money does not interest, nor does it drive me. I also feel like I should share that unfortunately, technology, and other geeky(?) things mostly bore me. I just really like the natural world a lot more. Now that I've shared that... &amp;nbsp; I'm hoping to develop this friendship over the course of the next few months to a year, and because of COVID, there is no expectation to meet any time soon. But DC area is still a must. Primarily looking for POC friends so we can share our (possibly relatable) experiences, but I am open to everyone of every nationality/ethnicity/race if we click. Another (I think) neat thing I would really like to do is make small care packages for the homeless. I actually work with at risk populations that experience homelessness, substance abuse and mental health struggles, etc., and I have a lot of compassion, understanding, and zero judgement. It would be nice to meet someone with similar sentiments. &amp;nbsp; I also would really like to visit some botanical gardens and parks, (esp. Roosevelt Island and bird watch) and maybe learn a new skill together, like bird identification, or a yoga pose, or how to plant care. Or anything you can think of! I am very nature oriented, as well as a very service oriented person. Kinda the energy I'm on most of the time. We could also have an audio book club! Or regular. But I would definitely be listening. I really prefer books that are educational in nature, but I'm open to books with POC protagonists as well, as the positive representation has been so important for my mental health. &amp;nbsp; I want to be in a healthy mental space where I can be on that ""no embarrassment, no shame"" energy I was on as a child with expression and comfortability (if that's not a word, it is now;) with myself. Before you knew what being judged felt like, and how damaging it can be, and I'm looking for a person or two, to compliment that. I'm searching for my ""home frequency,"" if you will. &amp;nbsp; Huge bonus if you speak another language. While I'm not currently learning any languages, before quarantine I was taking classes for Arabic and I've almost forgotten all of it with so much going on. (Egyptian) Arabic, Chinese, and Spanish are my biggest interests in learning basic communications, in that order. &amp;nbsp; Also, I am STILL learning. Always. To be patient, to be kind, to be supportive. Please don't be hesitant to tell me how you are really feeling about anything I may have said that is upsetting, or insensitive. This is OUR space, not just mine. I like having conversations about things that may not be talked about as much, like internalized racism, the parts of our culture we want to explore, the things you're afraid to tell even your friends - and why; who you wish you could be and what's stopping you - how you really feel (about anything.) Things along those lines. The stuff that makes us get defensive and close up, or that we are way excited about but feel silly sharing. The stuff we're afraid to say out loud, sometimes even to ourselves. &amp;nbsp; Let's be vulnerable together. I already like you if you've listened to Bren Brown's speech about vulnerability. &amp;nbsp; This is a safe space. It's okay to be yourself here. It's also okay if we aren't great matches. You can't get along with everyone, sometimes even if you really want to. &amp;nbsp; I do think it's important to note that I do not drink, or smoke. &amp;nbsp; HUGE points if you are into moving towards a zero/less waste lifestyle, especially if you're willing to teach/share skills like crafts/sewing/ repairing things. OR if you have a green thumb. I need someone like that in my life. I also have yet to go to the farmers market in this area, so that is also something new (for me, maybe both of us) to try. &amp;nbsp; ALSO, I did a visitors period of Twin Oaks Intentional Community 2 years ago, and I miss it, as well as other surrounding intentional communities focused on different aspects, such as environmentalism (Cambia), anarchy (Acorn), and zero fossil fuels farming (Living Energy Farm). If you're interested in visiting and volunteering on some farms around the area, that would be amazing! &amp;nbsp; Some other stuff that people generally tell others about themselves in these posts &amp;nbsp; * Music - I'm usually on a very heavy rotation between late 90's, early 00's R&amp;B and hip hop, some lo-fi, and quite a few artists on the Dreamville label and artists with similar sounds. Some favorites are Saba, Ari Lennox, EarthGang, JID, Boogie, Buddy, Isaiah Rashad, Kota the Friend, bLAck pARty, The Internet, Brent Faiyez, SiR, etc. I NEVER get tired of The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. I can listen to that album through and through. I really like music that touches my soul and soothes my worries, or validates my feelings. &amp;nbsp; * I already spoke about some of my favorite things to do outdoors, but I also love Runescape. I'm currently taking a break from it, but I only play Old School. Besides that though, I have zero interest in online games. I also do not (currently) watch TV shows, or Netflix/Hulu. I have watched the original X-Files 4 times though, and I used to watch tons of anime when I was younger. I also used to love survival horror games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Fatal Frame, Clocktower etc. &amp;nbsp; * I DO watch YouTube. Some of my favorite channels are DeepLook, Seeker, abetweene, Special Books by Special Kids, Ask a Mortician, Family in Northwest China, PBS Eons, Foo the Flowerhorn, Maangchi, Paul Thomas MD, and One More Please. I'm subscribed to probably 100 channels, but those ones I feel describe my interests best. I really like nature focused channels, ones focused on self care, and educational stuff. &amp;nbsp; * I LOVE grocery shopping. Spending a few hours between different stores, picking out things I've never tried before is really neat to me, especially in the produce section. It's a sort of gateway that leads to learning about other cultures and lifestyles for me. I probably eat more fruit that I do real food. &amp;nbsp; * Despite the down to earth energy in this post, in reality I have ZERO chill. I am very excitable in person, somewhat hyperactive, silly, and I will do crab dances in public that will probably embarrass you. I also do not run from wasps, and will share my food with them. I think that's important to share. &amp;nbsp; Like I said, this is a SAFE space, but that looks different, and means something different to everyone. We can figures ours out as we go. &amp;nbsp; Here are [some pictures](URL for making it this far  I shaved my head at the start of a very deep depression on December 31st, 2018. I'm happy to say my mental health has significantly improved since. The last picture I took less than an hour ago. &amp;nbsp; If you choose to reply, I would really appreciate knowing about (obtainable) things in this area you've wanted to try but haven't gotten to yet! Maybe a little about what you enjoy doing (before and during quarantine.) I'd also like to hear about how you prefer to communicate beyond Reddit. Tell me anything you think will catch my attention. If you can identify trees while on a walk, I might pick you. Lol. More important than anything, be honest ! Depending on how many replies I get, I (sadly) can't guarantee I'll be able to respond to everyone. &amp;nbsp; Thanks for reading, ya'll. I really do appreciate it "

You probably read the title and came here for jokes, didn't you? I'm here to disappoint, just like how dating has disappointed thousands and now we're all alcoholics. You know, hangovers and breakups have a lot in common; everything was better the night before, the world comes crashing down on the day of, and we keep coming back for more because we're all secretly masochists. For more useless (or uselessly useful if you're like me) thought experiments, please see below: * Is Harrison Ford more iconic as Indiana Jones, or Han Solo? * Why do people always say, *""I'm well, thanks""* in response to someone asking them how they are? It'd be nice to hear the truth once in a while, like, *""Well, my cat disowned me and I'm two months late on my rent, so I'm not doing so well, Karen. But, thanks.""* * If someone had a brain transplant, are they the same person? (Ship of Theseus parable ) &amp;nbsp; Outside of that, I like trying anything at least once (I know at least one person reading this immediately thought of butt stuff...pls take me out first at least) and will learn about/research something just for the hell of it. So, I'm also looking for someone sharing that kind of mindset. Whew, ok. That's all I really got for now. I have quite a few interests such as reading anything from non-fiction to fantasy manga, immersive detective shows like The Killing or sci-fi like The Expanse, writing reviews for music and other forms of media just for fun. I would go on, but I won't bore you with an exhaustive list at the moment. I'm looking for anything from being really good friends to a serious relationship (with a preference for the latter, obviously, otherwise why would I be here hahahah....\#singleAF). If you've read this far, I'm disappointed; you could have used that time far more productively (e.g. looking up cat gifs). Nonetheless, send me your favourite conspiracy theory because what better sign of intimacy and vulnerability is there than admitting that the government is hiding aliens from us?

Due to how things work down here everyone I meet is either a current client, a prospective client, another business owner or a close friend. This makes dating a challenge and with covid-19 traveling to meet others is very difficult when you are trying to run a business. I am 6 foot two, have golden blonde hair, green eyes and a thin athletic build. I have an undergraduate degree in economics, ten years of work experience in component level IT, am well traveled, socially adept, a practicing casual musician and life long martial artist. When I am not drowning myself in work I enjoy sitting in the sun, reading, watching the usual tv shows everyone else enjoys as well as cooking, hiking and being outdoors. I am seeking a long term relationship with a woman that values trust, emotional vulnerability, financial stability and who wants to build a future cemented in a foundation of success. If we are able to connect online and things seem like they could work in person this is an opportunity for you to start over in a new country devoid of your past experiences - a fresh start. I am an extremely serious person and I am looking for the same thing in return. If you have always been left wanting more this is your chance to start a life with someone who values purpose and meaning. A note: I am the person I am today due to past experience. Life is no longer fun it is real; I approach every aspect of my existence with this in mind."

I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few. I yearn for the other half of my dynamic, and I hope to meet someone for a lasting relationship. I love to teach, experience not necessary. I love eagerness to please. I dislike intolerance and closed-mindedness. As long as this post is up, please feel free to message me. I hope to hear from you!"

By being honest and sincere when developing the relationship, it allows us both to build something real with a solid foundation. So please feel the same way :) **What I Offer** Dick pics. Lots and lots of d--k pics. I don't know you in anyway, but I assume you feel attraction based on their quantity and medium. Right? I'll elevate the game to another level - I'm talking dick snail mail, flower dicks, cake dicks, and hell, I'll even fax dicks. I just wanted to show you I can hopefully make you FEEL something. Either through laughter because you're awesome and got my joke. Or disappointment, because you actually have a fax and wanted some d--k on that 8x11. Friendship is the most important thing I offer to start. That's where everything begins... **Who I AM** I'm a single, no kids, emotionally available, well educated man with a mysterious skill set that keeps me gainfully employed. I have a rapacious wit and enjoy dialogue on topics from politics to semantics :p I'm work hard to earn trust so that I'm able to have real and open communication with my partners. It's important to me to improve myself everyday while trying to be a good person and treating everyone with respect while making them laugh. Technology. Investment. Movies. Learning. Cuisine explorer. Adventure mastermind. I'm ready to find THE connection and looking for a woman whose ready for honesty and transparency. Plus, there's a whole world out there to explore and I want an adventure! Trust. Privacy. Respect. Vulnerability (both ways). Support. Understanding. **What You Offer** You enjoy life and know how to laugh through it all as well as random plagues. You WANT to have a man who can learn all about you. Even those ridiculously bad memes ONLY you find hilarious. While you are independent and having a great time, you are ready for someone who will complement you. You get excited about something! Be it your profession, hobbies, or attempting to be dresses with pockets famous. Bonus points for interesting skills, education, fashionista, adventure planning, and/or verbal banter :) Single. No children. Seeking LTR. Can make time available. Able to travel occasionally. Can supply private jet. **And Then...** In your reply tell me about yourself, why my post connects with you, and, why you need this type of relationship. So, please, if what I wrote connects with you let me know. Sometimes, it's the smallest action that can cause the biggest reaction. Especially if you have a fax machine!"

To build a bound and connection that leads to years together and possibly starting a family. A love that can communicate freely without the fear of judgement and one thats patient/passionate when things arent going well. I want to look forward in achieving my goals and sharing them with you, with you also willing to do the same. I would love to hear about what hobbies make you geek out or the endless stories about your day. More than anything I want a genuine connection with someone who can be a friend and lover. Hopefully we can meet when we fully commit to the relationship (and COVID-19 DIES LOL). I maybe a hopeless romantic but Im realistic in the way I love. I believe people should be allowed to love with all their heart, its the only time you experience that vulnerability and truly makes you feel human. About me briefly: I was in a 7yr toxic relationship that took a huge toll on me. I spent years having my boundaries never respected, constantly being lied to,gaslighted, manipulated,mistreated by ex and the family and even cheated on. This person ghosted me and just disappeared basically. - I get youre probably like ew RED FLAG TALKING ABOUT HIS EX but there is a point to this lmao  - I went to therapy and stayed single for 3 years to heal and love myself . I learned so much about maintaining healthy relationships, taking time to have my own identity outside the relationship and communicating effectively with my partner. During this time I found love again for the piano(still need to play it more lmao and relearn a lot of what I forgot), got back into writing poetry and am now even working on a book!(releasing it in google play first lmao ) and decided to redo my degree in a bachelors of science- 3d animation. I love storytelling and my hopes are to make my stories come to life in animation. These animations I want to make are to help inspire people or contribute to any conversations going on in the world(society). After I finish I want to get my master in art and media designand teach English in Japan for 1-2years. Its a hard decision to decide exactly what to do whether I should jump into the industry instantly or travel to a foreign country live there for a bit while teaching English and still building my resume.  I play video games when I have the time and also watch anime or literally anything on Netflix(Hulu,amazon prime,crunchy roll) thats good. ((Or has romance lmfao )) I spend my time learning a lot though obviously through school(animation/line art) but on my own like Japanese, music theory, guitar(this one is going to be awhile), software for my midi controllers to produce music , Korean(read somewhere that apparently you can learn the alphabet extremely easy so I want this) and astronomy . I have an interest in my many things so well definitely have something in common LMAOO Again distance doesnt mean anything to me BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA I travel their a lot to visit my brothers girlfriend who is family to me! We all end up chilling at an Airbnb (me and my brother split lol) and she takes us sightseeing! LOTS OF FOOD  I am 25 physically fit Currently I am 145-150 which is like skinny lean (been boxing more recently NO POOL BECAUSE OF COVID-19:-( ) But I can also be 155-165 bulked up which is a great weight class for when I box lmao but having all that muscle would tire me out and maintenance was a bitch .  TLDR: Imagine by Ariana Grande Yuh."

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a little silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to them. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most people dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want."

Hope you are doing well amidst this COVID hoopla. :) When I first came here, admittedly I was pretty lonely. I thought that being in a relationship would make things better and my tunnel vision for it was unrelenting. But the more I think about it, that's not the most important thing. I've had relationship L's (quite a few lol) and bouncing back from them has been tough. I know though that I can grow from them and be better. With that being said, although a relationship is something I want, what everyone needs is a friend. With the way COVID has impacted us the last few months, I know it means a lot to have someone you can share &amp; enjoy your life with (be it the ups and downs and everything in between). I've met some cool ppl here that's definitely made life worthwhile. Hopefully I can continue that with others too. I know some of u are thinking, that's the long-winded dude speaking about vulnerability, blah blah blah lol. But that's important to me; I'm not ashamed of it. Who doesn't want compassion, kindness, sincerity and empathy in their relationships? I'm sure it's important to others here as well. I hope to show (if given the chance) that I'm genuine. Actions speak louder than words, but since we're not face-to-face, I want my words to show that I really care about the ppl I meet. If you want to chat, or if there's anything on your mind, I'm all ears. :) I'm always down for good laughs and vibes too. Most likely you'll be laughing at me a lot (relationships aren't the only L's I've taken; wait till I tell u the treadmill story lol) but that's no problem. We all need laughs like this to reflect on the many things in life that we can be thankful for. So try your best humor/jokes/memes on me. If u have time, check my previous posts for a little bit on what I do (or like to do). I feel like although pharmacy and baking cakes can be pretty sweet, that's surface level. Building something that's deeper isn't easy but I'm in it for the long run. How about u? Hit me up if this resonates with you at all. And if not, thanks a lot for taking the time to read this (and for your posts in general; it takes a lot of courage &amp; vulnerability to do so). :) P.S. - That's me (on your left - I hope someone got that reference lol): [URL"

Due to how things work down here everyone I meet is either a current client, a prospective client, another business owner or a close friend. This makes dating a challenge and with covid-19 traveling to meet others is very difficult when you are trying to run a business. I am 6 foot two, have golden blonde hair, green eyes and a thin athletic build. I have an undergraduate degree in economics, ten years of work experience in component level IT, am well traveled, socially adept, a practicing casual musician and life long martial artist. When I am not drowning myself in work I enjoy sitting in the sun, reading, watching the usual tv shows everyone else enjoys as well as cooking, hiking and being outdoors. I am seeking a long term relationship with a woman that values trust, emotional vulnerability, financial stability and who wants to build a future cemented in a foundation of success. If we are able to connect online and things seem like they could work in person this is an opportunity for you to start over in a new country devoid of your past experiences - a fresh start. I am an extremely serious person and I am looking for the same thing in return. If you have never been in a long term relationship this is not for you; what I have to offer isn't a fairy tale but a real, uncompromising connection with someone who has lived life at its best and its worst. Do you have what it takes to love?"

I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can.

I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

I read tarot cards and I love helping people through coaching and also teaching foreign languages on the side to make a living. I am married, polyamorous, and I live with my only current partner and a cat in a 600 old house in Italy. I also have some chronic illnesses that have made me a very strong person. I love reading books, playing videogames, listening to music and making hundreds of playlists, watching movies and videos on Youtube to learn more about spiritual topics and psychology. I also cook and bake very healthy food and I know a ton about nutrition. Ask me about it if you're interested! I really enjoy talking about everything. I also loved to travel before this pandemic situation and I've seen almost half of Europe, a bit of British Columbia (Canada), and some Thailand and Japan too! Another activity I was really into some time ago is snail mail exchange but the post has just stopped working basically and I am sad for that! **Other labels of mine**: INFJ, Capricorn sun with a Capricorn stellium in the 6th house (if you're into astrology that's a plus but it's definitely okay if you think it's bullshit as well), empath, kitchen witch who likes to cook staple recipes for comfort food. What I'd like to do together with you: &amp;#x200B; * Keep each other accountable and daily (or weekly too) check in with each other. Have you had a proper breakfast today? Have you slept well? How do do you feel? What are your intentions and goals at the moment? Who made you smile today? &amp;#x200B; * Exchange music if you think we could have similar taste. Some of my current favorite artists are: Tom Rosenthal, Olafur Arnalds, Christian, Christian Lffler, Message to Bears, Jon Hopkins, Chelsea Wolfe, Dead Can Dance, Anna von Hausswolff. &amp;#x200B; * Play Animal Crossing together. I am not trying to be rich or have a million objects in the game. I'd just like to hang out with someone and give each other presents. &amp;#x200B; Just generally talk about anything I've mentioned in my description above. Let's share some pictures too instead of using Instagram stories just to brag about how productive you can be during this time that'd require more self-care instead. (Just my honest opinion) I try to live my life offline too so I can assure you'll always be online to talk. &amp;#x200B; \+ [Some pictures of me.](URL (dm me for my favorite movies, what books I am reading and my favorite quotes)"

If I'm depressed or anxious, or feeling silly, I can just share that and know that I won't be judged or receive knowing, superior comments. I think having a range of emotions is part of being human. People have told me I tend towards optimism, but it's not a blind optimism based on not seeing the situation as it is, and it doesn't involve attempts to trick my emotions into being something different. I tend to think a lot and analyse things, which is pleasurable to me (for the most part). I'm trying to channel this into writing and that feels exciting somehow. Even the thought of having a little blog with a very small readership, but which is full of writing that I personally am proud of, feels exciting to me because it feels like something real, and not only that but a concrete action to connect more deeply with the world. I know it's just online posts, but the effort that went into it and the sincerity and craft of it will make it something real. Sometimes I take on too many things at once, exciting projects and language learning and lifestyle changes all at the same time. I am trying to pick one or two things to do at once. After I get the blog on track my next project might be learning Python. I missed being naked with someone yesterday, quite concretely. It wasn't a sexual thing. I just missed that feeling of intimacy. trust, and vulnerability of being with someone you can be naked with. It's been a while since I had that. I want to become more actively involved in politics. I wouldn't describe myself as depoliticized but my politics has tended towards intellectualism and passivity. It's not that it's wrong to be well-read on political theory or anything, but over the last few years there's not been much of a connection to the real world. I vote, but I feel like I should be involved with a movement of some kind, even a really flawed one that's not going to lead society as far towards justice as I would like. Because sometimes even starting from anywhere with any worthy goal can lead you towards the next place, although that's not to say I am going to support some equivocal bullshit. I've been enjoying Matt Christman's vlogs lately. They've been pushing me towards basic, concrete actions in a number of ways and it's been really healthy. It would be cool to have someone to watch shows with. I think I'm a supportive and honest person. I'm definitely not perfect, but I really believe in people and have a fierce desire to encourage people to believe in themselves. I reach out to people to communicate with them when I feel like there's a chance to make understanding happen. I really dislike people who don't seek to understand the perspectives of others and are overly confident of their own perspective, believing in their subjective opinion as objective truth, and don't tend to get on well with those types of people. But message me anyway, if something resonates. No one is excluded."

I vote, but I feel like I should be involved with a movement of some kind, even a really flawed one that's not going to lead society as far towards justice as I would like. Because sometimes even starting from anywhere with any worthy goal can lead you towards the next place, although that's not to say I am going to support some equivocal bullshit. I've been enjoying Matt Christman's vlogs lately. They've been pushing me towards basic, concrete actions in a number of ways and it's been really healthy. It would be cool to have someone to watch shows with. I think I'm a supportive and honest person. I'm definitely not perfect, but I really believe in people and have a fierce desire to encourage people to believe in themselves. I reach out to people to communicate with them when I feel like there's a chance to make understanding happen. I really dislike people who don't seek to understand the perspectives of others and are overly confident of their own perspective, believing in their subjective opinion as objective truth, and don't tend to get on well with those types of people. But message me anyway, if something resonates. No one is excluded."
61,vulnerability,r4r,26 [M4F] MA/RI -- Any love for a useless softie?,1,h022dm,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/h022dm/26_m4f_mari_any_love_for_a_useless_softie/,2020-06-10 12:34:15,"Just testing the waters to see if anyone is interested in a broken toy like me. As a vanilla sexual partner, you'd probably consider me fairly useless. Without a condom I cum very quickly, and with a condom I either still cum within a few minutes or the lack of sensation softens my erection. Despite being extremely horny I often only get half hard, and it can take a lot of stimulation to get that far. I'm able to cum without being completely hard (and even when I'm nearly completely soft), which as you might imagine can be fairly humiliating. Maybe it's due to association or because of my experiences in the kink scene, but over time the humiliation aspects of all of this has turned into a fetish; SPH, being forced to orgasm while soft (e.g. with a hitachi), being ridiculed while attempting to have normal sex, etc, have all become major fantasies for me. For much longer than I've had those kinks I've been involved in BDSM and kink, and I've had a lot of experience as a submissive both online and in real-life scenes. My kinks as a sub include light humiliation, pain play, impact play, chastity and orgasm control, ruined orgasms, cum eating, body worship, choking, mental play and mind fuckery, etc. I enjoy anal play and when it's done right it's incredibly pleasurable and will thoroughly melt my brain and make me useless for a few hours, though that's easy to do in general because it's very, very easy for me to hit sub-space. I suppose all this doesn't come as too much of a surprise. My relationship with kink is complicated, and it's not something I just turn off my brain to do. Like I said I hit sub-space very, very easily, and when I do I go deep. The complicated side of that characteristic is that there's a significant loss of control that can happen with very little work, and needless to say there's a ton of vulnerability that goes along with that. A lot of this stuff is genuinely humiliating for me and there's plenty of different feelings wrapped up in them, so a casual and open friendship and a good amount of physical affection outside of the kinky stuff is absolutely required. Here's a little bit more about myself outside of the kink related stuff (feel free to pm me for a photo): I'm white, 5'8"", big muscles from weight training but basically a dad-bod. I work in a STEM field and recently moved back to the central MA/Worcester area. I'm a softie in pretty much every meaning of the word. I'm very affectionate once things develop but I'm usually pretty shy when meeting new people, or at least when I'm meeting them due to a kink thing. I'm gender-affirming and open to talking to anyone with the strong exception of cis-men and people who identify as masculine; I'm cis and identify as straight. Thanks for reading! If I sound like someone that has something to offer you than send me a PM :)"
62,vulnerability,r4r,27 [M4F] Toronto - Let's get controversial; Do you hang your toilet paper under or over?,2,h0pkox,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/h0pkox/27_m4f_toronto_lets_get_controversial_do_you_hang/,2020-06-11 11:47:41,"If you answered 'under' then you're a certified heretic and might need to reevaluate your life choices. Just kidding, it's understandable to do so if you have pets and/or little kids that can quickly unravel a roll. Otherwise, I'm curious as to why'd you make it harder for yourself because over seems like the right way to do it. Anyway, all of this will be irrelevant in 10 years when touchless toilet paper dispensers become affordable for the average household (this is a selfish wish as you can tell). Two months ago talking about toilet paper induced a public panic, so I'm glad we're back to taking comfort in our regularly scheduled bathroom routines. For more useless (or uselessly useful if you're like me) thought experiments, please see below: * Is Harrison Ford more iconic as Indiana Jones, or Han Solo? * Why do people always say, *""I'm well, thanks""* in response to someone asking them how they are? It'd be nice to hear the truth once in a while, like, *""Well, my cat disowned me and I'm two months late on my rent, so I'm not doing so well, Karen. But, thanks.""* * If someone had a brain transplant, are they the same person? (Ship of Theseus parable ) &amp;nbsp; Outside of that, I like trying anything at least once (I know at least one person reading this immediately thought of butt stuff...pls take me out first at least) and will learn about/research something just for the hell of it. So, I'm also looking for someone sharing that kind of mindset. Whew, ok. That's all I really got for now. I have quite a few interests such as reading anything from non-fiction to fantasy manga, immersive detective shows like The Killing or sci-fi like The Expanse, writing reviews for music and other forms of media just for fun. I would go on, but I won't bore you with an exhaustive list at the moment. I'm looking for anything from being really good friends to a serious relationship (with a preference for the latter, obviously, otherwise why would I be here hahahah....\#singleAF). If you've read this far, I'm disappointed; you could have used that time far more productively (e.g. looking up cat gifs).

64,vulnerability,r4r,33 [M4F] Alberta / Online - I miss you...every day.,1,h8sig2,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/h8sig2/33_m4f_alberta_online_i_miss_youevery_day/,2020-06-14 21:55:19,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey there, my name is Jordan, 33/M/Alberta Canada, looking for a lovely lady (CIS / MtF: ). I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

On one hand, you can brake hard and burn your brake pads as well as cause a rear-end collision, or you can gun it, risk a speeding offence, and/or get into a T-bone accident. What do you think?

That kind of gratification and control and vulnerability that can only be shared by the kinky among us. I'm based near London, in Kent. I drive. I am a business owner. I'm a firm but fair Master with a lot of experience under my belt. I love to make things. I love to better myself and my property too. Trainer. Sadist. Cuddler. Owner. I don't have a type, but I dislike too much bratting, I prefer a good girl. Kinks are many and varied, limits few.

76,vulnerability,r4r,33 [M4F] Alberta/Online - I want to wake up next to you.,1,hi0wfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/hi0wfz/33_m4f_albertaonline_i_want_to_wake_up_next_to_you/,2020-06-30 00:31:27,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey there, my name is Jordan, 33/M/Alberta Canada, looking for a lovely lady (CIS / MtF: ). I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want.

Or maybe something more in vogue like Joe Exotic socks with a quote of *""Carole Baskin totally killed her husband""* on the bottom. And then you *lose* one to your dryer. How terrible. You have mismatched socks and your life will never be as complete as it once was. If that's anything like trying to find someone with mutual interests, then I get it. For more useless (or uselessly useful if you're like me) thought experiments, please see below: * Is Harrison Ford more iconic as Han Solo, or Indiana Jones? * Why do people always say, *""I'm well, thanks""* in response to someone asking them how they are? It'd be nice to hear the truth once in a while, like, *""Well, my cat disowned me and I'm two months late on my rent, so I'm not doing so well, Karen. But, thanks.""* * If someone had a brain transplant, are they the same person? (Ship of Theseus parable ) &amp;nbsp; Outside of that, I like trying anything at least once (I know at least one person reading this immediately thought of butt stuff...pls take me out first at least) and will learn about/research something just for the hell of it. So, I'm also looking for someone sharing that kind of mindset. Whew, ok. That's all I really got for now. I have quite a few interests such as reading anything from non-fiction to fantasy manga, immersive detective shows like The Killing or sci-fi like The Expanse, writing reviews for music and other forms of media just for fun. I would go on, but I won't bore you with an exhaustive list at the moment. I'm looking for anything from being really good friends to a serious relationship (with a preference for the latter, obviously, otherwise why would I be here hahahah....\#singleAF). If you've read this far, I'm disappointed; you could have used that time far more productively (e.g. looking up cat gifs).

79,vulnerability,r4r,"21 [T4M] Australia - Young, lonely university student looking for male friendships and connections (preference for US LEOs/military men)",1,gd8272,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gd8272/21_t4m_australia_young_lonely_university_student/,2020-05-04 18:57:57," Hi guys, I'm Cassie (at least that's my female name I've given to myself), posted here a few times and haven't had any matches in prospective people to connect with. I'll guess I keep trying until I have something worth of a reply... which is why I'm here! It doesn't help that people my age and generation are ones I feel I'm lacking in connection. Maybe it's because of my niche interests, or me pursuing my rather specific wants. At least the perks of posting is you being the judge and being able to filter who you feel you could be warm with to share correspondence with. So I am looking for any old, gentle souls out there, preferably older people to make friends with. Unfortunately, for many young people like me, I'm one of the souls not into anime, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, watching Netflix, greatly enthused about memes, ""looking for a deep convo/quarantine buddies"" etc. that I find often in many posts... especially for a Gen Z'er born a year before Y2K. So feeling like an outcast can certainly be very sobering, and certainly I feel no stranger to it. I've felt one near my whole life. Didn't have a place to belong. Recently, I've decided to quietly part ways with a university bible study group I've joined not too long ago, after finding out they were treading into the wayward ways of devolving into a gossip group of a book club. Partly also, my struggles in re-introducing faith into my life was somewhat I could not come to terms with. With that in mind, I'm forging my own friendships, choosing the company I surround with my life, against all reservations and judgments. I'm subtly cutting all ties with the people I know even on Facebook, and met in passing. Friendships... what do they mean to me? Everyone has their own definition but I'm not like everyone.... or else I'd be a talking parrot. Where we share our vulnerabilities, our needs and desires are unashamed. One where I could trust you and hopefully vice versa. Unvarnished honesty, kindness, trust and understanding is what I want. A deep-rooted friendship at the core of it. Every day, I feel no one has taken the initiative or willingness to understand me, I don't have anyone in my life to have a best friend long-term, and my very few friends from high school are growing distant, even had the unfortunate obnoxious and obtuse ass of a friend I've blocked after telling me I was miserable. I don't even have a long-term male best friend that I made in university! I want to feel angry at the world and give the middle finger, right now, I'm completely apathetic to what's happening, for the loss of the things people are experiencing right now, my life was equally miserable and no different before. Having to grieve or lose a life I could've had in the past, being repressed, when many things didn't pan out right. Reaching to the point, where I'd feel like I want to run away and live somewhere very rural. That is somewhat my baggage. I'm giving a chance though if there is anyone out there that I could connect with. I want a friend who is willing to take the chance of being vulnerable. Write long messages as equally I am, describing every thoughts and feelings you have, sparing no details. The chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and I'd very much like someone to frequently talk and correspond to long-term. I'm not looking for any therapists nor am I seeking anyone looking to offer me platitudes that I've grown numb to. Chances are, you're not the first person to ever tell me what it is you're thinking. I'm looking for specific people, in environments and career that are able to get on my level, and for me to get on theirs. Any one interested in a prospective friendship, feel free to PM. **About me:** Asian-Australian, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital). **Dislikes:** bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Watching raw footage of crime scenes, traffic accidents and/or police incidents (check Loudlabs news and Loudlabs news nyc in yt) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Aviation, aviation flight trip reports * Anything US military related. Equipment, gear, guns, lingo... I probably wouldn't know half of it but I'll quietly nod yes as your drone out anything in detail. * Military MREs food reviews * Reading. Currently aiming to read ""Towards a New Maritime Strategy: American Naval Thinking in the Post Cold-War Era"". Other books that I have read include: Shortest Way Home by Pete Buttigieg, Winter of the World/Edge of Eternity book series by Ken Follett, The Strain, Wayward Pines book series, World War Z by Max Brooks * Music: Outlaw country/country rock/classic rock/southern rock/Motown/Philadelphia sound/R&amp;B/Blue-eyed soul/a bit of Irish-Gaelic (a big favorite is Bear McCreary - Wander My Friends and some other songs from the same artist: Kat's Sacrifice, Pegasus, Prelude to War). My song anthem: [URL * TV shows: Battlestar Galactica, LOST, COPS (especially S1), 12 Monkeys, Person of Interest, West Wing, The Newsroom * Other interesting random tidbits about me: Choice of gun is a Glock 33 .357SIG, favorite instruments are piano and Uilleann pipes **You:** * Non-married or partnered * Open-minded, kind, very understanding * 18-53 (preferably 30+) * Not starting your first message as a simple ""Hey"" or ""Hey there"" but the more you describe yourself about you, the more likely I'll give you a chance. If you give me something brief, I'll be less enthused about it and I'll probably give you a pass. Take your time if you want to tell me about yourself in-depth. This isn't Twitter where there is no character limits. ***Disclaimer:*** I do have a certain preference for **US LEOs/military men** ***(Army, Navy, Marines, AF, Coast Guard... darn right I included the coast guard lol)*** as my interests are more orientated towards law enforcement/military somewhat though open to others who are not. Yes, If you find that gives you an expression of silent disapproval that I'm being too selective, I suggest you hightail that disapproval elsewhere. On the more humorous end, I live in a country with non-outrageous premiums, out-of-pocket costs and a dream medicare-for-all system and I'm still very lonely! I doubt me mooching off your BAH/Tricare or that E-4 pay will get me anywhere ***(kudos if you get that godawful joke).*** In all seriousness, I know how lack of vulnerability in a hyper masculine environment such as policing or being in the military can be exhausting. Whether coming home from a exhausting shift and taking your police vest that smells like Nachos, or dreading the eventual Chinese field day in the barracks...from Rota to Bagram or from Pendleton to Lejeune, maybe the desire for some semblance of normalcy is something you're seeking, being away from home. Maybe I can help you talk it out, to express that need. Perhaps this is just my inner caretaker nurse speaking.... or it's some random mumbo-jumbo."

I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life.

We guard ourselves now despite having free reign and little to lose. Our day to day lives, our jobs, places we go, our regular motions so deeply affect our personalities. With those being taken from us, many of us think who am I now without my tasks? The fear of being perceived incorrectly has always driven me to great lengths to be myself. Not a version of myself, my whole honest self. I wonder why people think vulnerability is so brave when it is so human and one of the greatest things we are capable of being at this point in time. So thats all I have to offer anyone at this time. No judgement or shame, I just ask for the same thing. I dont know, things are weird, its easy to feel lonely and worthless but I would implore you to be yourself more than ever. This could be an opportunity for you to become your biggest fan and share that. I dont think people are searching for content right now, I think theyre searching for humanity and I would love to see and like all of yours."

Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."
88,vulnerability,r4r,28 [M4F] - 36 Questions to Bring People Closer Together,1,gg442t,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gg442t/28_m4f_36_questions_to_bring_people_closer/,2020-05-09 09:22:29," I think we're all feeling a little vulnerable being stuck at home during these times. I'm up for leaning into the vulnerability and get to know people on a much deeper level. Below are a list of 36 questions that are designed to increase closeness among people. I think it would be cool to REALLY get to know someone today. If you think we could get through all of them, lets take turns asking each question to one another. The Questions: **Set I** 1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest? 2. Would you like to be famous? In what way? 3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why? 4. What would constitute a perfect day for you? 5. When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? 6. If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you want? 7. Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? 8. Name three things you and your partner appear to have in common. 9. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? 10. If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? 11. Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible. 12. If you could wake up tomorrow having gained any one quality or ability, what would it be? **Set II** 13. If a crystal ball could tell you the truth about yourself, your life, the future, or anything else, what would you want to know? 14. Is there something that youve dreamed of doing for a long time? Why havent you done it? 15. What is the greatest accomplishment of your life? 16. What do you value most in a friendship? 17. What is your most treasured memory? 18. What is your most terrible memory? 19. If you knew that in one year you would die suddenly, would you change anything about the way you are now living? Why? 20. What does friendship mean to you? 21. What roles do love and affection play in your life? 22. Alternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner. Share a total of five items. 23. How close and warm is your family? Do you feel your childhood was happier than most other peoples? 24. How do you feel about your relationship with your mother? **Set III** 25. Make three true we statements each. For instance, We are both in this room feeling 26. Complete this sentence: I wish I had someone with whom I could share 27. If you were going to become a close friend with your partner, please share what would be important for him or her to know. 28. Tell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time, saying things that you might not say to someone youve just met. 29. Share with your partner an embarrassing moment in your life. 30. When did you last cry in front of another person? By yourself? 31. Tell your partner something that you like about them \[already\]. 32. What, if anything, is too serious to be joked about? 33. If you were to die this evening with no opportunity to communicate with anyone, what would you most regret not having told someone? Why havent you told them yet? 34. Your house, containing everything you own, catches fire. After saving your loved ones and pets, you have time to safely make a final dash to save any one item. What would it be? Why? 35. Of all the people in your family, whose death would you find most disturbing? Why? 36. Share a personal problem and ask your partners advice on how he or she might handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen."

A friend of mine shared an old NYT article the other day called ""36 questions that lead to love"". I read through the questions and while I dont think it'll ""lead to love!"", I do think it could lead to a deeper connection with somebody, and that's something I'd like in my life. So here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to exchange a few message via reddit PM and establish that 1) I find you interesting, 2) I find you attractive, and 3) I'd like to \\\*really\\\* get to know you. Eventually I'd like to arrange a time to get on a video chat and go through the 36 questions. Some of them require vulnerability so we should both be ready for that. Here's a little about me without getting too specific. I can be an intense person. I feel things deeply and like to talk about emotions and mental health. When life gets difficult, I like to take myself on adventures in the mountains; I find it therapeutic to be at the summit of a climb or hike and stare out into the expanse and feel small. I find outlets in running and dancing and psychedelics. I love mind puzzles (climbing, coding, board games) and I love getting lost in other worlds (video games, TV shows, movies, or books). I like creating things. I care a lot about people. I have some (PG-13ish) photos in my post history, and can share face photos upon request. I just ask that you are emotionally available (preferably single), are within 27-40, and are willing to open up and be vulnerable with a stranger on the internet. Feel free to look up the article and skim the questions before messaging! Please include a little bit about yourself in your first message, and maybe a little something about why this exercise interests you. Idk what to expect really, but I hope this leads to something interesting! "

I'm looking for some good conversations :) I'm not into small talk and prefer deeper topics. Like, I find it boring to talk about what I do for work/school. There are more interesting things about a person than their occupation (hopefully). I love finding those connections that make me smile when I check my phone. A little bit about me and my interests: I love nature, animals, and spending time outdoors (missing camping rn). I also love discovering new music (I'm mostly into indie, folk, and hip hop but open to genres) and like going to live shows. Baking and cooking are some of my biggest passions, especially while spending so much time inside lately. I love facts and science but also like exploring astrology, cryptids, and other off-beat topics. I love art! Making it, appreciating it, etc. Some of my other hobbies include falling down youtube rabbit holes, knitting, yoga, and playing board games. Personality wise I'm pretty down to earth. I can be very rambly about topics I'm into but also enjoy listening to someone who's passionate about their interests. I love to learn. I like to be silly with the right people. I like mutual vulnerability. Okay that was long but if any of that sounds appealing to you, shoot me a message! Location doesn't matter to me, but I'd prefer if you're 24+."

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."
93,vulnerability,r4r,33 [M4F] Alberta/Online - Thinking of you..,1,gikydc,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gikydc/33_m4f_albertaonline_thinking_of_you/,2020-05-13 07:34:11,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey there, my name is Jordan, 33/M/Alberta Canada, looking for a lovely lady (CIS / MtF: ). I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful thing I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."
95,vulnerability,r4r,27 [M4F] Toronto - You know that feeling when you realize that your dryer ate your sock?,1,gkmwsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gkmwsy/27_m4f_toronto_you_know_that_feeling_when_you/,2020-05-16 12:29:52,"Maybe you recently got some fun socks like a coffee themed pair that says *""Pot Head""* with a smiling coffee pot. Or maybe something more in vogue like Joe Exotic socks with a quote of *""Carole Baskin totally killed her husband""* on the bottom. And then you *lose* one to your dryer. How terrible. You have mismatched socks and your life will never be as complete as it once was. If that's anything like trying to find someone with mutual interests, then I get it. For more useless (or uselessly useful if you're like me) thought experiments, please see below: * Is Harrison Ford more iconic as Indiana Jones, or Han Solo? * Why do people always say, *""I'm well, thanks""* in response to someone asking them how they are? It'd be nice to hear the truth once in a while, like, *""Well, my cat disowned me and I'm two months late on my rent, so I'm not doing so well, Karen. But, thanks.""* * If someone had a brain transplant, are they the same person? (Ship of Theseus parable ) &amp;nbsp; Outside of that, I like trying anything at least once (I know at least one person reading this immediately thought of butt stuff...pls take me out first at least) and will learn about/research something just for the hell of it. So, I'm also looking for someone sharing that kind of mindset. Whew, ok. That's all I really got for now. I have quite a few interests such as reading anything from non-fiction to fantasy manga, immersive detective shows like The Killing or sci-fi like The Expanse, writing reviews for music and other forms of media just for fun. I would go on, but I won't bore you with an exhaustive list at the moment. I'm looking for anything from being really good friends to a serious relationship (with a preference for the latter, obviously, otherwise why would I be here hahahah....\#singleAF). If you've read this far, I'm disappointed; you could have used that time far more productively (e.g. looking up cat gifs). Nonetheless, send me your favourite conspiracy theory because what better sign of intimacy and vulnerability is there than admitting that the government is hiding aliens from us?

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete"

He's inside the townhouse behind me. **Objectives** - Send OP a private message, being sure to include your age, general location, game genre preferences, fondest gaming memory, and ~~boobs~~ opinion regarding pineapple on pizza.

For now I have a wonderful career that Im hoping COVID-19 doesnt take away. I really want the experience of getting to know someone new and hopefully having a voice call, maybe video later. If it leads to something spectacular even better! I would like to find someone who were share a physical attraction with, because a little harmless flirting never hurt during this pandemic. Im 59 and around 170, and of course I will provide pictures when we kick it off! Im all about podcasts, finding new books and shows, and endlessly wandering through Wikipedia and documentaries.

This is the first time this week Im feeling this way.* ***I want to keep feeling this way.*** &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Hi there, Im Dean. I suppose this is the part where I explain my self-ambivalence. Meet Hank, Hector, and Harvey. Each element describes fairly distinctive part of my personality. *(Although I swear I dont have split personality disorder)* &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Meet Hank the** ***Teddy Bear.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Towering men of power, that look like they cant hurt a fly. Gentle, caring, quirky, and funny. (Thats right ladies, a fucking Oxford Comma!)  Hank will always know how youre doing, even before you tell him. Hell know when youve conquered your day at work, and hell know when youre upset. Hell worry about you until you let him cheer you up. Hank likes flirty conversations, being affectionate, and is a complete whore for cuddles. Laugh at Hanks jokes, its his big weakness. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Hector, the** ***Broken.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Men that are a little broken, a little beaten down. Men that usually hide this part of their personality (often, not as well as they think). Hector has good days and bad days. On good days, Hector will go for long walks on the beach with you, watch sunsets, and paint your nails. On bad days, Hector just wants you to be patient with him. He doesnt want you to try and solve things (really, hes thought of everything), he just wants you around. He wants you to make conversation, and care just a little. Random-ass kisses help too. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Harvey, the** ***Kinky.*** Youll know the type of men Im describing. Men that pride themselves on being good at reading others, and situations. Men that are intelligent, measured, and dominant. Harvey will earn your trust, your vulnerability, and your submission. Hell be the happiest man in the world, when your toes are curled, and your fingers are grasping at the sheets in sweet agony. Tell Harvey about that kink you always wanted to explore, or that fantasy you cant seem to get out of your head. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If youre still here, and theres a smile on your face you cant quite explain, please know that I am over the moon. I love making people smile and laugh. Also, if you are smiling at this (and arent screaming in horror?) maybe youre exactly what Im looking for. Maybe you have your self-ambivalence youd like to tell me about?  If you do decide to message me, I should be upfront about my love for voices and by extension, voice calls. After all, why endure the pain of being misunderstood over text, when I can revel at the sound of your sweet laugh?  Have a great day / night!

For more about me, I'm an English major working towards becoming an ESL teacher in a few years. I enjoy reading fantasy books, DnD, story-based RPGs, anime, Kdramas, and also crocheting.

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

I am looking for someone with whom I can share my thoughts and emotions, and experience intimacy. This may be a friendship, or a relationship, or whatever is in between. I know not all personalities agree, so here are the results of a personality test I took. It is mostly accurate! (Very introverted..) URL Little bit about me, I am currently a grad student doing my MS in Statistics, after having completed my bachelor's in math. I used to privately tutor students in calculus and physics. So, I am a big nerd! I like sci-fi and anime, ! I see life a little bit like an RPG. In an effort to escape my comfort zones and increase my extroversion stat, I became a cop. Here is a photo! URL I learned a lot about life working in law enforcement. I've gone into people's homes and intimately been a part of their most tragic and heartbreaking moments. One group of girls lost a friend to overdose, and her boyfriend was devastated. On the surface these girls looked completely fine, but after meeting with them and their parents, I got to see, they have their issues, insecurities, and imperfections, just like everyone else. Another instance, we found a girl's father dead in his apartment. That was a tragic day, she never expected it. My point being, even though people paint themselves perfectly on social media, it does not at all indicate how their lives truly are. Because ""who wants to see that""? But I think that concept is just comes from the fear of rejection. I believe everybody wants to be seen, especially at their darkest moments. Perhaps it is nave, but I believe people would do this, if they weren't afraid of getting hurt. Point being, I believe vulnerability and intimacy are crucial to emotional well-being! I am a person who likes to keep things real, because, things are real! I believe is best to act honestly and forthrightly in the world. I don't like facades, beating around the bush, or untruths in general. Anyways, I think that's long enough of a post. If you want to get to know me better just shoot me a DM! Wishing you are all healthy and safe, Michael"

My perspectives in life change a lot, and idk, if I re-wrote this I probably would make it a lot more simpler, but, I am going to give it a chance like this. Anyways, MDLB is a lifestyle -- if you don't know what it is, I'm probably not for you, unless you're willing to learn?) Kind of a long post -- trying to explain some of my history, what MDLB is for me, what I'm looking for in a MDLB relationship, ext ext. I like to think I'm a somewhat a special little boy, so hey, give it a chance maybe? I'm also putting so much effort in this post, because I am trying to find the lady that I can spend the rest of my life with. BTW -- Sorry if this is a hard post to read though. Tiredness + ADHD + littleness, not a good combo for writing clearly. I am pretty much a permanent little I guess? Meaning not just some phase I go into, but who I am. Honestly, I'm still going through a period of self-discovery, so who knows what will happen? Plus, I do not tell fortunes -- the future is a mystery. When I was younger, I had a lot of childhood trauma, and past childhood had a lot of issues. For most of my life, I was concerned with philosophy and religion and complicated things. Then, I recently found MDLB. I've almost come up with a new way of life, based on MDLB alone lol. If you want to see some of the philosophy, ask, and I'll write something. I am a Christian, and that's pretty important to me. I have explored I think most of the ways of the earth -- all major religions, tribal beliefs, occultism ways, new and old ways, philosophy -- blah blah blah. I have spent basically my entire life dedicated to these things, ""searching for the truth"". I have found the truth, and that is Christianity. If you'd ever like to discuss religion, spirituality, go ahead and PM me -- you would be surprised how much I know of the mystery -- but besides that, if you don't share the same beliefs as me (Christianity), we will probably not work out so well, because I will not compromise what I learned the hard way for well, anything? I only really started to accept MDLB recently, so I still have a lot of growing to do. I also have certain goals (will talk about later). I have explored my feelings a lot, and I was surprised. Before I thought about MDLB but I was always pretty embarrassed. I guess for me, being so vulnerable with another person was very hard. I had a lot of issues with self-rejection and self-hatred. There were many years of me actively supressing my emotions, thoughts, personality. Putting on a fake personality, whatever. In a sense, I am still a mystery to myself. I have learned some things about myself through MDLB though, which is honestly SHOCKING?? In a way, MDLB has helped me to stop being so afraid of myself, and stop rejecting myself. I care a lot less about what society says now, lmfao. I guess since I stopped denying myself, and started accepting myself, I'm shocked by what I'm finding. Truth be told, I didn't expect myself to be the way I am! I would not say I'm a stereotypical little, right, but wow. I have a lot of stuffed animals from when I was a kid, and I have a small elephant stuffed animal. He's always been my favorite. I've noticed recently, that I can hold him and it's almost like woooow. It's so nice to give him a nice hug. To hold him, spend time with him. Cuddle with him. It's really comforting, and it makes me really happy on the inside. But I would have never done things that made me feel good on the inside before, cause I was too worried about what people would think. Sometimes my imagination goes wild and I imagine that he's a little living creature hugging me back xD, or I notice a presence there. I also realized, that I really like MLP -- but I didn't watch it for awhile because I was embarrassed. I have MLP running while I'm writing this and it's awesome. Talk about going deep into being little. You know what I love most about being little? The fact that you can just sit there or do whatever you're doing and basically have a completely empty mind, and everything is just okay. Among things, of course. I was embarrassed by some of the things relating to MDLB, or rather apprehensive about it -- and I didn't want to pursue MDLB because I didn't think I'd ever find a decent woman that was interested in MDLB. But, it's interesting how things work out. I've been exploring MDLB a lot lately and working on myself, opening myself up and accepting myself. I gave some things relating to MDLB a shot, which really embarrassed me, and I was really apprehensive about doing, but when I did it, they made me feel really really good and happy! And I realized something, when I started to go into all these things of MDLB. Yeah, some of it can be really embarrassing at first, or nerve wracking -- but it always feels good once you do it. It's like, if I can just make a metaphor or whatever, the little boy just needs to bow down and be little, cause little things are what he's meant to do. And he's kinda afraid of of doing little things, but when he does it, it's amazing for him. So, he's a lot less afraid now, because he knows it always feels good to do little boy things, even if it may be kinda weird at first (I'm talking about myself btw ofc). For example, I love obedience and submission. It makes me really happy to hear that I'm a good boy. SOOOOOO HAPPY. You know, I have this thing about myself. I spent so many years suppressing my emotions, when I feel something, sometimes I will hide that I feel it. But, if you tell me I am a good boy, even if I hide my reaction, I am melting. Because that's what I want to be, mommy's good boy. There is nothing more pleasing to me in life, than pleasing a loving mommy. It's nice to have your efforts recognized. Not only that, it's just nice to play your part in the relationship. The very nature of this is that the little boy submit to his mommy. That's because the little boy is supposed to be the little one -- and mommy is the one who knows best. So, little boy doesn't have to worry about right or wrong or what and what not to do. He gives control to his mommy, and does whatever. That's why I said earlier, it's one of my favorite things about being little. You can go so deep, that you let go of literally everything in life except being little and enjoying the moment -- you can be completely blank minded, let all of it go. And who does all this go towards? Mommy takes control. I personally enjoy that. I'd rather have mommy be in control, than me be in control. I think it's a blessing that mommy likes it when I'm little, because being little is fun. I get to let go and phase out, and mommy gets to do whatever she gets to do. Now, that's not saying that the relationship is all about me or my pleasure, of course. I honestly don't understand why someone would be drawn towards a mommy type role, because being a little is so awesome. But, I imagine that mommies must get the type of pleasure I get from being little. It's just who I am, and who I always have been. I rejected it for a long time because I was afraid of judgement, and because of society nonsense. But forget all that. I'm 21 now, ain't high school. Forget what people say about me. There's nothing better in life than being little for me, and I'm not ashamed to say it. So, I will not apologize to people, if they don't like the things that I do. Now, of course, there are some things about this type of relationship that I didn't understand until recently. Before, I couldn't imagine how people could ever want to wear diapers -- now I completely understand. I imagine that if I try diapers, I'll never go back. Maybe I'll train myself to be incontinent too, hmm? But, people don't understand this. That's because they lack the fundamental knowledge about subjects like diapers. First off, diapers is a nice experience to share with a caregiver, it can be a special thing. Secondly, it's like what I wrote above. Anything I've experienced relating to MDLB so far, maybe I've been embarrassed, or apprehensive, but once I did it, it made me feel really good. I'm guessing diapers are gonna have the same effect on me. I'm pretty sure it's just meant to be. I guess it's a step towards the little transformation, anyways. So like, the good part of MDLB relationships, is you are making a step to accept the other person you are in a relationship with -- there is no barriers, or shame, there is only acceptance and love. That's how it should be anyways. So, when a little goes back to childlike behaviors, which are sometimes embarrassing -- it also makes them feel really good. Looking from the outside in, you may not understand this and judge MDLD (that's what I did) -- But, there's a certain purity, in this type of lifestyle. MDLB is not sexual (in my opinion for the most part), it's the return of a little to a time of innocence and pureness, a release of all things. It's the letting go of all the big things, and trusting in the mommy to take care of all those things. In a way, MDLB can be like a drug. For me, I go into a state of like 100% unity and like total submission and just like oneness with my mommy. My mind is like pretty much completely blank, I let my mommy control my life for the most part, I don't care about being in charge -- all that I am, is mommy's little boy. It's like -- just giving your mommy all stresses and worries of life, and all things that worry you -- and receiving the comfort of her presence in place. You don't even have to think anymore, you know? You can go super deep into being a little. I mean, you can really let go of everything else and just lose yourself a bit. So, I just talked about diapers for example -- maybe you don't understand why people would want that either, maybe it sounds strange (and maybe it is) -- let me give you an example though. This example summarizes how many things work in MDLB relationships in my opinion. Say I was a little that wears diapers 24/7 -- right? Let's say I'd wet or mess myself, and then I'd go to my mommy, and I'd tell her all little I needed to be changed. In this moment, I am more than just roleplaying. In this situation, I am a little child, asking my caretaker to help me. More than that, I am giving her a chance to share in something special, an experience of trust and love and acceptance. Maybe I'd be embarrassed, and my mommy would tell me not to be. I'd submit to her, and she would clean me and put a new diaper on. And it would feel good, to share this interaction with her. Why? It's nice to have a relationship where there is no shame, where there is no guilt, where you do not hide things from each other. It's actually quite strange, because there are many ""weird"" things about MDLB relationships like this. But, it's frankly shocking. Once you get over that embarrassment, these ""weird"" experiences turn into something special. For a little, they feel REALLY good. SHOCKINGLY GOOD. First we are embarrassed, then we are comforted and loved, and we're almost like further encouraged by our mommies into our little behaviors, and then we submit and it feels really good. Like, heroin level good. Littles are like soft little sensitive things -- myself included. So for example, when we are obedient and submissive, our mommies will tell us we're good little boys, and that we make them proud, and they might give us hugs and kisses. For some people, experiencing something like that may be weird. For me, it was weird. But, once I looked past the weirdness and embarrassment of some parts of the MDLB interactions, and I tried some of the things -- I felt that doing these weird things made me feel really good on the inside. I had never had that type of love or acceptance before. I think there is just something particularly sacred about this type of relationship -- and the type of love that can happen between two people in a relationship like this. It's like, holy in my opinion. Also, I have to say, if you have dealt with childhood trauma, trauma in general in your life -- it really messes you up. For me, I've had a very hard life, and I barely survived. I was so embarassed and shy, and scared of rejection -- I would hide my true self. It's because I was hurt so much, that I started habits like that. But, something special happens with a MDLB relationship. It takes you to a place of absolute vulnerability -- and when you present this vulnerability before a loving mommy, she takes all your fears away and replaces them with love. And that love, that love heals all the damage of the past. So, I personally believe that these relationships are extremely therapeutic, just saying. From what I've seen from myself, exploring concepts of MDLB has enriched my life in ways I didn't even think possible. I think there is not a love more pure than the type of love experienced in a MDLB relationship. A regression to innocence, and an acceptance of that child-like innocence by the motherly figure. A chance to do it all over again, but better. Love is the best medicine, after all -- and there is literally no type of relationship more pure and loving than a MDLB relationship in my opinion. But, when you face these things which scare you and embarrass you, and then you trust in your mommy and do them anyways, your mommy shows you love and acceptance, and reassures you -- and that's like, so extremely beautiful. It makes you feel good on the inside, in a way you've never really felt good before. And yeah, it's pretty damn addictive. I could imagine myself completely losing myself to littleness -- losing awareness, losing maturity, just like transforming or going through a metamorphosis into a child-like being lmao (and that's actually my plan for the future -- should I not get tired of MDLB lol) So for me, coming to MDLB was simple. I was going through a rough time, and I had thought about MDLB before. I checked out some YouTube videos of like MDLB roleplay dialogue, and I saw the way that the mommy would talk to the little. For me, I pretty much rejected it instantly. I saw the pureness, and innocence of it. I saw how good it was, and I was afraid of it. When I started to listen to these videos and kind of follow along, there were parts of me that were resisting, because I was afraid to let myself get vulnerable to that level. For many years, I hid who I was because people had rejected me and tormented me in my childhood. Suppressed feelings, personality, emotion as I said. But, for some reason this time, I did things different. I decided to open up a little bit, and be vulnerable. I listened to one of these YouTube videos, of like MDLB talking. Basically like a woman recording some RP voice-clips. I imagined myself as the little, imagined her as the mommy. And, as she was talking, I was responding to her in my head. It was literally incredible. At first, I thought all the MDLB talk was really weird. Babying someone, whatever. But then, I realized the value of it, and it was so incredibly reassuring and comforting and amazing. Then I let it in, and those soft statements of the mommy reached to the hurt part of me, and helped the child be alive in me once again. It helped to bring me back to life in general. If you want some examples btw, here are a few videos of hers, her channel is great. [URL [URL [URL [URL Now, for someone like me, I have spent most of my life isolating myself and rejecting myself, being very ""independent"". I was this way because people had rejected me, as I said, and I thought I just had to deal with everything on my own, and it is what it is. But, giving that control away to a super loving and accepting mommy figure, was like amazing. At first, I thought the videos were a bit stupid, not going to lie. But then I really gave it a chance, and I got over the pain, and I realized it made me feel really good, and really happy. I realized it was exactly what I had always needed in my life. I tried to give MDLB a chance in the past, but, it never really worked out. Back then, I didn't push through the embarrassment like I did this time. I'm happy to say the majority of that is over now, though. All of it really. I don't know if you want to consider me damaged goods or not, but, I am healing and changing. I imagine there will be some leftover things to deal with. But, at least I am not in a state of massive confusion about myself. I know what needs to be done, going forward. I believe in naturalness. Naturalness is something I've written much philosophy about. It is similar in principle to ""wu-wei"" from the Dao De Jing -- just things as they are and should be, the natural flow and progression of events. So, I will never force things on, or put on a show, or fake things. If I have to force something, then it isn't natural. Rather, I show allow things to happen naturally so a genuine transformation can take place. For example, I'm not going to talk like a baby on purpose, when I have the ability to talk like an adult. I actually find that more strange than wearing diapers for some reason lol. My ultimate plan here, guys, is to completely embrace littleness. For me, MDLB has become a way of life. I am done, with hiding who I really am, and I am done with not doing things that I enjoy, because ppl are not approving. I know what I want and love now -- and these are the things I am going to spend my life doing. So, when I say completely embrace littleness, hm, I say to go through a genuine transformation of one's being. To let go of the other things -- to lose awareness of ""big things"" and ""big behaviors"" -- to become completely lost within being a little, to the point that I know no other way. Then, it is the only way -- and there is no other way -- and it's a total way of life, versus just something I slip into here and there. And, it is natural then. I would not try to act like an adult in public, because I would have lost the concept of me having been an adult. For me, I would be a little boy, with his mommy, and I don't know better. Hm. I wonder, if such a thing is possible -- to go so deep with this? I think so. Many things are possible within reality. I guess I would just have to take time to figure out if I really want to go all the way all the way, with my littleness. Perhaps a trial run is warranted. It sounds strange -- why would you want to transform your being into a kid, and forget the left over parts? Why would you want to lose yourself to littleness -- well, I have done my time of philosophy, and searching of deeper meaning. I have found the truth -- there's not much left for me to do. The things of this world do not really interest me so? I am not a normal human being. For me, it's almost like this was my calling in life -- MDLB. I have to say, I don't know if it's possible to spend your life as a little -- (honestly if I went for disability I could probably get it, so maybe it is possible for me tho) -- alllllll that being said though, this is very presumptive speech. Who knows, maybe I will get tired of being little one day? As unlikely as it sounds. Anyways, I have already made some of the steps, but some things will take some time. For example, talking simpler, allowing my head to be empty more, becoming more dependent and reliant on mommy, just naturally walking towards childish behaviors. No more focus on ""big"" things -- but, going through life with a certain little perspective. Not getting hung up on complications. Just empty head and submission. I can't really explain how the path is going to look like -- but I know that it's possible, so hey, that's what I've decided I want to do with my life -- cause I haven't cared about much in life, but, MDLB makes me feel really good. So, I will go for what does me good in life. I'd like to say though, that if you combine spirituality with MDLB -- you can probably go pretty damn deep. I am aware, of some hidden possibilities in this world -- I know that it is like 95% possible to literally transform myself into a little permanently (if I willed it strong enough), because I have already reached a temporary state like that -- yes, I have reached a state in which there was no adult me, it was just me in that moment -- me being the real me, and me focusing on ""mommy"". So anyways, hey, there are a lot of potentials in life. I have always believed in the importance of connecting with someone really deep -- and I think it's possible that two people can come together and literally be as one. Yes, One. I don't know if it's possible, but it has been claimed to be possible. So in a way, I hold out for it. In my mind, it's a beautiful thought. That two people might feel each other directly -- feel feelings, know each other's thoughts -- that two might meld together on the deepest levels, and move and act in unison. Blah blah blah, right? I'm just saying, there are some deeper possibilities in life, and I might want to explore that. What I am saying, the MDLB relationship allows for very deep possibilities -- combine that with spirituality, you have possibilities that are beyond the limits of explanation. So yeah, I am looking for something special, and hopefully life long. But, who knows? All things in life are temporary. Who knows, if it's meant for me to live a life like this? Time will tell, yes? Very well could be this is just like a honeymoon period I'm having with the idea of MDLB. Then again though, it's never been like this with anything. I'm still having troubles, trying to figure if it's right for me -- been through a lot of nonsense in the past. I guess time will tell? \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Guys, I am really tired. I hyperfocused and wrote everything above in like one go, took multiple hours. So, I'm not going to spend a huge amount of time on this section. I guess this is going to be just random details about myself? I live in USA, VA -- btw. Okay, so some hobbies? I don't even know, so I'll just randomly list some. I like to for walks a lot, in the park, around the neighborhood -- I go with my dog, and I go barefoot a lot. I enjoy going barefoot, it's pretty natural and good feeling. I'm pretty much just a nature person in general. I love all animals, I appreciate the beauty of creation. I have a guinea pig, and a dog. And it's actually funny too because I guess I am really sweet person? I respect all living creatures -- insects, plants, animals, humans, whatever else. I just sort of have this compassion about everything that is? Let's see -- I write a TON, I write about all kinds of stuff, and write for various reasons. Contemplation of subjects, philosophy, regular writing, diary, whatever. I just write a lot. I also like TV, YouTube, not so much games anymore. I've been enjoying kids shows lately, just been watching MLP recently. Oh, I guess I really enjoy my stuffed animals too. And, you really really got to check this out. I remember when I was like in middle school or so I always loved the Warrior Cats books. They've got on YouTube the audiobooks of pretty much all the books. It's awesome. Anything else? Hmm. Not really, I've been kind of boring recently? I have been looking for the right relationship for some time now, but I am a bit nervous. I kind of have a feeling this is exactly it, you know? But what do you ever know about anything? Maybe in the past I have rushed things a bit, probably my bad. I guess I am just one human being, among the many? And by the way, this section above? I don't even know wtf happened there. You know sometimes you just start writing about something and going on and on for no apparent reason? Idk if what I wrote at all really contributed much. The hobbies and details in this section are not really so spectacular either? The only way to see if you work with someone in my opinion is to talk with them, and feel how the energy goes? Oh yeah, anyone, feel free to HMU, PM, direct chat, whatever. Cheers! Okay, P.S -- My mind is like really advanced and like complicated in the thinking mannerisms, I think about a lot of deep stuff. But, I'm basically a kid on the inside. Especially my emotions, lol. But my mind is like just different. I have a tendency to obsess and perfection seek when it comes to knowledge, so I guess I've kinda over-sharpened my mind over the years. Unneeded complexity? You can see this in my writing habits -- something I am trying to work on now is simplicity, and having a clear and little mind. I don't know if these habits are actually beneficial or if they have resulted in anything (the habits of complexity, obsession) -- I don't think so. So, unneeded complexity. I like to think of myself as an intellectual, but these notions I have in my head are probably false notions anyways. But, don't be fooled by me. You should treat me as a little, because I really am one. I don't even need to try to be, I just am. I guess in my search for a partner, I am hoping to meet someone who will help me on this path of transformation as well. It will be easier with two of us. Whatever else? Idk. Just chat me with questions if you have any. And also, sometimes I just assume things? I imagine things, and like, mix up the possibilities of what is possible in reality, with what is made in my imagination? I assume just because I imagine it, it can be so here? I guess I need someone to ground me to reality in a way too, or come into my little fantasy land and just help out? Lmao. See ya!"

There is little room to openly express how you feel as men. I like to compare it akin to WWII when letters were exchanged, soldiers often needing someone to feel less lonely. Now in the modern age, messages can be sent at a near instant but at a cost of convenience, when it seemed easy for a correspondence to trickle down in a few hours. I'm not looking for that. Something that is mutual and long-term, create some fond memories even along the way. Vulnerability can be a heavy risk, especially for men in the military... for those who'd been a platoon leader, or in charge of a garrison, the safety of your men in your unit matters. Even then, any flinching to vulnerability can greatly matter in your men's confidence in you, their faith, respect. Losing that in your command can be everything. It is tempting to be in the mindset of being a razor (kudos if you get the reference) ... to casting aside fear, or hesitation when danger is near, forcing you to change who you are as human. The choice does not have to be so. For professions that require professionalism and taught discipline... you rarely get to speak your thoughts off the record. Maybe that's where my hidden allure lies? Or it can just be feeling tired and restless at everything, whether to take off your police vest that smells like Nachos when you get home from a long shift or dreading the next Chinese field day in your barracks... I won't tell you endless platitudes and recycled apathetic self-help advice to tell you to keep on trudging, or thanking you for your service like so many people. If anything I dislike, it's three things: bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. A deep-rooted friendship I'm hoping we can form, save for some light-hearted flirtation. I'm open to pursuing a long-term romantic relationship though I know it'll be as hard as men finding someone who isn't a Jody/Becky solely looking for their BAH/Tricare benefits that confers +1000 looks in a man... and then having them take what's left of your affordable E-4 pay. The chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and again I'd very much like someone to frequently talk to long-term. Most people are either feeling starved during this time because of social isolation but there are some out there whom sentiment is no different even before COVID-19 hit. I am one of those people. Sometimes, I'd think about a hypothetical scenario in which if I go MIA and drop off the radar, I most likely wouldn't be noticed... until several weeks or months later (save for my parents but that's a rather complicated story). So, I'm taking my choice, and the shotgun approach to meet the people I wish to meet, of my own choosing and control... hoping to find some good company. **About me:** 6'1'', 100 kg, Asian-Australian, brown-haired with glasses, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital), closeted Mtf trans whose sole comfort as of this time in her identity is cross-dressing and giving myself a female name as I live at home with parents... so loneliness can sometimes be an understatement. **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Music: Outlaw country/country rock/classic rock/southern rock/Motown/Philadelphia sound/R&amp;B/Blue-eyed soul/a bit of Irish-Gaelic * TV shows: Battlestar Galactica, LOST, COPS (especially S1), 12 Monkeys, Person of Interest, West Wing, The Newsroom **You:** * As a preference, you are non-married or partnered (don't want to create that unneeded drama) * 18-53 * Not starting your first message as a simple ""Hey"" or ""Hey there"" but the more you describe yourself about you, the better.

I will start messaging back tomorrow morning (4/17). Hey. I like your brain. Tell me about your thoughts and your emotions. I don't have many hobbies or interests. I can't give you a list of music or movies that I think somehow define myself or my identity. People interest me. I like knowing how a person thinks, how a person feels, and why it is that a person thinks and feels the way he or she does. If you think you are wothless, if you think you are the greatest person to have ever existed, or if you are somewhere between those two extremes, you're interesting to me. You have your own story, and I would love to hear it. I have struggled with my fair share of mental health problems. I welcome anyone who struggles with mental health issues, substance addiction, and/or behavioral addiction to reach out to me. I welcome those who have a loved one who struggles with any of these issues. I also welcome those who do not struggle with any of these issues. What I can offer you is this: You talk and I listen. You hurt and I support you. You want and I encourage you. You feel unloved so I love you. That sot of dynamic. I don't judge. I don't condemn. I don't offer unsolicited advice or lectures. What you can offer me is this: You share the contents of that lovely brain of yours. You distract me from my own reality for a little while. There isn't much to say about me, because I tend to chosose not to. But of course, you're welcome to probe my fear of vulnerability. You're also welcome to just use me for validation, support, or whatever it is that you were seeking from having clicked on this post. I'm not a therapist. If you happen to be in the NY/PA/NJ/VA/WV area, let's go backpacking some time. So, as a conversation starter, why did you choose to respond to this post?"

I dont feel half as brave or as sure about myself, but Ive already been naked on the internet so I figure it cant hurt to try. Ive been lucky to make really wonderful, meaningful connections with redditors. Whether it was a good conversation over coffee, an incredibly hot night in a hotel, or building a deeper emotional and sexual connection over time, each one taught me valuable lessons. Ive learned a lot about myself and I think I have a better sense of what Im looking for. Im looking for a relationship with someone consistent, compassionate, and emotionally intelligent, and with whom Im sexually compatible. Im still exploring kink and sexuality, and Id like to find a partner who will join me on that journey. But ideally our connection isnt limited to sex; we can talk about the miraculous mundanity of our lives, enjoy each others company, and grow together. Its a strange and lonely and uncertain time right now. I know from all the posts here lately that Im not alone in that desire for meaningful connection, even if it cant be in-person right now. But I hope we can pass the days talking in the meantime and look forward to meeting the next time we can. Im 29F, 58, and slim. My favorite place in the city is the New York Botanical Garden. Im reading a lot more non-fiction and poetry these days, watching less tv, and replacing it with Animal Crossing instead. I love pop songs, summer thunderstorms, live music, and a good slice of cake. I love to travel and in every city I visit I take pictures of the sky, spend an afternoon at an art museum, and go on a boat tour when I can. I love good food and have been cooking a lot more in the last month, and have gotten quite good at making pancakes. I like talking about how it feels to love a movie or a book or a sports team or a song, and why we love those things. We dont need to have the same taste, but a shared sensibility and appreciation of art and media and food is important to me. Sexually, I love giving/receiving oral, butt plugs and toys, and have a bit of an exhibitionist side. I like cum play and public play. Im very interested in exploring group sex, restraints/bondage, among other things. There will be days Id rather you tell me how I should touch my pussy for you; that doesnt make me your fucktoy. I will always want to hear about your day, what you did and saw. Did you have something good for lunch? I want to know how youre feeling and whats on your mind in the hope we can create a safe space to express ourselves and what we need. Im generally attracted to dudes around my age or older (26 to 40-ish) who are taller than I am and give great hugs and cuddles. Kindness, patience, emotional maturity, and good communication are just as important as physical attraction and chemistry. Experience with BDSM is a plus, but not necessary. Just be open to each others fantasies and experimenting, be clear and respectful of boundaries. Please be single, local to the NYC area, and want to be in a relationship. I hope you can be patient with me because it takes me a bit to warm up to someone. I enjoy getting to know people and talking on the phone, but I also need my space sometimes. I can get overwhelmed and need a day or two to recalibrate. I dont have notifications turned on for any of the apps on my phone, so Im not the quickest to reply. If you need someone to reply right away all the time, Im not the gal for you. While I am ultimately looking for something serious, I want to take our time getting to know each other. The most important thing is being open to the potential for more. Ive posted before looking for a fwb and that kind of relationship has its place, but it also has its limitations. Im not asking for big romantic gestures; but I do want mutual trust and care and affection. I want fun, joyful sex(ting) without sacrificing love and vulnerability. I want to know that everyday we are choosing each other. I know this is a big ask, but if something here resonates with you, reach out and tell me a little about yourself. Please include a SFW picture in your message and the title of your favorite movie from your childhood in the subject."
120,vulnerability,r4r,23 [M4F] Austin TX - Hoping to discuss things,1,g7klew,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/g7klew/23_m4f_austin_tx_hoping_to_discuss_things/,2020-04-25 11:05:32,"I am looking for someone to talk to. Living alone during this time is a lot to handle... I work from home and generally enjoy my work. I regularly worked out (until the gyms closed) and now the minimal weights at home are not quite enough to get me excited to continue... I have been a PC gamer for much of my life (over half). It is what got me into programming and interested in computers. However, a lot of my friends who play games have become fairly negative influences on my life. I do not know where to go now that my usual way of unwinding has gone away. I have a growth mindset. I know that with time, effort, and a little luck, I can accomplish anything. As I said before, I enjoy the work I do. I wish there were more time in the day to healthily do all that I want, but alas that is not possible. Even during this time of stay-at-home orders and quarantine, it is not possible to do everything you want or need to do without a lot of effort. I have opinions and thoughts that I want to share and discuss, but most of my friends are at a time and place in their lives where all they can think about is how to pay the bills or where to buy an eighth, or which game to play or why that TV show sucks. I am beyond that. I want to break free of the mold that has held me in place (socially) for so long. It is hard to go and do things on your own, with no one there beside you. My past relationships have been less than healthy, and I seek someone who genuinely wants to discuss and be open about opinions, creative pursuits, and growing together. I want to explore the world free of judgement. I am not without flaw. I realize that nobody is. I try to live in the moment but it is tough some times to continue on the path you're on with no guidance and no reassurance that what you are doing is right. It feels lonely, and I feel isolated. I find myself planning vacation soon (when it is safe to do so mind you) with no one to enjoy it with. I think of my friends and think, ""gee, I know they won't want to participate"" because they are stuck in their rut. I think, ""that would be a great vacation to take with a partner,"" as I realize that I don't have one. It's this feeling of loneliness and isolation that I dread. Count the ""I""s in this post and it may explain why these things are true; it is probably not the best to continuously think of one's self. This truly extraordinary time (a phrase I have heard a lot of lately) is one wherein I believe it is acceptable and even desirable to be one's true self; exposing yourself and your vulnerabilities to others like never before. Unfortunately, not many agree. Vulnerability and openness is not something that comes easily to most-- especially men. I think that there are social stigmas around that, some warranted and some not. I just want someone to talk to. I have always made friends with women easier than with men. I think that finding friends in men is one thing, but a life partner (for me anyway) and someone with whom I want to spend a lot of time with, well women are far superior in my view... There is obviously a lot that goes with that. But I just want someone who I can share hopes and dreams with. Someone that understands that I am not into many of ""the memes"" as the kids say (I am 23 so I can call people kids now). Ultimately, I want someone who understands that effort is required by both parties, not just one. Unfortunately I think the level of signal-to-noise in this sort of a space is fairly low, and I feel as though I am likely pouring a cup of water into the ocean. That said, I do not expect a response, but if I receive one, all the better. This sort of a medium is different than that of Tinder. I feel shallow swiping through Tinder, despite my best effort not to be... and unfortunately I feel that is the motive behind the app and the ultimate result for both the women and men using that. Again, doubtful I will hear from anyone but if somehow I sparked interest in someone, please do feel free to PM me. I am drinking a couple beers and look forward to speaking to you. &amp;#x200B; Thanks a lot and happy Friday."

I'll guess I keep trying until I have something worth of a reply. I'm not sure what exactly warrants a lot of upvotes for an r4r post, apart from creativity.... but what I can make up for is unvarnished honesty and a rather active desire in something unorthodox to pursue something that is my choice.... something that I want. I'm looking for some male guys to build and nurture such friendships. My current ones seem to be on the verge of dying out, becoming more distant or just weren't right for me (and whom one asshole of a ""friend"" told me I was a miserable and I fortunately blocked in response...go to hell Roberto). Considering that my journey of transitioning is me taking the first few, slow baby steps right now (since I live with unaccepting parents atm), I'm feeling more lonely in my search for people who I feel don't really understand me, mostly never making that choice. Most people I met in passing. Friendships... what do they mean to me? Everyone has their own definition but I'm not like everyone.... or else I'd be a talking parrot. Where we share our vulnerabilities, our needs and desires are unashamed. One where I could trust you and hopefully vice versa A deep-rooted friendship at the core of it, is what I'm hoping we can form, save for some light hearted flirtation. Maybe more if we really get along and you've earned my trust in you to let it be so. My chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and I'd very much like someone to frequently talk to long-term, someone who I'd feel I can get on their level and for them to get on mine. Any one interested, feel free to PM. I do have a certain preference for US LEOs/military men though (Army, Navy, Marines, AF, Coast Guard... darn right I included the coast guard) as my interests are more orientated towards law enforcement/military somewhat though open to others who are not. I guess there's a trade-off when it comes to having so many niche interests. ***For men in the military reading this:*** Still a skeptic and think there's more to that? Well, no need to worry about your BAH/Tricare or me sniffing that modest E4 pay, we've got universal healthcare where I'm from, the land of little out-of-pocket costs, no outrageous premiums! Nothing significant to gain anyways ;) Besides, does having a healthcare system with that much benefits stop me from feeling unfulfilled and lonely in life? No lol. You can wave the benefits in front of my face and doesn't change my interest in you (if you are in one or had been both in these fields). On one condition.... you aren't or weren't an MP... just kidding... or am I? ;) In all seriousness, I understand an important consequence of men being in the position of law enforcement and/or in the military...when it comes to vulnerability. Vulnerability can be a heavy risk, especially in the military... for those who'd been a platoon leader, or in charge of a garrison, the safety of your men in your unit matters. Even then, any flinching to vulnerability can greatly matter in your men's confidence in you, their faith, respect. Losing that in your command can be everything. It is tempting to be in the mindset of being a razor... to casting aside fear, or hesitation when danger is near, forcing you have to change who you are as human. The choice does not have to be so. For professions that require professionalism and taught discipline... you rarely get to speak your thoughts off the record. Or it can just be feeling tired and restless at everything if you're a LEO, whether to take off your vest that smells like Nachos when you get home from a long shift or dreading the next Chinese field day in your barracks. Your bar buddies aren't hard-pressed for conversations, sometimes you find yourself yearning for someone to make your day less stressed, incrementally brighter can make a difference. Regardless, I'd like to give you that chance of being vulnerable...and you can let me know if that's something you like. **About me:** 6'1'', 100 kg, Asian-Australian, black-haired with glasses, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital). **Dislikes:** bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Captivated by crime scenes (check Loudlabs news and Loudlabs news nyc in yt) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Aviation, aviation flight trip reports * Anything US military related.

(yes i am speaking from experience) I feel like.. people's values and the way they interact with others and the world around them dictates who they are and who gets along with who, much moreso than a list of what Star Wars movies you stan. like for a hookup? of course, list the kinks and set the damn date. but for a real connection? not so simple. like do i like to talk about vapid shit every so often? yes of course. there's no big talk without the small talk filler. do i believe that every silence needs to be filled? nope, the opposite actually. we need more meaningful silence and less meaningless words. looking for people who want to vent, who want to talk about the last time they truly felt alive, people who want to call me at 3am to tell me they made perfect carbonara for the first time. sick of wallowing in loneliness and want to reach out before i get way too jaded about life and love and relationships. side note im mega zooted and definitely will be passing out soon. we are a slave to our biology and all that jazz. i am free as heck tomorrow and will be able to reply to anyone that sends a legit message that isn't ""hey"" or ""hi"" or some lazy variation thereupon. open to any kind of relationship with anybody. sorry that's vauge but I would rather not artificially limit my chances with anyone. but i am fussy. not about looks, but about character. so buyer beware lmao goodnight r4r"

127,vulnerability,r4r,29 [F4R] IL/Midwest- I just...want to feel excited to talk to someone again,1,g9bkxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/g9bkxo/29_f4r_ilmidwest_i_justwant_to_feel_excited_to/,2020-04-28 09:04:24," The first thing you need to know about me is that I love words. I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."

I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, I am probably not the most flattering (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mind. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

I'll guess I keep trying until I have something worth of a reply. It doesn't help that people my age and generation are ones I feel I'm lacking in connection. Maybe it's because of my niche interests, or me pursuing my rather specific wants. At least the perks of posting is you being the judge and being able to filter who you feel you could be compatible with. Unfortunately, I'm one of the souls not into anime, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, watching Netflix, greatly enthused about memes, ""looking for a deep convo"" etc. that I find often in many posts... especially for a Gen Z'er born a year before Y2K. It's hard to form a connection with people whom I feel to be myself out-of-touch from the trends. Friendships... what do they mean to me? Everyone has their own definition but I'm not like everyone.... or else I'd be a talking parrot. Where we share our vulnerabilities, our needs and desires are unashamed. One where I could trust you and hopefully vice versa. Unvarnished honesty is what I want. A deep-rooted friendship at the core of it, and if we get along swimmingly, I am open to it being more. Every day, I feel no one has taken the initiative or willingness to understand me, I don't have anyone in my life to have a best friend long-term, and my very few friends are growing distant, even had the unfortunate obnoxious and obtuse ass of a friend I've blocked. I don't even have a long-term male best friend that I made in university currently! And I'm due to finish by the end of next year in my Bach. of Nursing!! I want to feel angry at the world and give the middle finger, right now, I'm completely apathetic to what's happening, for the loss of the things people experience right now, my life was equally miserable before. Having to grieve or lose a life I could've had in the past, being repressed, when many things didn't pan out right. Reaching to the point, where I'd feel like I want to run away and live somewhere very rural. I'm giving a chance though if there is anyone out there that I could connect with. The chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and I'd very much like someone to frequently talk and correspond to long-term. I'm not looking for any therapists nor am I seeking anyone looking to offer me platitudes that I've grown numb to. You're not the first person to ever tell me what it is you're thinking. I'm looking for specific people, in environments and career that are able to get on my level, and for me to get on theirs. Any one interested, feel free to PM. **About me:** Asian-Australian, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital). **Dislikes:** bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Captivated by crime scenes (check Loudlabs news and Loudlabs news nyc in yt) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Aviation, aviation flight trip reports * Anything US military related. Equipment, gear, guns, lingo... I probably wouldn't know half of it but I'll quietly nod yes as your drone out anything in detail. * Military MREs food reviews * Reading. Currently aiming to read ""Towards a New Maritime Strategy: American Naval Thinking in the Post Cold-War Era"". Other books that I have read include: Shortest Way Home by Pete Buttigieg, Winter of the World/Edge of Eternity book series by Ken Follett, The Strain, Wayward Pines book series, World War Z by Max Brooks * Music: Outlaw country/country rock/classic rock/southern rock/Motown/Philadelphia sound/R&amp;B/Blue-eyed soul/a bit of Irish-Gaelic (a big favorite is Bear McCreary - Wander My Friends and some other songs from the same artist: Kat's Sacrifice, Pegasus, Prelude to War) * TV shows: Battlestar Galactica, LOST, COPS (especially S1), 12 Monkeys, Person of Interest, West Wing, The Newsroom * Other interesting random tidbits about me: Choice of gun is a Glock 33 .357SIG, favorite instruments are piano and Uilleann pipes **You:** * Non-married or partnered * Open-minded, kind, very understanding * 18-53 (preference for 30+) * Not starting your first message as a simple ""Hey"" or ""Hey there"" but the more you describe yourself about you, the more likely I'll give you a chance. Take your time if you want to answer in-depth. ***Disclaimer:*** I do have a certain preference for **US LEOs/military men** ***(Army, Navy, Marines, AF, Coast Guard... darn right I included the coast guard)*** as my interests are more orientated towards law enforcement/military somewhat though open to others who are not. Yes, If you find that gives you an expression of silent disapproval that I'm being too selective, I suggest you hightail that disapproval elsewhere. On the more humorous end, I live in a country with non-outrageous premiums, out-of-pocket costs and a dream medicare-for-all system and I'm still very lonely! I doubt me mooching off your BAH/Tricare or that E-4 pay will get me anywhere ***(kudos if you get that godawful joke).*** In all seriousness, I know how lack of vulnerability in a hyper masculine environment such as policing or being in the military can be exhausting. Whether coming home from a exhausting shift and taking your police vest that smells like Nachos, or dreading the eventual Chinese field day in the barracks...from Rota to Bagram or from Pendleton to Lejeune, maybe the desire for some semblance of normalcy is something you're seeking, being away from home. Perhaps this is just my inner nurse speaking.... or it's some random mumbo-jumbo."
130,vulnerability,r4r,"33 [M4F] Canada/Online, I want your vulnerability. I want to give you mine. Thinking of you.",1,gajpi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gajpi2/33_m4f_canadaonline_i_want_your_vulnerability_i/,2020-04-30 08:52:06,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey there, my name is Jordan, 33/M/Alberta Canada, looking for a lovely lady (CIS / MtF: ). I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time. **[UPDATE]** Thank you for all the individuals who have reached out to me to provide support in my pursuit of happiness. It really means a lot. Thank you wholly. I will continue to voyage to find her. She's out there somewhere. She might be reading this right now. This is a repost. ^ ^"

I'll guess I keep trying until I have something worth of a reply. It doesn't help that people my age and generation are ones I feel I'm lacking in connection. Maybe it's because of my niche interests, or me pursuing my rather specific wants. At least the perks of posting is you being the judge and being able to filter who you feel you could be warm with to share correspondence with. So I am looking for any old souls out there, preferably older people to make friends with. Unfortunately, I'm one of the souls not into anime, Pokemon, Animal Crossing, watching Netflix, greatly enthused about memes, ""looking for a deep convo"" etc. that I find often in many posts... especially for a Gen Z'er born a year before Y2K. Friendships... what do they mean to me? Everyone has their own definition but I'm not like everyone.... or else I'd be a talking parrot. Where we share our vulnerabilities, our needs and desires are unashamed. One where I could trust you and hopefully vice versa. Unvarnished honesty is what I want. A deep-rooted friendship at the core of it. Every day, I feel no one has taken the initiative or willingness to understand me, I don't have anyone in my life to have a best friend long-term, and my very few friends are growing distant, even had the unfortunate obnoxious and obtuse ass of a friend I've blocked (go to hell Roberto). I don't even have a long-term male best friend that I made in university! I want to feel angry at the world and give the middle finger, right now, I'm completely apathetic to what's happening, for the loss of the things people experience right now, my life was equally miserable before. Having to grieve or lose a life I could've had in the past, being repressed, when many things didn't pan out right. Reaching to the point, where I'd feel like I want to run away and live somewhere very rural. I'm giving a chance though if there is anyone out there that I could connect with. The chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and I'd very much like someone to frequently talk and correspond to long-term. I'm not looking for any therapists nor am I seeking anyone looking to offer me platitudes that I've grown numb to. You're not the first person to ever tell me what it is you're thinking. I'm looking for specific people, in environments and career that are able to get on my level, and for me to get on theirs. Any one interested, feel free to PM. **About me:** Asian-Australian, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital). **Dislikes:** bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Watching raw footage of crime scenes, traffic accidents and/or police incidents (check Loudlabs news and Loudlabs news nyc in yt) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Aviation, aviation flight trip reports * Anything US military related. Equipment, gear, guns, lingo... I probably wouldn't know half of it but I'll quietly nod yes as your drone out anything in detail. * Military MREs food reviews * Reading. Currently aiming to read ""Towards a New Maritime Strategy: American Naval Thinking in the Post Cold-War Era"". Other books that I have read include: Shortest Way Home by Pete Buttigieg, Winter of the World/Edge of Eternity book series by Ken Follett, The Strain, Wayward Pines book series, World War Z by Max Brooks * Music: Outlaw country/country rock/classic rock/southern rock/Motown/Philadelphia sound/R&amp;B/Blue-eyed soul/a bit of Irish-Gaelic (a big favorite is Bear McCreary - Wander My Friends and some other songs from the same artist: Kat's Sacrifice, Pegasus, Prelude to War) * TV shows: Battlestar Galactica, LOST, COPS (especially S1), 12 Monkeys, Person of Interest, West Wing, The Newsroom * Other interesting random tidbits about me: Choice of gun is a Glock 33 .357SIG, favorite instruments are piano and Uilleann pipes **You:** * Non-married or partnered * Open-minded, kind, very understanding * 18-53 (preference for 30+) * Not starting your first message as a simple ""Hey"" or ""Hey there"" but the more you describe yourself about you, the more likely I'll give you a chance. If you give me something brief, I'll be less enthused about it and I'll probably give you a pass.

133,vulnerability,r4r,29 [F4R] US/Midwest- I just want to feel some butterflies i guess?,1,gbpw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gbpw0s/29_f4r_usmidwest_i_just_want_to_feel_some/,2020-05-02 06:38:11," The first thing you need to know about me is that I love words. I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."
134,vulnerability,r4r,27 [M4F] Toronto - Trying to find someone is like looking for that one sock your dryer ate,1,gcpzk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/gcpzk1/27_m4f_toronto_trying_to_find_someone_is_like/,2020-05-03 22:44:06,"Maybe you recently got some fun socks like a coffee themed pair that says *""Pot Head""* with a smiling coffee pot. Or maybe something more in vogue like Joe Exotic socks with a quote of *""Carole Baskin totally killed her husband""* on the bottom. And then you *lose* one to your dryer. How terrible. You have mismatched socks and your life will never be as complete as it once was. If that's anything like trying to find someone with mutual interests, then I get it. For more useless (or uselessly useful if you're like me) thought experiments, please see below: * Is Harrison Ford more iconic as Han Solo, or Indiana Jones? * Why do people always say, *""I'm well, thanks""* in response to someone asking them how they are? It'd be nice to hear the truth once in a while, like, *""Well, my cat disowned me and I'm two months late on my rent, so I'm not doing so well, Karen. But, thanks.""* * If someone had a brain transplant, are they the same person? (Ship of Theseus parable ) &amp;nbsp; Outside of that, I like trying anything at least once (I know at least one person reading this immediately thought of butt stuff...pls take me out first at least) and will learn about/research something just for the hell of it. So, I'm also looking for someone sharing that kind of mindset. Whew, ok. That's all I really got for now. I have quite a few interests such as reading anything from non-fiction to fantasy manga, immersive detective shows like The Killing or sci-fi like The Expanse, writing reviews for music and other forms of media just for fun. I would go on, but I won't bore you with an exhaustive list at the moment. I'm looking for anything from being really good friends to a serious relationship (with a preference for the latter, obviously, otherwise why would I be here hahahah....\#singleAF). If you've read this far, I'm disappointed; you could have used that time far more productively (e.g. looking up cat gifs). Nonetheless, send me your favourite conspiracy theory because what better sign of intimacy and vulnerability is there than admitting that the government is hiding aliens from us?

Im searching for a playmate that, provided there is some chemistry, would be open to a committed relationship. As of late Ive been a bit disappointed in the ads and messages Ive gotten, so I figured Id try something else to, hopefully, get some different results. &amp;nbsp; ##### A little bit about myself I am a 23 year old sub with masochistic tendencies paired with light brattiness. Id describe my build as petite, with shoulder length brown hair, being a bit taller than most, with a height of 185cm. Emotionally Im very sensitive and because of that I look for emotional literacy in my partners. I consider myself nerdy, ranging from anime and gaming, all the way up to a good book and a solid discussion. I can be just as content going out for a date, as I am spending a day cuddling on the couch. Other than that curiosity is a big motivation in my life, I have a lot of interests and I like exploring those to their fullest extent. This has resulted in a very experimentalist mindset throughout my life. &amp;nbsp; The biggest pull in BDSM for me is the expectation, rather than the exception, of clear, thorough and honest communication. I consider these essential for any healthy bonding, but especially so for a relationship, not to mention one where kink plays an important role. &amp;nbsp; ##### What Im looking for in a partner A man that is both honest and dominant enough to allow himself to be emotionally vulnerable. Someone to cuddle with on the couch, together with a show and perhaps some rope. A Dom that is more on the sensitive and caring side, but also holds a slight sadistic edge with the ability to enjoy things like degradation and (f/p)unishment. Though not required, ideally someone with a love for rope, but at the very least a willingness to learn and explore (Still learning self-bondage myself). Someone that enjoys cuddling and preferably enjoys lifting people over their shoulder or playfully pinning them down to prevent them from getting up. Someone in the age group from 25 up to and including 29, open to a committed monogamous relationship, living in the western or central parts of the country. Some fluff is fine, but a reasonably healthy weight is a requirement if I am to find someone attractive. I wont deny that I also favour men that are around my height range or taller. &amp;nbsp; And above all, someone that values trust, communication and emotional vulnerability just as much as I do. In the case that this post piques your interest and you think we'd be a match, Id love hearing from you. &amp;nbsp; Id appreciate people communicating via PM instead of Reddit chat."

I'm a shy-bean, kinda nerdy, farm girl. Here's some interesting facts about me: I can cuss a drunken sailor out of the room, boss 1,000+lb animals around, and I have a pretty tragic origin story. More on that later. **About me:** I'm the kind of woman that seeks solutions instead of complaining, and I almost always know what I want. My life goal is to piss off to the middle of no where and foster/adopt animals while writing luxuriously gruesome and heart-wrenching novels about death, love, and the resilient human condition. I've been told I have a savage, witty sense of humor, but I can be light and silly too. I have two cats, a dog, a horse, and probably depression. **Personality**: Imagine a mix of Toph Beifong (Avatar: Last Airbender), Diane Nguyen (Bojack Horseman), and Alyssa Foley (The End of The F\*\*\*ing World). Basically admitting all my mental issues with those three. Hoping by my 30s-40s I'll be a mix of Toph Beifong and Princess Carolyn. Maybe Sadie Adler from Red Dead 2. **What I'm here for:** A friendship where we take a genuine interest in each other's lives. I totally get that you have other shit to do, but ideally we can talk every 1-3 days. Preferably you're around my age, 19-28 yrs old. I value honesty, vulnerability, and a messed up sense of humor. Talk to me about anything. Ask me random questions. Send dank memes. I'll message you funny shit I find around the internet, and an obscene amount of pet pics. Hope you'll do the same. **Interests - Please have a few in common:** **Animal health/Tips/Training/Care** \- *I'm the crazy pet mom everyone warns you about, but I embrace it, lmao. If you have pets, I'd love to see and learn about them!* **Writing** \- *This is my chosen career that I pursue on the side of everything else.* **Movies/Musicals/T.V Shows** \- *(I'm very picky about what I watch, but here's the stuff I love)* *Joker (2019), Her (2013), The End of The F\*\*ing World, Hamilton (Musical), Heathers (Musical), I'm Not Okay With This, Bojack Horseman, Black Mirror, Avatar: The Last Airbender and YOU (T.V Show).* **Gardening** \- *I love succulents, herbs, and flowers! :D* **Music** \- *Teddy Hyde, Of Monsters And Men, Panic! At The Disco, Cage The Elephant, Chopin, Alesana, Jack Stauber, Cosmo Sheldrake, Jaymes Young, The Rolling Stones, Billie Eilish, Debussy, Mother Mother, and many, many more - recommend me songs!* **The Human Condition** \- *Philosophy, psychology, religion, even conspiracy theories...these are all topics that I enjoy learning about and speaking of (respectfully, of course). I am enthralled by the human mind, how it works, what it wants, and why the hell mine seems anxious all the damn time.* There's a bit about me. Bonus points if you send me a pic of your pets lmao. Or a song that you deeply relate to. Or a meme that describes your personality. Just try to give me more than a ""hey"" or some one-sentence bullshit to interact with, please. Hope to hear from you!"

I want a man who is respectful, mature and holds traditional values. I want a man who will be my rock and provide for me and the family we have together. I want to finally meet my soulmate. I am a sweet, sensitive, shy and warm-hearted woman. I am not judge mental or harsh. I am a homebody and i love to burrow in and just relax, but i also love nature and enjoy hiking, swimming, skiing, and boating. In my free time i like to read, learn about outer space, write in my journal, write letters, dance, teach myself guitar, go to the park, snuggle up with my cat and listen to music. I am simple but also a deep feeler and thinker. Im a very spiritual person and having faith and trust in God is important to me. I value love, growth, intimacy, compassion, friendship, passion, romance, family, honesty, communication, vulnerability, and tradition. My ideal partner would be similar to me in the sense that he is a sensitive, loving and affectionate man. Like the title says, he is a gentleman, and a Southern one at that. He knows how to hold a conversation and is curious and inquisitive. He wants to have a large family some day, possibly out in the country. He takes exceptionally good care of himself and is always striving to improve. He is a spiritual man and believes in God. Please feel free to reach out if you want to know more about me.

But maybe this search is less about being unbroken or searching for the unbroken, and instead about whether our broken pieces miraculously fit together in a way that feels right. With this in mind, I ask you to indulge me in a story exchange. Thats all. Well, mostly all. I mean, if we end up falling in love and getting married, well I \*suppose\* I could tolerate that outcome. No expectations, though. Id like our chemistry to guide us, so I hesitate to impose too much structure on this offer. The only requirement is vulnerability and honesty. Can we explore and be explored so shamelessly that it would otherwise be abrasive if not for the warmth and tenderness that blanket each interaction? Thats the line I like to walk.

I'd normally write an entire novel of my life, to give an insight in who I am at a deeper level, to hopefully find a close and deep bond with someone. But maybe that isn't the best approach for now. I have a good life. I am happy with myself, and with what I have done the past few years. I have a bunch of close friends, and all kinds of other friends and acquaintances, all over the world. I have plans for holidays with some of them, even (alas, Corona). I have a nice job that I enjoy doing and that gives me a lot of freedom. I am free. But (you had not expected this word at all~). I want to find what I wrote in the title of this message. I have it, mind, with some of my closer friends. But I want to get to know someone, hours flying by as we chat, learning of each other, exhanging views on all kinds of subjects, sharing the tiniest irrelevant thoughts that disappear after a moment, and sharing the more intimate or private thoughts that are part of your personal lifestory. I want you to, eventually, know me better than I know myself. I want you to know the minute nuance of what different ways of greeting you a good morning implies about my own mood. I want you to know what and why and how I think on all kinds of topics. I want to gain energy, from our chatting, looking forward to chatting with you again and again. How will I find that? Good question. I leave that up to you, dear reader. I don't know for sure if there are certain characteristics or qualities that you should have for us to click so nicely, but I can guess as to what might help. Depth, of course. Wanting to open up, the ability to feel comfortable, vulnerable. Not minding textual messages, as it is rare-ish that I can call. A positive outlook on life and on your self. Independence, self-confidence, mental strenght. Stubbornness? An appreciation of the little things? Vitality, adventurousness, ignoring your own comfort zone? A bit of silliness? Playing around with references, witticisms, puns, words? But you can certainly be very different on some of these points, they are no 'deal breakers'. Feel free to reply however you wish (in a PM) to this post. You could only drop your name, age, gender, and a means of direct communication. You could tell me a bit about yourself, your personality, your life, any fancy stories you have or important moments you had. That one amazing holiday, that great friend you lost and found again, your experiences with love. What you do on an average day, the subjects that interest you, the food that you love. As deep as you want to make it. Ideally with some path leading to direct communication, but if you wish to exchange a few PMs first, sure! For now, my arm hurts - I'm typing this on my phone - so bella ciao, beautiful people, and face the mirror with a smile! o/"

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

Id probably most accurately be described as slightly above a filthy casual, have a wonderful, rich, busy, full life outside of any such hobbies, and am a little worried that Ill *prooobably* attract a bunch of 18 year league streamers who want to brag about their solo diamond rating, which is really not my cup of tea (no offense). Im just a (mostly) normal, (very) healthy, (hopefully) wholesome, (possibly) good-looking guy out here looking for his forever person. No big deal or anything. Video games have always held a special place in my heart. Im old enough to remember playing that 8-bit tank game on the Atari when I was a kid, growing up through the Nintendo consoles (until 64, ended on a high note), and finding both a sense of community and escape in the worlds they offered. It was one of the few times Id ever sit down with my dad or brother and just chill and have fun as a family, and I remember going over to friends houses after a long day at junior high specifically for the purpose of helping them get the invincibility cheat in Goldeneye. Theyve also always offered a needed escape from reality when childhood was less than great, and even now provide a calming getaway from the stresses of work and adult life. Their stories, characters, landscapes, and lore have always appealed to my itch for fantasy (and possibly my aversion to reading outside of an academic setting) and its been interesting to watch them transform from something only super antisocial nerdy kids do in their basement into an artform, and even a profession (which I will always find both highly confusing and brilliant). I think Ive always preferred the agency and control the player has in driving these stories forward to simply being a spectator at a movie or in a book, and find that even a little such investment makes me care infinitely more about what happens in a plot. I can still vividly remember reaching the finale of BioShock Infinite (dont worry I wont ruin it) and being *palpably shaken* by the ending, pacing around the house muttering dude what the *fuuuck* and wanting to dive right back in to experience the journey all over again. I love *starting* those adventures. You know those first steps you take into the grass outside of Pallet Town with your starter Pokmon (always Charmander, fight me) and embrace all the possibilities of what might await you? Or escaping from Helgen Keep, free to wander any which way and create any number of an infinity of lives for your character? That shit is my *jam*. Sometimes Ill save and quit just before delving into an unknown dungeon, or right after entering a new area ripe for exploration - just to give myself something to look forward to all day at work until getting home. I *love* studying various build frameworks, reading the *super nerdy* theorycrafting posts on how to squeeze every bit of damage out of your favorite class, and even conjuring up some level of backstory to make my in-game decisions carry a bit more weight. I also love stopping to smell the roses, exploring low-level content, enjoying beautiful vistas on the road from one quest to the next, and modding the ever living shit out of everything because *obviously* bears shouldnt be able to report crimes you commit in the wilderness to the guards, come on Im trying to have an immersive experience here. Im also baffled and amazed by the level of creativity and ingenuity the gaming community has come up with over the years. Ever watch a 12 year old German kid explain his inspiration for the *astonishingly beautiful* Minecraft castle he build block by block? Like bro, I could barely write my name at your age and youre like a visionary architect? Or ever spend hours scouring the internet (back in the day) for how to get past that one level or boss or puzzle (bonus: if [this](URL image means anything to you, I will actually buy you a pizza) only to find some unsung hero on page 41 of the comments with the solution? I think it has a way of bringing people together in a beautiful way, and hope to see that trend continue - especially in these otherwise isolating times. So yeah, theres my unsolicited dissertation on the deeper sociopsychological significance of video games. Arent you glad you clicked on this already?  Oh, but this is a personals post, not a philosophy discussion board. Right. Im supposed to be attracting a mate who might want to potentially keep me alive while fighting dragons and also see me naked a lot. In-game and in person, respectively, in case that warrants clarification My love life in 5 easy to digest bullet points: - I was a late bloomer. Super, *suuuper* awkward and lanky and slightly emo child, thought girls had cooties until like high school, and by then was accepted as the weird kid so obviously didnt do the whole so do your parents want to drive us to the movies after soccer? thing. - My first longterm relationship was in grad school, in my early 20s. We were best friends - and turned out to be better friends than more than friends over our 4 years together. I was highly relationship-immature and she was completely addicted to her work. Also, coincidentally, pretty addicted to dumb mobile games (so, like, please dont be), though I certainly was a far-from-perfect partner myself. Not at all compatible, but we left on really good terms and have sporadically kept in touch with nothing but wholesome well wishes. - I then dated a redditor years ago in my late 20s (yes, it happens!) which was interesting because she was literally my type down to a T and we were everything each other has ever wanted - and we were absolutely miserable together. Long history there that was beyond anything we could have done better, but a bit of a shocking wakeup call about attraction vs. compatibility. I also never felt like I really *knew* who she was, if that makes any sense, and learned I definitely cant be kept at an arms length for too long. - Since then, Ive had a few big moves and career jumps and have honestly not bothered outside of a small handful of disappointing first dates (and a few *actually crazy* people, so please dont be that either). Ive talked to quite a few people online in that time, and have immense hope in the knowledge that some of you are *incredibly beautiful, wonderful, amazing humans* and that one of you out there might just be mine. - Further thoughts because I promised 5 points and dont want to scroll up and change the original number: - I tend to be an all in kind of guy, but am trying to temper that with some of the wisdom and patience that are supposed to come along with my advanced age. Im very in touch with my emotions and know what I like/want/cant deal with, and Id likely rather jump in and smack my head on the concrete than risk losing out entirely by calculating on the sidelines. - I think attraction (in its many forms, not just the immediate physical) is important, but have learned that *organic, effortless, natural* compatibility is so much more important in the long term - which has sparked a slightly-more-than-passing interest in understanding personality types, astrology, tendencies, and other ways of empathizing with other people rather than trying to make them something theyre not. - I spend a lot of time around old people and like to think Ive learned some wisdom along the way, at least in terms of whats really important in the big picture. Im mostly drawn to character traits that last - kindness, compassion, commitment, communication, and a sense of humor are among such attractive qualities. Cool if you have nice boobs and all, but Id much rather you be able to make me laugh until my face hurts. - Like all the smart people say, communication is *the* most important thing in building a healthy relationship, and Im really hoping to foster vulnerability in communication from square one. Obviously I love longform writing (and reading - go on, push the character limit of the message box to the brink!) but am also highly partial to *actually talking* and the intimacy and attention that dropping everything else for a few hours and focusing totally on the other person can offer. I find video to be *completely distracting* in general in case thats a big must on your end. Also, not a huge fan of casual texting, as I feel it often assumes far too much comfort and indifference to nurture anything of substance. So how does this connect with the whole premise of my post? Right. Easily distracted. Making a point now. I dont know about you, but I cant think of a more romantic way to spend a Friday evening than downloading some trashy P2W MMO and leveling up together while mercilessly making fun of it. Or spending a few hours gearing up for raiding with some deep conversation over a mindless grinding session (in-game, get your mind out of the gutter ~~unless~~) Or introducing one another to our old favorite games and explaining how certain mechanics work. I actually think that can say *a lot* about a person and their ability to foster a healthy relationship with inclusive communication and patience vs. ugh just give me the controller youre doing it all wrong I think it can also reflect real-life personality in terms of conflict resolution (do you alt+F4 when things get tough or stick it out with your party?), stress management (do you audibly yell at your dude for missing an easy shot or laugh it off and move on?), and wholesomeness (do you go out of your way to help new players or promote positivity, or are you that toxic backseat raid leader who whines about every last detail that you could have done better?) There *are* real people on the other end of the orcs and elves, and its important to me to remember that and treat them as such. Unless someones being a douche, in which case Ill fully expect your unconditional support in camping their corpse or making their life a living hell until they log out. Ive always loved RPGs - from the OG Zelda games to Final Fantasy to Chrono Trigger to the Baldurs Gate series to those random fan-translated JRPGs you had to find on some seedy emulator site to Skyrim, anything story-driven with freedom to explore an open world is right up my alley. Ive never seen the appeal of shooters or MOBAs or linear platform games, though I can think of a few in each of those categories with a really rich journey and rewarding storyline. I can be both a bit of a completionist achievement hunter (because getting that one last secret item the devs hid is *important damnit* would you read an entire book only to stop before the final page?) and also a super zen enjoy-the-moment old man (i.e. ignoring the dragons and impending doom facing the entire world and setting up a quaint little farm outside of town and hunting game for food). I typically lean towards any hardcore/realism mods that really make you step back and think every decision instead of just rushing in with your invincible guy who cant possible die and bulldozing through everything in your path - I think theres something to be said for delayed gratification and having to really work for things to make them feel more rewarding. That epic piece of armor or rare item would be meaningless if just anyone could get it with relative ease, after all. And I *love* the feeling of taking my character from some weak level 1 scrub who can barely kill a chicken to a god-destroying hero, forged in the blood of his enemies, capable of wrestling with the big bad guy, vested with all the hopes and prayers of the innocent people hes encountered along the way (who are apparently content to still wander around their cabbage farms instead of grabbing some armor and fighting in the face of certain annihilation) Again, I want to stress that all of this is a hobby and a pastime, not a defining pillar of self-identity, and that this post is mostly a creative writing exercise in the hopes of finding someone of a similar inclination. If this is your lifeblood and you can only hold conversations about how great your last cosplay at gamercon was and frequently live off mountain dew and doritos, we may not get along. But maybe such a shared passion can offer some necessary compatibility and connection to build something truly beautiful and lasting. Oh, and I have no idea how I see this actually playing out, as the thought of whacking a giant kobold on our scantily clad anime warrior toons at 3am as they make high-pitched sex noises while we breathily whisper taunt up in 5, Ill pull this next group literally makes me shudder. Maybe you can help make this less awkward because I clearly have no idea what Im doing? I am definitely looking for something: - longterm (forever sounds cringey but thats definitely the endgame - with marriage and possibly a family [way] down the road) - monogamous (I dont share, *at all*, but I *guess* you can heal other players if they stand in fire) - comfortable (I find great value in being able to just be ourselves around each other, and feeling like weve always known each other somehow) - compatible (there are so many little nuances to character, especially as you get older, and its a wonder how any two people can stand being around each other - but its super important to me that we just *fit* and complement each other in *all the ways*) - intense (Im not one for bland flavors, and can be rather voracious in the right hands - the thought of going through the motions for the rest of my life is terrifying) Some unpopular, but important, opinions: - Im extremely anti-ghosting - I think this is one of the most disgusting, horrible things humans have come up with, and think its the most cowardly, immature way to close a connection. Please - if there is *literally any possibility at all for any reason* that you might ever just disappear without even a goodbye, kindly dont reach out at all, as I absolutely do not invite that energy into my life in any form. - I think sexuality is the most beautiful expression of love and trust and intimacy and hope to have *so much* of it *all the time* - with the right person. I dont see it as a commodity and dislike the gesture of needing a test drive before getting invested - I really dont think youll be disappointed when the time comes, but its also important that we want to fuck each others brains out fairly constantly (and creatively). I see inexperience in that realm as a *plus* - as long as you have an insatiable imagination and are kinky but dont ever want to call me daddy. - I take *really* good care of myself - I nerd out on diet/nutrition stuff, work out several times a week, am more than ready for a day-long hike at the drop of a hat, and am of sound mental, spiritual, and emotional health - it is *extremely important* to me that you share these qualities, and not just a desire to work on it. While I sincerely wish the best to anyone dealing with fitness or identity or happiness struggles (and have certainly leveled up through my own) wed be wasting each others time if we werent on the same page here. I say this as a disclaimer in a post geared towards a gaming community, realizing the stereotype of the depressed, overweight neckbeard is a real thing - and assuring you that it wouldnt work out if were not on similar stages of our physical and mental health journeys. I *really* hope that doesnt come off as douchey, but just dont ever want to waste anyones time that simply wouldnt be compatible. - Im definitely attracted *far* more to intelligence, kindness, wholesomeness, and humor than anything physical - but being that we cant really help what we are drawn to and cant really logic our way out of liking certain things, I am *all* about the totally natural, girl-next-door, roll out of bed and throw on some jeans and a sweater and go type. I find makeup, piercings, tattoos, and anything else that we werent shipped with to be mostly off-putting (hey, this is not *at all* a judgement, whatsoever - just being up front with instinctual things I cant do much about so as not to waste anyones time. We are all beautiful in our own way, and never let some random guy on the internet make you feel any less for who you are and how you express your beauty!) - I crave exhaustive communication. Like stay up until 4 in the morning on the phone because fuck sleep theres this *awesome person* on the other end I want to know *everything* about. Long letters pouring our hearts and minds and souls to each other. Clear, effusive expression of feelings a la Hey, I know you were joking earlier about finding a random healer on trade chat, but its still lingering in a weird way and I think its important that we can talk about things like that, especially about uncomfortable topics that may not be fun to open up about. Also, Ill die a little inside if ever asked so how was your day? and dont understand small talk at all so might respond curiously if met with such vapidity. Also also, the ability to carry a conversation is apparently a lost art and I genuinely dont understand treating dialogue like a short answer on a school test just meant to provide minimal information. haha yeah I like that show too *crickets* - simply does not compute in my brain and I wont know what to do with that as I sit back and try to read into some deep thought process that likely isnt there. Its important that we both *want* and *choose* to be here, and that this is a *priority* in both of our lives. So, if youve made it this far and havent been scared off yet, by all means say hello! I promise to reply to anyone who puts some time into a response, even if its to politely say Hey, thanks for the message, but I dont think wed work out and dont want to waste your time. Take care! and, honestly, Im hoping this doesnt get super popular because my monogamist brain doesnt even like the prospect of *talking* to more than one person at a time. Lets keep it chill but be clear with intentions and feelings as we go? But please - look, this post has over 3,000 words and took me several days to put together: you can do better than hey wanna chat?. Im trying to treat this with the gravity of potentially talking to my potential *person* for the first time, and Id appreciate if you could do the same. Oh, and Im *very good* with shy/introverted/quiet/nerdy people, so just be yourself - Ill almost definitely find it adorable Ill just be here all day trying not to touch my face and freaking out at how much trying not to touch my face makes me want to touch my face. Stay safe, be good to one another, wash your hands, and best wishes on your journeys. ----- So I posted this last week on another subreddit (one I thought was more apropos of current events and social distancing) and it did fairly well - though I didn't receive any responses I felt compelled to follow through with (outside of a few dozen *perplexing* one-liners and even an angry troll or two). I would, however, like to address the most frequent comment so as to not waste anyone's time in feeling the need to point it out further: Yes. I know this is a long post - I wrote it. You really don't need to inform me of its length. I'm (obviously) looking for someone who loves words and introversion and stories and longform communication, and am well aware that most posts here are a short list of TV shows and books, looking to pass idle time with intermittent texting. I'm not at all trying to play to a popular audience or attract the widest swath of potential conversation partners - I'm doing *my best* to share an authentic little glimpse of *myself* in the hopes of resonating with *one* person who can be bothered to spend more than 30 seconds reading some words I wrote. Shouldn't we all be striving to be our most natural, unapologetic selves, rather than trying to fit some arbitrary trending mold? To each their own, and I am definitely not everyone's cup of tea! I'm just highly confused at the indomitable compulsion to express the obvious. Believe it or not, we *are* free to live and let live, and we *can* simply pass along without needing to share needless negativity :) Also - this took me *several days* to write and be happy enough with to share with the world - so clearly I'm in no rush here. If you choose to reach out (which would be awesome, really! you totally should!) please feel free to take your time - I'd much prefer a heartfelt dissertation weeks from now to a ""let me get my foot in the door"" chat request (which I don't know how to use...) that's had no time to settle. Come on, don't act like you're *so busy* doing nothing at home for the next few weeks... (Clarification for those with bad seats: the more words, the better. Bring it.)"

(rip the dream) The rest of this post will have a fairly intentional tone, but, if you only want to hang out with another believer for a few days when Im in town, Id probably be cool with that. Made this generally because why not? Ex-math major, ex-seminarian, ex-travel agent, future doctor? Something like that, who knows where the Lord will have me in a few years time. The journey in and of itself is a pretty wild one, would love to share it when we swap stories. Im eclectic in my hobbies. The aforementioned hiking and camping above! I love the outdoors. Being in Dallas, I miss the snow something fierce. I really want to do a backpacking trip one day. I dont brag on much, but Im really, really good at medium rare rib eyes; just saying. Recently finished a book called A Loving Life, working thru a fantasy series called Malazan, almost done with a book called Gospel Fluency, and just started another book called How We Love. Ive built my own computer and am a total nerd. Board games, video games, (and super recently) started playing DnD with a group of co-workers during our lunch break a couple of times a week, hah. Yeah, bro, I lift too. I broke my ankle a few months back, and have been hitting the gym again for the past month and a half. The goal is eventually (relative to body weight) 3x DL, 2x squat, 1.5x bench, 1x ohp. Currently also doing a couch to 10k program at a 6 percent incline because, apparently, I hate myself. I got into bonsai a few years ago, ask me about it! But, dont probe too deeply, I gave away my trees a few months back, and my heart is still brokennnnnnn. My favorite movies Ive seen the past few year or so are: Little Women, Knives Out, Your Name, and Train to Busan. Currently jamming to the first single by this artist called RICHLIN, Royal Blood. Just had dinner with a couple of buddies last night, good old Texas BBQ. More than that, I think dedication is more important than passion (though, strive for both, you know?). I think an argument in a relationship is the two of you vs the problem. I think reflecting Christ means humbling oneself and marking the other person as more important than yourself. I want to be challenged in my faith and personal growth, and in turn to challenge and, God-willing, lead with gentleness, respect, and strength. Im looking for a best friend and someone I can encourage and cheer on for the rest of my life. On of my few strengths is laughing at myself, so hey, feel free to laugh at me, with me. I currently help take care of one year olds during one of the services at church. I disciple peers at a Bible study program we do. Also host a small group of single dudes; trying to model vulnerability and candidness to a few guys who have never really had that before is tiring work! I tend to chase after people that are looked over or are loners, no idea why. I love The Office, and judging on the first few episodes Ive watched, Im going to love Schitts Creek. Youre catching me with a poor nights sleep (and waking up like 3 hours earlier than I normally do, go figure), so excuse the rambling nature and the poor grammar. Here are the caveats: Im a short Asian guy living in Texas. Hah, I know the online dating stats on that. Im not everyones cup of tea. My openness and the expectation of openness in a partner has proven to be difficult for people that are not used to it: I trust hard pretty quickly. Im a GIGANTIC why person. No, Im not attacking your beliefs or actions, Im genuinely curious in why people do things. Im a huge introvert, so I tend to ease into large groups rather than dive right in; though, of course, small group/one on one is my comfort zone (so yeah, Ill eventually meet your friends.... maybe). Also, Im really bad at selfies, so grab coffee with me if youre local, or hit me up on Skype to get a better idea, hah. If you can click/vibe/groove/whatever with what Ive written above, drop me a line. If your heart chases after Christ, you care about the least of these, and youve got an extreme bantery/inappropriate humor side, send me a message as well, even if I dont seem that interesting to you, because you definitely have my interest, hah. My picture gets yours (maybe? F eel free to go about your day and be disappointed after viewing). Make sure you have a good day (or not, you dont need an stranger on the internet telling you what to do)! TLDR; I totally just won the lottery and am looking for someone to support for the rest of her life, no prenup needed. Pre hair donation URL Recent crappy selfie URL"

I'm not usually embarrassed to go against expectations (in fact, I generally enjoy it) so I'm not sure why I'm hesitant to admit I'm interested in someone younger. But I'm going to ignore that and dive right in. A bit about me... I'm 39 and live in a flyover state that I love. I'm a short, thicc divorced mom of 2 young boys. I work in education. I love sports (college football especially), reading, and traveling (ask me about my big trip that starts in less than 3 weeks). I have plenty of free time to communicate but very little free time to go out so your location doesn't matter to me. Yet I still crave attention from 1 special person, so I'm willing to try alternative avenues like Reddit. If you'd have asked me my type just a couple years ago, I'd have said older and teddy bear-like. And while I'm not ruling that out either, tastes evolve for one reason or another so here I am trying something different. A bit about you... While I'm open to someone younger, I have my limits. You must be 25+. Physically I prefer clean cut (boy next door type) and athletic with thick dark hair. Mentally you must be mature, intelligent, responsible, and self reliant with amazing communication skills. I want someone who loves to talk and carry on long, detailed conversations. Please be mentally healthy as I'm looking for someone that will bring positivity into my life. However I also really enjoy caring for someone emotionally, so be capable of vulnerability. Be willing to spend some time getting to know me before expecting anything. Then if we really click, all doors are open. And finally, I will not chat with anyone that wants to remain anonymous. It's a bit creepy and means you clearly have something to hide. I'm an open book and you absolutely must be, too. I have posted here before but nothing worked out, so look at my post from a few weeks ago to get a better feel for me and to see a different picture. And if you're interested after everything I've said, hmu via message (NOT chat) and include a picture. URL"

So I recently got out of a long-term, serious relationship, and while we ended things on good terms, it definitely created a hole. In the months since, Ive realized what I need is someone I can have a totally unfiltered conversation with. Ive given a couple dating apps a shot, but Im finding all the swiping to be a waste of time, and somewhat depressing. Of course, Im sure youd like to know more about me before taking the plunge. Luckily enough for you, Im a pretty open book. First and foremost, Im extremely honest. I work hard to communicate my feelings and intent, and to make sure nobody is hurt on account of my failure to communicate. If you need someone to tell it to you straight, Im your guy. Also, while I dont feel it is a huge part of my personality, I am pansexual, and prefer they/them or he/him pronouns. I like they/them most, but Im not super picky. Oh, and my preferred name is Kit. Physically, I am pretty small. Im 510-511 and 130 lbs. I love running, but havent run in the last year or so due to how busy Ive been. So now that the more boring stuff is out of the way, you get to learn about some of the stuff I like! Im a pretty big nerd. Im pretty into history, world-building, writing, video games, D&amp;D (and other similar games), and film as an art. Im also and artist. I love drawing, and am working on turning it into a source of income as well. In addition to being a huge nerd, Im also kind of a hippy? I grew up in that kind of community and I guess it rubbed off. I use words like vibes and energy when talking about how people or situations give me a particular feeling or impression. I dont put stock in astrology, but its fun, and I like the idea of being a Libra. I also really love meditation, incense, candles, nature (especially forests and mountains), animals, prayer flags and philosophy. Oh, I also curse a lot in casual conversation, and my sense of humor probably takes a bit of getting use to? I tend to need an adjustment period to get comfortable with someones sense of humor, so I bet its a me thing. Im pretty optimistic in general, but I am sure to stay grounded in reality. Im an INFJ, if that matters to you. Im very emotionally open. Im not afraid to say Im feeling in a bad way, or to show vulnerability because thats how you grow and bond. Spontaneity tends to stress me out unless Im high (oh btw I smoke the devils lettuce), and I like to have a plan for things. It just helps me relax and enjoy the experience. So yeah. Thats me. Hit me up if you wanna talk. I plan to move back to Alaska at the end of June, so keep that in mind if this novel was enough to make you interested in a relationship. ~Kit"
155,vulnerability,r4r,39 [F4R] We're more than the sum of our parts,1,f630n2,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/f630n2/39_f4r_were_more_than_the_sum_of_our_parts/,2020-02-19 12:43:08,"What's most interesting about formulating an ad about yourself is the realization that maybe, just maybe, the right kinda person will see your carefully scripted description and you'll pique their interest. After all, we all just want to be seen, heard and wanted, to varying degrees. Lists about who we are (or are not), our likes, our desires, our dreams, our pasts, our flaws and less-desirables, the things we place value in--these are just tiny particles that come together to make us who we are. We will always be more than the sum of these parts and that is one of the most beautiful truths. Like most of the folks on here, I'm looking for something but it's vaguely undefined. Each person holds a potential in a connection, and genuine connection is what I desire the most. A true friend, a real relationship, a confidante, a homie to shoot the shit with--there is room in my life and heart for any and/or all of these. Things I value the most are: honesty, integrity, empathy, compassion and a soft spot for the human condition. That quote about being kind to people because you never know what battles they're fighting...yeah, this is of utmost importance to me. Show me your realness and vulnerability and I promise I will always do the same-- there isn't anything more meaningful than that. So, who is this chic waxing poetic on modern day pseudo spiritual ways of being and seeking? Well, I'm a 39 year old from the USA (east coast). I'm a single mom of four, a vegan since '99 and straightedge since' 96--- those are the 3 biggies that turn most people off, so I may as well push them to the top! (The great thing about me is that I'm non-judgmental and Hella accepting about other people's journeys so I don't expect a carbon copy of me, I just ask that my lifestyle choices be respected similarly.) I'm a cat lady, an INFJ, listen to Manchester Orchestra wayyy too much and find being in nature a necessary component to true happiness. I'm not a gamer but I fucks with Scrabble like no one's business. Tattoos are a big part of my personhood as is my never-ending quest for personal growth. The smell of impending rain, chunky peanut butter, long drives to nowhere, and giggling uncontrollably are a few of my favorite things. Books will always be important to me, and art and artists forever inspire me. I'm a fairly equal mix of punkrawk, hippie and earth goddess but have no expectations in someone else. And now that my TED talk has reached it's capacity and the reader's attention span, I wish you much love on your journey, fellow redditor. I hope you find what you're looking for because we all deserve something great "

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."

Would love a camping/hiking/brunch/sunrise service buddy, or honestly, someone to just point me to a Christ-loving church I can go to that Sunday. The rest of this post will have a fairly intentional tone, but, if you only want to hang out with another believer for a few days when Im in town, Id probably be cool with that. Made this generally because why not? Ex-math major, ex-seminarian, current travel agent, future doctor? Something like that, who knows where the Lord will have me in a few years time. The journey in and of itself is a pretty wild one, would love to share it when we swap stories. Im eclectic in my hobbies. The aforementioned hiking and camping above! I love the outdoors. Being in Dallas, I miss the snow something fierce. I really want to do a backpacking trip one day. I dont brag on much, but Im really, really good at medium rare rib eyes; just saying. Recently finished a book called A Loving Life, working thru a fantasy series called Malazan, almost done with a book called Gospel Fluency, and just started another book called How We Love. Ive built my own computer and am a total nerd. Board games, video games, (and super recently) started playing DnD with a group of co-workers during our lunch break a couple of times a week, hah. Yeah, bro, I lift too. I broke my ankle a few months back, and have been hitting the gym again for the past month and a half. The goal is eventually (relative to body weight) 3x DL, 2x squat, 1.5x bench, 1x ohp. Currently also doing a couch to 10k program at a 6 percent incline because, apparently, I hate myself. I got into bonsai a few years ago, ask me about it! But, dont probe too deeply, I gave away my trees a few months back, and my heart is still brokennnnnnn. My favorite movies Ive seen the past few year or so are: Little Women, Knives Out, Your Name, and Train to Busan. Currently jamming to the first single by this artist called RICHLIN, Royal Blood. Just had dinner with a couple of buddies last night, good old Texas BBQ. More than that, I think dedication is more important than passion (though, strive for both, you know?). I think an argument in a relationship is the two of you vs the problem. I think reflecting Christ means humbling oneself and marking the other person as more important than yourself. I want to be challenged in my faith and personal growth, and in turn to challenge and, God-willing, lead with gentleness, respect, and strength. Im looking for a best friend and someone I can encourage and cheer on for the rest of my life. On of my few strengths is laughing at myself, so hey, feel free to laugh at me, with me. I currently help take care of one year olds during one of the services at church. I disciple peers at a Bible study program we do. Also host a small group of single dudes; trying to model vulnerability and candidness to a few guys who have never really had that before is tiring work! I tend to chase after people that are looked over or are loners, no idea why. I love The Office, and judging on the first few episodes Ive watched, Im going to love Schitts Creek. Youre catching me with a poor nights sleep (and waking up like 3 hours earlier than I normally do, go figure), so excuse the rambling nature and the poor grammar. Here are the caveats: Im a short Asian guy living in Texas. Hah, I know the online dating stats on that. Im not everyones cup of tea. My openness and the expectation of openness in a partner has proven to be difficult for people that are not used to it: I trust hard pretty quickly. Im a GIGANTIC why person. No, Im not attacking your beliefs or actions, Im genuinely curious in why people do things. Im a huge introvert, so I tend to ease into large groups rather than dive right in; though, of course, small group/one on one is my comfort zone (so yeah, Ill eventually meet your friends.... maybe). Also, Im really bad at selfies, so grab coffee with me if youre local, or hit me up on Skype to get a better idea, hah. If you can click/vibe/groove/whatever with what Ive written above, drop me a line. If your heart chases after Christ, you care about the least of these, and youve got an extreme bantery/inappropriate humor side, send me a message as well, if I dont seem that interesting to you, because you definitely have my interest, lol. My picture gets yours (maybe? Hahaha, feel free to go about your day and be disappointed after viewing). Make sure you have a good day (or not, you dont need an stranger on the internet telling you what to do)! TLDR; I totally just won the lottery and am looking for someone to support for the rest of her life, no prenup needed. Pre hair donation URL Recent crappy selfie URL"

Here's a list of qualities that I'm looking for, all of these are flexible within reason: 1. I would prefer that you're also a professional student, resident or working professional.

Over the weekend I met this incredible woman at a wine bar called Lagniappe here in Miami. Immediately we talked as if weve known each other for years. There wasnt that awkward moment you typically feel when meeting someone for the first time. We shared everything about our lives, our goals and aspirations. I even learned she lived in the same small town in Guatemala I used to live in as a wee lad. What are the odds. Her eyes gazed at me, never looking elsewhere. She curled and played with her hair looking at me, nibbling on her lips from time to time, hand on my knee. My guard was at an all time low. I could feel the vulnerability of opening up and letting someone in. We high fived and fist bumped all the time. We walked wynwood. Walking extremely close to one another. You could feel that good tension. We danced. The story of our first kiss was one for the books. Earlier she had told me about my Aztec guardian animal and gave me quite a comprehensive lesson on the hypothalamus. So while dancing, I leaned in to ask her about it but I think she thought I leaned in for a kiss. Imagine a bullet grazing your cheek but instead of a bullet it was her lips grazing the side of my cheeks. She turned red. So I put my hand on her face and put her closer to me for an actual kiss. We kept dancing. Bodies close. Faces close. Lips close. Teasing here and there. It was magical. My heart was racing. On the way back, we were in the back seat. Her head on my shoulder, hands intertwined with mine. Id occasionally kiss her on the cheeks and forehead. Shed then kiss me on the lips. I knew I was going home and odds are after this knight well never see one another again. I gave her the longest hug and kiss good bye. I looked back and she looked at me. I could see she felt it too. It took me moving from California to Miami to meet this girl. Now Im here on ocean of emptiness that is my bed. I got a taste of what its like to have someone. Prior I had nothing to lose but after this weekend Ive lost something I cared for so much after only a night. Now Im writing this in hopes for finding that spark with someone else. It may never happen but the purpose of me writing this was to tell someone the feeling Ive been harboring inside. This is me URL URL"

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

I just want someone to wash my hair in the sink and comb it. Warm up some easy macaroni and cheese lol. Mostly, I want to crawl under a blanket and snuggle under a sofa, while this dark winter passes by. Listen to an audiobook or have one read to me. I just want to feel safe and connected for a little bit. I dont expect a relationship or anything. Those are very high risk, high reward. I dont want another person leaving from my life. I just want some genuine comfort. Im finding a bit relief just writing this out. Its always scary to find out how deep your vulnerability goes. Ive had some really terrible things happen to me for years. Nothing anyone should ever go through. Life just wants me to be strong and jump back in. I am strong, but it seems that I need space to feel at times, too."

Interestingly, one month earlier I had posted nearly the exact same request on r/r4r. My plea was a bit more violent and self-indulgent, but the sentiment was all the same. Take me. Take my heart. Love me and then rip it all to pieces. I guess heartbreak fetishes are a thing now. We began speaking and from the initial message, he was everything. We worked in the same industry and had many of the same necessities for privacy and discretion. Almost instantaneously, both of us were happy to abandon many of those requirements in return for intimacy and vulnerability. I jumped on an opportunity to attend a conference where he lived just 12 days after our first exchange. We agreed to meet at the hotel bar where I was staying. He found me in the crowd and we spoke for a few minutes but it was overwhelming and my colleagues surrounded us in a way that made meaningful conversation difficult. So I took him back to my room. I am not sure that I knew exactly what would go down by bringing him there but I desperately wanted us to be together alone. I should mention, I havent slept with a man in over six years. I primarily date women, so I was nervous. Also, he was 20 years older than me...and married (not here for the judgement). Maybe because of my experience with women which is consistently passionate and beautifully messy, I had not properly managed my expectations. We laid on the bed and spoke very little. We mostly made out and held each other. In some ways he was reserved and I felt as if I didnt excite him in the way I expected. He did not try to consume me. He was able to just be there and look at my eyes and somehow that was enough for him. We made a plan to meet twice a year and go on an overnight trip together to somewhere outside the cities where we live. Something romantic, like a cabin in the woods where we would lock the door and unplug all the clocks. Looking back on that I dont know that we bonded enough to go through the trouble of another meeting. I wanted to, but there just was not enough time. I havent heard from him since that night and in my heart I know I may not hear from him again. If I had to get on the plane and cross four states to meet a stranger from Reddit and try to fall in love, I am glad it was with him. Ultimately, neither of us suffered a broken heart, but the knowing what could have been does present the slightest longing and ache. tl;dr: I hooked up with my grandfather. There were no butterscotch candies but overall it was a pleasant experience."

I am a pretty confident person in all aspects of my life except for, well, dating. I havent found the one yet and part of that falls squarely on my shoulders; part of it doesnt. My hopes with this post is to give some insight to someone who has talked to thousands of people over the years. So I wanna give some tips on what has worked and hasnt worked in hopes that, in general, someone learns from my mistakes. I will lay these out as observations followed with problems and the solution Ive used to remedy this situation. Please tell me I am wrong. Id love for better answers to my recommendations because that will only benefit the sub as a whole ***Observation 1: Conversation happens via PM/IM, not in reddit comments*** It sounds simple but someone commenting on one of my posts: DM ME/Send me a message/etc. isnt something that benefits you and honestly, if I am taking the time to submit a post (some are shorter and some are longer) and your first instinct is just a super-lazy PM ME. Lets talk Im probably NOT going to talk to you. Why would I waste my time when you cant take the extra 3-steps to justmessage me? **Problem:** PM ME as the comment. **Solution:** The bots take care of some of these lower quality comments but move it to, you know, the PM. ***Observation 2: Reddit conversations dont come with health benefits so stop having me call my chiropractor because I have to carry the conversation*** In my last post someone sent Youre funny!.and that was it. So, in hopes that maybe they treat reddit messenger like a text string I asked, Hey! Thanks for the kind words. What about my post stood out to you? What she gave back as a response shouldnt have surprised me but it did. I knew it wasnt meant to be 2 messages in when I got idk, all of it as the message. With that being said, I understand everyone prefers different flows to their conversation. I might make a post with a few paragraphs but I prefer quicker back and forth so Discord or Text is more my cup of tea. Other people want a pen pal type of thing with large drawn out conversations. And both these communication styles are beautifully accepted as is everything else in between. What is not okay is laziness. In language laziness just isnt okay. I am about 415 words in and can already tell you that some people hate that I am making them feel bad about how they respond to posts. And, truthfully, they should. Its actually in the rules that low-quality posts will be deleted. Mods cant enforce low-quality responses be deleted but the requirement of genuine conversation should go both ways. **Problem:** Humans are bad at talking **Solution:** Ask open ended questions. In general, if a question can normally be answered in one or two words then phrase it in a way that draws a conversation out. Dont ask: How was your day? Ask: Tell me about your day Dont ask: Hows the weather Ask: Tell me more about your favorite season DO Talk about things like Religion, Sex, and Politics! Why? **Because they matter.** Bare minimum you are responding to people for friendship but a majority of posts on here are about finding a true partner. You want to know how they handle these situations because these things all impact our life on a daily basis. Do they share similar views? Awesome! If not, how do they talk about their views? Someone can disagree agree with you but do they present their views as right, or just different? If they present them as the former youll seriously need to ask if that foundation will be healthy. *DO ask questions. People wont ever get mad at asking questions.* Where people get upset about questions is when theyve already answered the question. *DO respond to questions they ask in their post.* Sure it might be an ice breaker but they took the time to ask questions to start. Maybe they just saw a new movie so when they ask whats your favorite movie they are wanting to talk to someone thats seen the new *Joker* film. At the end of the day its find to be bad at conversations but its not okay to be lazy. ***Observation 3: Ghosting is a thing*** You know the worse part about being a 6.5, everyone is hoping for an 10 and willing to settle for a 7. Youre above curve but not where people wanna settle. And I know Im above the curve for average looks so If I am getting ghosted I know MANY more are getting ghosted. Its interesting that we are in this point of life. We like talking to people in apps because we can be a little more direct or different but nothing outside of our wheelhouse. Most of you *know* what ghosting is but for those who dont the quick definition is having someone that you believe cares about you, whether it be a friend or someone you are dating, disappear from contact without any explanation at all. No phone call or email, not even a text. Of note this isnt someone who 3 messages in decided to not talk to you and be polite and say bye. The facts are that nearly 50% of people have experienced ghosting and male, female, and everyone between have *done* the ghosting. Why does it happen though? In a recent study there was a variety of reasons given including: &gt;I didn't understand exactly how I actually felt at the time, so instead of trying to talk it out, I ghosted. &gt;I used to disappear when it was all I thought it was [a fling], or I got scared of finding what I wanted Or some kind of fear factor from a past relationship kicks in. &gt;I kind of think that it's part of what makes the online-dating scene so appealing. Since you don't have friends in common or weren't introduced through some other channel, it's not the end of the world if you just drop off the face of the earth. As you can see theres some weird rationales that go into why it happens but at the end of the day you cant control it. I can get preachy and tell everyone that ghosting isnt right and it shouldnt happen but I think that last quote gives some efficacious reasoning to why it happens: Online-dating works because its online. Ghosting happens because its online. I am literally talking to someone right this second that said, I feel like weve talked before and we are trying to figure out if one of us ghosted. HOW fucking full circle is that. *Yes, weve talked before. Why did we stop*. **Problem:** People will ghost **Solution::** Tell them not to. Really. If Ghosting is something that is just a thing that puts you in a bad place be open about that communication. *Hey, I know we just started talking but if we hit a point in which things arent working out will you just say something instead of ghosting me?* THEN if they ghost you at least have some closure that you arent the asshole. But you probably are. Its reddit. Its kind of a requirement. At the end of the day the most important thing to remember is that when someone ghosts you, it has nothing to about you or and everything about the person doing the ghosting. It shows he or she doesnt have the courage to deal with the discomfort of their emotions or yours, and they either don't understand the impact of their behavior or worse dont care. In any case, they have sent you an extremely loud message that says: I dont have what it takes to have a mature healthy relationship with you. Be the better person, retain your dignity, and let him or her go peacefully. Dont allow someone elses bad behavior to rob you of a better future by losing your vulnerability and shutting yourself off from another relationship. Keep your energy focused on doing what makes you happy. Know that if you are someone who treats people with respect and integrity then the ghoster simply wasnt on your wavelength and someone better is coming your way, as long as you keep your heart open and your focus forward. ***Observation 4: Just looking for friends*** As I said above, Ive posted a bunch. LikeI really need to see a therapist about my reassurance issues a lot. Im pretty darn good about making it clear on what Im looking for but for every post I will absolutely get a few Im not looking for a relationship messages. I get it. Not every person wants a relationship and I know that there are plenty of success stories about She said just friends, now we are getting married. Just because a Hail Mary worked in 1975 against the Vikings (damn Cowboys) doesnt make it a sustainable football play. Likewise, when you respond to a non-platonic ad looking for a platonic friend its just not sustainable. Your absolutely worse-case is that you are not respectful of someones time that they took to make a post, waste it, and they miss out on someone else that could be what they are looking for. The best case, from your point, is a friend. And I am severely underestimating the power of friendship (captain planet theme should kick in soon) but I think way to many people underestimate how emptying it is to read Dont worry, I am not looking for anything close to what you are wanting but you should like someone Id like to be friends with so please talk to me. And, on the surface that sounds really shallow, right? My last post only received *checking notes*17 updoots and I received *checks notes* 213 messages. The last post that cracked 450 updoots I had several thousands of messages. And I am a slightly above average guy. Theres a reason that the sub as a 4A/4R option and I wish more people would recognize that it takes a lot to put yourself out there on full blast. So when you see the I am just looking for a friend then it really is kinda of defeating. Some wont admit it and some enjoy finding friends (and for that group Id suggest taking the male-female label off and properly tag your post) but to see hundreds of I have a boyfriend but you sound funny, lol. Friends? is probably not helping anyone else. Is this preachy? For sure. I cant think of a better way to wordsmith this though. Are we really at a point that its okay to ignore what people are looking for? Its almost a meme about Hey, I know youre a lesbian but maybe you havent found the right guy yet and yet I know youre looking for a relationship, maybe you havent found the right friend yet is totally acceptable. **Problem:** People dont read posts **Solution:** People should read posts. This leads me into my next observation ***Observation 6: Generic responses** Ive read some meta posts about how to engage and guarantee a response from female for male posts and I can tell you that safely that those posts are just as useless. The reason being, and I am not being cynical, is that our attention, as a species, just isnt good. Theres a reason that the average resume is read for less than 6 seconds. No joke. And while Id expect a relationship to be a more important aspect to our life, would you really expect someone to spend 12 minutes reading a response when we dont even spend 20 seconds reading one for a career? Generic ice breakers are fine if you are judicious about how you use them. The most common question I get is: *Tom, you seem fascinating, tell me more about you though*. Gosh, thats such a stupid question. That really should be up there in the DO NOT ask questions. But it is asked. And a lot. And honestly, I have answered this so many times my iPhone can answer it simply by me pressing the center button on my predictive text. Its an open question that has a weirdly small answer frame. It is totally acceptable to know that certain questions will be asked and its totally acceptable to know how you want to respond to that. I am a ethnographer and used be the incubator director for one of the largest Indian Tribes in the United States. Do you really think I havent been asked to describe my job before? And thats okay. Its okay to be interested in someones post because they sound interesting but a turn my inbox orange if interested doesnt give you a lot to actually say so you use an ice breaker. Why? Because they list a bunch of movies you also are into. You can ask what about Game of Thrones got them addicted or you can say, Hey, I saw your post. I am also a big GoT fan (Ice Dragonssss) but at last weeks watch party we got into a debate: would a cheeseburger and a hamburger with cheese be the same thing. It doesnt take much but lets be real: a lot of the first chat with anyone is going to just be generic at some point: What do you do for work, Where do you live, how many freaks responded to your post, why do you hate clowns, etc. **Problem:** Responding to people is hard **Solution:** Its okay to have some ice breakers up your sleeve. Please note that I am not advocating for someone to just copy+paste a generic Hey gurl, are you a beaver cuz dam into every post but its okay to have a few interesting questions to ask that will raise the threshold of conversation over other responders. I am nearly 2500 words in and I think Ive insight that will help both sides of the aisle and if not, well, thanks for coming to my TomTalk."

Ive been single for nearly a year, my ex and I broke up because he never wanted to get married despite the lovely 3 years we had together. We ended on amicable terms and Im looking to date again. I have a stable M-F 9-5 job that allows me to be financially independent. I have a very supportive network of friends and family and a range of hobbies that keep my interests. Im about 85% happy with where my life is right now. Id really like to find a romantic partner to help fulfill the last 15%. If Im being honest, Im one of those people who would feel most satisfied and be her best self with a partner. I also really hate being lonely, so theres that. Im looking for someone whos willing to be emotionally available, and even vulnerable, with me. This means someone whos willing to communicate with me when something is wrong, and willing to work out our differences and build a lasting relationship together. This also looks like giving each other chances to be our most authentic selves, even if it might be difficult at times. Look, its like this: we all want to Netflix and Chill^TM, right? Why is Netflix and Chill^TM such a desirable thing? Because its symbolic of a deeper desire: we want to be with someone who we *know* holds affection, fondness, and tenderness for us in their hearts, and take comfort in the fact that they wholly accept who we are. But the key thing were forgetting is that it takes vulnerability to reach this level of comfort with another person. You have to be willing to undo parts of you that hides who you are and allow someone to look inside. Its extremely **scary** to let someone in. What if they see things about us that they dont like? What if they think less of us when they look inside? What if they use what they saw and know about us against us? I have no answers for these questions. All I can say is that, if you let me in, I promise to be gentle and kind. It wont be easy, but it will be worth it. Anyway, **I have photos and videos of myself and my cat Hanabi in my profile that youre free to look at.** Im not always proud of my post history but I cant advocate for being emotionally vulnerable if Im hiding my thoughts, right? So feel free to dig as deep into my post history as youd like. Im open to feedback and thoughts. Thank you for reading!"

The amount of vulnerability involved would require some type of caring and emotional investment. I could keep going but I dont think it will change anything. I think I just wanted to emphasize that Im interested in a friend. Not so much focused on anything else. Well, if you made it this far and even if youre not interested I still think it would be awesome to hear from you just to know that you exist. I guess now I wait."

No STDs is a must and willing to exchange paperwork if asked. I have my life together and am an established mature adult. My main criteria is to be intelligent, have your life going in some direction and not be lost. Im a pretty busy guy with work and career so ideally things could start on a part time basis and see how things go. I have good experience, can be a bit tender at certain times, but can be very strict at others and enjoy playing with control, instructing, and teaching or mentoring. Newbies are ok. I love the mental and emotional aspects of taking control and the trust and vulnerability that comes with it. I wont get into all the details now but ultimately I am looking for a connection even if we meet a few times a month for fun and feeling alive together On a vanilla level, I am a film buff, music lover, like pop culture and speakeasies, always learning and always self-improvement. Love intellectual stimulation, cuddles, wine, cooking. I consider myself high EQ and I look somewhat vanilla, like a modern professor I'm told. After posting this to reddit several times I find its important for me to say that I am seeking someone who doesnt have very serious mental problems and have their lives somewhat together. Sorry to mention this and no judgment if you have. Also I am not attracted to BBWs, again no judgement just not my taste. If you write please state age, location, body type and we can start a conversation and see where it leads. I prefer to start the conversation on vanilla topics.

As 2019 is coming to an end and I am at a crossroads in my life, Ive decided to reevaluate the relationships in my life and and try to pin down the kind of people I want in my life. Im kind, honest and empathetic which has been both a blessing and a curse. The blessing is my conscience is usually clear. The curse would be that people, most of the time, think I have a hidden agenda or its a mask I put on. And its hard to get to know people once they put up that wall. Growth: I am focused on self-love and growth in this chapter in my life. Im looking for people are in a similar boat. Those who want mutual growth and not just caring for someone or being cared for. Life-perspective: everything is fleeting and life is short. Theres so much to do to make the world a better place and that might seem futile at times but it think being good or just trying to make the world a better place by being in it is the cornerstone of how I see the world. Vulnerability: its a tough time where a lot of people are so bent on being savage and not caring. Mostly as defense mechanisms. But Ive come to realize that the rewards albeit being much more rare than risks, are worth it. As humans we spend so much time and effort trying to put walls to protect ourselves but end up losing pieces of ourselves in the process. That is not something that I want for myself anymore. Im consciously trying to be more vulnerable and show my true colors. I am now realizing that this post comes off as really serious but Im a chill person overall and really dorky and silly. I love to smoke up and dork-out. The usual bit: Im 30, I work in software engineering, I have a kid. Im 6ft tall and decent shape. Im somewhere between agnostic and atheist. Im very left-wing politically. About you: youre 25 or older. You are kind, honest and good in communicating. I dont care about race, job or anything else that is arbitrary. If read all of that, thank you! Happy holidays and hopefully this years brings you joy and happiness "

A younger man who wrote like he was pulling prose from a romance novel at times. He was the most different from my personality, and I found that for such a potentially disastrous experiment, he was the perfect partner. Our interactions started in Reddit DMs, moved to kik (ugh) and ended on hangouts. He occasionally wanted to talk on the phone which was hard, and a little outside my comfort, but we made it work. He was unusual and heavy in the way he spoke with me. Occasionally controlling and dismissive, he slowly reveled himself to also be thoughtful, loving, and unexpectedly funny. He was certainly broken in ways he never chose to disclose, though he was remarkably calm as I laid out some of the more problematic aspects of my life. Ultimately, he wanted deep, seductive conversation on his terms and I wanted to know what kind of mother raised him and how to make his eggs. I was scared, sad, happy, confused and increasingly obsessed with our time together. By our last conversation we were planning ways to sneak away together for a weekend. It felt, almost exactly like falling in love without the actual work and significant risk of doing so. We cheated the universe and stole the most savory feelings to share under bed blankets in the middle of the nights. If I was 22, I would be convinced he was my soul mate and that falling in love we would not fix our brokenness, but revel in it like drunks with Prosecco on New Years Eve. Ultimately we didn't make it to our last night. He said goodbye and I, perhaps having more broad prospective (or experience) knew not to fight that. He promised in our first exchange that he would make our goodbye feel like shit. He delivered. It was sad and disorienting. Yet I am grateful I chose him. I felt more in our hours together than I have in an entire year. We smushed in as much passion and honesty and vulnerability as our cracked hearts would allow given what our individual life experiences had been. For the hours it lasted, he was my person. "

Superficially, some things about myself: my favorite shows are Samurai Champloo, The Good Place, Black Mirror... My favorite authors are Carl Sagan, Douglas Adams and, well, I guess a whole bunch of academic people that I read nowadays. I hike and play banjo to unwind and DnD/board games to socialize. A few non superficial things about myself: - I am pretty concerned with living a good/virtuous life, in the sense of loving well, and making things better for myself and others. - I am too critical for my own good. I have been an old man since I was 14. I have an annoying tendency to lecture, and I love to argue as an expression of care, interest, excitement about a topic. I am getting better about apologizing and predicting when I come off as aggressive or patronizing. - I have trauma from the way I was raised. Yay! This takes the form of trying to be of help, instead of being vulnerable and letting my needs and grievances be known. This part of me needs work (I will do the work). - I can be fun, I promise. I am a good humored goof. A downright dork and a big nerd. I think I have a sharp wit? I take things literally but not too seriously, if that makes sense. What or who am I looking for? I'd like to think I can love a lot of different people, and that I have loved a lot of different people. I don't have much of a ""type."" And you certainly have unique needs that I would be keen to discover and act upon. That said, there are a few specifics that can maybe narrow things down. - I'm looking to become more vulnerable. To experiment with that. To play with that. To ground my giving/generosity in that. If things go right, I guess you will have the capacity to hurt me deeply - hopefully you don't hurt that much. Some hurt is acceptable/expected. - Corollary to the above, I'm not looking to avoid being alone...or at least I hope not. - Unfortunately, I am caught up in dissertation writing, and that means that a) I am not willing to do driving longer distances than 1 hour from where I am in the Blacksburg/Roanoke area. b) I am uncertain about my own future, including the long-termedness of what relationships may start. My expectation is that a relationship with me will not last longer than a year, but, for me, that does not preclude love or vulnerability.

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

I think it's because I think better when I'm tipsy or it's something else, I don't know. If I get messages from guys who message me because I'm a woman, I won't reply. Yes.. I kind of want to talk to women more. I don't have much experience with them. I'm open to anything. I'm where I'm supposed to be in life. How do I know that? I feel content. Feeling content is not easy, but here I am feeling it. I started feeling content this year and it's nice, yes. It's nice but I still have many questions. I have questions but no answers. I'm the type to get what they want - always. I'm also arrogant, in a healthy way, I would say. I want to be good in life, do good. Did I figure out life? I'm smiling right now. I did not. Feeling content is one thing. Wanting something so rare and not having it.. is another. I know so much. The things I know are worth nothing in my opinion because it doesn't help me answer my questions. I want to have a strong bond with someone. It doesn't have to be a relationship. I'm extremely picky, high expectations - all that crap. I want to be vulnerable, I want someone to tell me that I'm wrong about the things I know. I want someone to show me the way. Don't get me wrong, I don't want anyone to support me. I never needed it. I can take care of myself and wouldn't accept help anyway because that's simply how I grew up. Taking care of myself. I always forget people. I forget and feel nothing. Is that the reason I want to have a bond with someone? There is one person I didn't forget and that is showing me that I'm not doomed. I don't care what you want from me. If it's something I can give, I will give it to you. I know that only I have the answers to my questions. Yes.. I know what to do. I want you to push me, confuse me, make me want to be vulnerable and more. People think I'm intimidating but they don't know how scared I am. I'm scared of feelings. I'm scared of being vulnerable. I won't deny it. Me writing all these things is easy but actually doing it.. is not. That's what excites me the most right now. I want to do it. When you always get what you want except that one thing you want the most - it makes you feel.. something I can't explain. You need it. You need it like nothing else. I love psychology, I love talking to new people, trying to understand them. I guess I'm very curious about people. Especially weird ones. What people like about me is that I don't judge people, ever. I guess I'm a weird person, I just don't show it. I like reading. I always go to the same cafe, order a cappuccino and read. I'm reading 'a separate mind' at the moment. It's not bad, also not very good. Maybe I will like it later. I also like going to the gym. I like doing new things, being productive. I like going to the library, travelling. I love coffee. What else? Watching movies? Yes. I like movies. What I love the most is talking to new people. I like learning. I want to learn a lot from people. I'm craving intimacy, vulnerability. I want to talk about all the reasons I'm like this. I also want to talk about you. I want phone calls, weird phone calls. I want many things. I feel content, but I'm still feeling kind of lost, looking for answers."

I'm extroverted but still find it hard to make friends. It's hard to find someone that you click with. Sharing interests doesn't always mean you have chemistry. In any case, I'll still list my interests! Animation, art, D&amp;D, fashion, and like 3 video games LMAO. I'm not really a gamer unless you count the hours spent solving Poptropica island mysteries when I was younger. I love sharing the things I love with others and, in turn, learning about them. I really appreciate empathy and emotional vulnerability. I don't really want to go through the process of de-masking until we are both comfortable with each other. I also recently left a very toxic relationship, but with that, I lost the constant company of another person. I'd like it if I had someone to call since I'm home so often!! I only use discord. :) I realize I must sound like a creep right now that doesn't understand R4R or making appealing/inviting posts, but, for now, I'm too tired of trying to make myself exciting for others to test out! It's as simple as: I'll offer you kindness and friendship in return for the same from you!! I don't really know what I'm looking for or what I'm trying to do. I just want somebody to love and love me in return. It's nice to know somebody out there looks forward to talking to you every day."

At least the physical part that involves me, that is. I'm happy to please my partner - it just doesn't do anything for my own lizard brain.

But I love all the other stuff that comes with being with another person, though. Make-outs, cuddles, intimacy, vulnerability all the good shit. Who I am: Big and tall, bearded, brown, geek-lite, kind of a square, curious about the world, a phenomenal listener. I love the arts (photography is my current jam), I love space, I love film/tv, I love technology, I love lamp. I wish I knew more about cool new music, but my tastes live and die in the 60s - early 00s. I do love Lizzo, though. I'm seperated and I have a young kid. Who you are: You know or want to know the city well (I don't), you know about interesting events and want some company, you're not looking for a life partner in me. I don't care if you're poly/non-monog. I tend to be attracted to artsy, socially conscious, lefty weirdos. Any questions? Slide into my DMs (that's what the kids say, right?) Love &amp; Peace "

Do you think love is more important than money and status? Are you at least somewhat of a hopeless romantic? If this sounds like you, then I would love to meet you! So, a little about me. Im 30 years old. Dad to a wonderful albeit a little crazy 3 year old (who lives with her mom). I work in software engineering education and I really enjoy what I do. Ive worked in different fields in different countries and have had really awesome and eclectic experiences including delivering statements in international fora. Im very left leaning politically and I enjoy reading a lot of fiction and non-fiction. I love to watch and play soccer and Ive been trying to incorporate it more in my life. Physically, Im 6ft tall and in decent shape. Light brown skin and darkish brown eyes and a light beard. What I hope to get: I want to have that real connection with someone where we share anything from the silliest of thoughts to those that move mountains. To be in a relationship with someone we hype each other up and push each other to grow. To be with someone thats not afraid to show love or vulnerability(yeah its a tough world out there and I understand why people are not more vulnerable but you never really know someone until theyve been vulnerable)."

Im looking for a genuine connection built on vulnerability and communication. Im looking for someone who sees everyone as more than the sum of their parts and supports personal growth. Someone who likes to chill doing nothing, watching YouTube or Netflix together while VC on discord, talking about random stuff and doesn't mind the occasional fart. It's not what we do, but all about who we do it with. I am a bit worse for wear. I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety and c-ptsd. I do treat my issues and consciously keep them compartmentalize. I will also say that while these dinks and dents can be burdensome, they taught me to be more of a compassionate empathetic person. I like supporting the people I care about. I dont get romantically attached, but I am extremely affectionate and sincere. I like indie games and comic books, more so because they uses fantastical elements to explore themes of human nature: - I appreciate that Darth Vader was saved by his son because Luke did the opposite of his father: He rejected Yoda's teachings and chose to unapologetically love his family over the Jedi Code. - I appreciate that Spider-man is about how anyone can be Spider-man, that anyone is capable of greatness. - I appreciate that the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are about broken individuals who make horrible choices who then created a family of broken individuals who learn to make decent choices together.

209,vulnerability,r4r,36 [M4F] Philadelphia Burbs/Online - An atypical hello,1,dobpwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/dobpwp/36_m4f_philadelphia_burbsonline_an_atypical_hello/,2019-10-29 04:05:05,"In a recent AskReddit thread, someone asked, ""what are questions we can ask to get to know someone better?"" One of the top voted answers was, ""What's your favorite childhood memory?"" So I started digging. For a while, I was sad, because I couldn't think of any ""favorite"" childhood memories. All I could remember was the pressure to perform. Between perfect grades and multitudes of private tutelage, living under the expectation of future greatness seemed so depressing to feel deprived of a childhood. Then one memory surfaced. Just one. My favorite memory as a child wasn't marked by a singular moment, but by a series of moments. Each day, I would gain the freedom to go out and play after my studies were completed. This would be an artifact of living under the strict tutelage of Asian, tiger parents, who were unwilling to allow me to be anything but their version their best. So these moments, were truly freeing. I would swim in the naivete of aimless exploration, lacking any goal, lacking any competition, lacking any judgement. In this aimlessness, I would ride my bike and violently push the pedals with every ounce of my being. Each push would continually gain me speed, till I would reach, what 8 year old legs could muster as terminal velocity. My bike and I, as one unit would head towards a 3-inch sidewalk-ramp created by the roots of the aging, neighboring tree. With such speed, the scent of the fresh summer rain would sizzle off the hot sidewalks into my face, creating a cacophony of summer bliss. Then I would hit the ramp. As quickly as it came, it would quickly pass by, but in my imagination, I soared across hundreds of feet of people and vehicles below. These days were the most precious because they were free of any preoccupation. Just pure innocence and fun. What a whimsical time it was, and hopefully becomes. We ask each other, ""what music do you listen to?"", ""What do you do?"", ""Where are you from?"", ""What are you interested in?"", and in each answer, we construct an ideation of our respective identities and perhaps a fantasy of how we might fit into each other's lives, and how life may be different if we allow for this connection to turn into true vulnerability. Yet we put up our guards and we tread slowly in order not to appear too hasty or not to invite the sharp, cutting pain of rejection. In my exterior, I invite wholesome, vanilla, boring fun, but you may be surprised over time. With my intellect, I challenge with a hoard of knowledge, yet remain wildly ignorant of what pop culture, typically worships. In my expression, I construct with words, and capture the beautiful world with photography (occasionally). I may not seem like an artist, as my day job is an engineer, yet the souls that magnetize me seem to be the highly intellectual or the highly artistic. Subversive themes fascinate me and the workings of the predictably, irrational minds captivate my attention. Sometimes, exploring this via deplorable, trolling ways is my modus operandi, but generally, I like to keep the verbal volley cultured and cultivated with generous seasonings of the f bomb. If these harmonics reverberate, and you're down for a pretty typical, ""hi wyd?"" and would enjoy receiving dumps of vapid memes that you have likely already seen on Reddit, intertwined with asks for the deeper meanings of life, while I juggle 4 different threads of heterogeneous topics at you, I think we have some potential. I'm not always that intense though. TLDR; Desiring to engage in 1 or more of the following together: Reading, Deep Intellectual/Emotional Talking, Fine Dining, Cheap Dining, Creating, Destroying, Exploring, Working, 420ing, Psychedelicing (very rarely), Loving, Cuddling, Hugging, Caressing, Watching, Optimizing and many other -ings.

219,vulnerability,r4r,19 [M4F] FL/Anywhere - looking for a relationship with a bdsm aspect.,2,d7k5tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/d7k5tq/19_m4f_flanywhere_looking_for_a_relationship_with/,2019-09-22 11:56:24,"Hi. Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 19 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not a little/sub, but rather my little/sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"
220,vulnerability,r4r,33[M4F] - Las Vegas / Rise Festival / Anywhere - I can't bring only half of me to today.,4,d7p2bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/d7p2bx/33m4f_las_vegas_rise_festival_anywhere_i_cant/,2019-09-22 21:13:33,"I've heard it on park benches and sweat drench bed sheets. The confused voice that doesn't understand how to process what happened and still wants to run before the truth seeps into your pores and the memory can't be forgotten. ""I'm ruined"" gets whispered in hushed voices as we search for more contact with each other in that moment of vulnerability. Fingers find fingers and lips find foreheads in moments like these. I can't help it. I can't bring only half of me to today. Which means that in this moment you get all of me. I'll tell you about growing cotton on my apartment balcony in a state where it shouldn't grow at all. Or tell you about how I helped the FBI catch a pedophile at 15. But those are just the details to keep you interested. I can't not bring the gentle touches of finger tips that remind you that you're alive. The brush against your hair line or the hand on the small of your back that silences every doubt of this moment. The good morning kiss that turns into hands all over your body as you push me away because you know that if you don't this could turn into 3 hours of your body responding to my touch and my voice and you'll end up so vulnerable and broken that you'll feel like the most beautiful piece of washed up sea glass. And I can't help telling you the truth when I see it. I sometimes wonder if men are afraid they'll run out of nice things to say about someone so they hold it all in. I think it's more like a muscle that needs to be used. I'll notice the way the wind plays with your hair and makes me a little jealous. Or the way, when you walk, your hips move with a perfect rhythm that must have been designed by a master clock maker. And if not that, then at least someone who understands perfection. And I won't hesitate to tell you that you're beautiful. But not in that superficial way that men do when they try to take your pants off. I mean in that way that connects your curves and edges with the universe as if body is the canvas that holds the night stars. \--------- So, I'm happy to chat with anyone from anywhere. However, I'll be in Vegas for the Rise Festival (where 20,000 lanterns are released over the Mojave Desert). I'll be there from the 4th - 6th and do I have a spare ticket for Saturday. My current plan is to assume that this doesn't find anyone and I'll just find someone to go with while in Vegas. It'd make for a better story anyway, and I've done the business traveler in town for a couple days super romantic and intense relationship that disappears as soon as they leave thing before. It's kinda fun."
221,vulnerability,r4r,25 [M4F] Anywhere - Seeking the seven-leaf clover version of a partner.,1,d8j8oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/d8j8oo/25_m4f_anywhere_seeking_the_sevenleaf_clover/,2019-09-24 16:23:00,"I desire love, not unlike most of the world's population. However, I believe that self-love is the key to finding an everlasting happiness. Only when you know your own heart, can you truly dedicate it to someone else. So, about myself: - I'm a 25 year old single father with a child on the ASD Spectrum. - I am currently going for my Master's degree in Psychology to become a Marriage and Family Therapist. - I would consider myself a curious intellectual; I find myself fascinated by the world, but by no means an expert. - I lean left, politically (but not extreme). - I'm very open-minded and accepting of others. - I'm a firm believer in the practice of self-care and constructive introspection. - I'm a spiritual person (not an atheist nor agnostic) with my own connection and meaning in the world. - I find comfort and passion in artistic expression (art, music, film, books, etc.). I have so many interests that it's impossible to list all of them. We'll have more things to talk about/learn from each other.  - I'm an introvert with a genuine interest in knowing others. - I've struggled with mental illness for most of my life, but I would say I'm in the recovery stage now. What I truly seek is a deep mental and emotional connection with the possibility for mutual growth. I desire a relationship where we understand that nothing in life is ""black and white"" or always ""50/50"". A concept where pride and arrogance can be cast aside in favor of vulnerability and compromise. I want to bring out the best in each other through dedication and support. Distance isn't an issue for me at all, but if you're in the US/Canada timezones, that would be ideal. I'm in PST. I'm definitely open to traveling/visiting eventually. If this post tugged at your heartstrings in any sense, introduce yourself. There's hardly much to lose and much more to possibly gain. If not, I wish you well on your journey and thank you for taking the time to read this. If you feel like we'd be good friends, also send a message and let me know. Platonic relationships can be just as fulfilling as romantic ones. I might be falling asleep soon (trying to get into a better sleeping habit) so if I don't get to any replies tonight, I will tomorrow. Have a good night/day!"
222,vulnerability,r4r,24 [M4F] Dallas-Fort Worth/ Anywhere - Tired of the small talk. Looking for something maybe a bit more direct?,0,da30eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/da30eo/24_m4f_dallasfort_worth_anywhere_tired_of_the/,2019-09-28 02:40:41,"Well, it's about time for that infrequent /r4r/ post again. I sparingly post here in hopes of finding something a bit more lasting or stable, generally get good responses and make a few friends, but rarely attain my original goals in posting. Hello, My name is Will and I hope today you'll find this post interesting enough to slot an orange envelope my way. I'm a little strange when it comes to relationships and personality. People often talk about being born in the wrong time, but I genuinely feel like I was. I desire a romantic style relationship that's based on mutual dedication and complete honesty. What does that really mean, in practice? You might be asking. I want someone that is as dedicated to me as I am to them. I want to be able to be completely honest with someone, and feel comfortable in sharing that vulnerability with them. When I mess up or when you mess up, no one freaks out or gets angry, but instead there is a discussion. This is a level of intimacy that I wish one day to have with someone else. This means, of course, that there does have to be a spark for the relationship, and generally this is established in small talk or for superficial reasons (not saying that is, necessarily, a bad thing just calling it what it is). People today date for these kinds of reasons; ""They like X music or TV show or Movie, and I do too, so we must be a good match"" or ""She's got XYZ measurements"", there are many examples of this. I think values are more important. Core values, who you are on a basic level, what matters to you. So I'm going to tell you my core values now. 1. I'm very introspective, though that can come at a much latter time. I believe being honest with your own self assessment is important, and that you should always be working towards being a better version of who you are. Does this mean I have a ton of confidence? No, not necessarily, but it means I gain it pretty quickly in most situations. 2. Honesty is really important. I won't lie to you, and I've struggled with it in the past, but I had a bit of an epiphany about six years ago and haven't lied since. I always tell the truth, no matter what. Sometimes that results in some sour interactions, but I tell people what they should hear, not what I think they want to hear. 3. Family is important. I lost my mother to breast cancer a little over a year ago. Before this, I really didn't quite think a lot about my family, but now I do. This means I'm unlikely to want to move super far away from my father or sisters, they're really all I have left. In addition to this, I'm pretty sure I'd like to have a family of my own one day, kids included. That's a while down the road, but it's definitely on the docket for a long term relationship. 4. Things like politics, religion, and morals are important, but they don't need to be the exact same as long as there is mutual respect. I am politically center-right, but that's changed many times over the years. I believe in individuality and social responsibility. I think it's important to take care of your fellow countrymen and generally am pretty open to other people's opinions. I don't like heated debates on those subjects, frequently they result in talking past one another and arguing against strawmen, so I avoid them with most people. Deist at best describes me when it comes to religion, raised Methodist but I don't go to church. 5. Money is important, people are more important. I make an ok amount of money and aim to have a pretty comfortable life, but people are more important to me than money. I think materialism is disgusting and I try to keep my life pretty minimalist. I would prefer if your stance on this is similar, if your measure of success is a car or house or other things like this, I won't be interested. While I think small talk is tiring and a poor basis for your relationships, I think it might give you some pointers on the kind of person I am, so here goes the small talk rapid-fire: * I listen to a wide variety of music, from old western country to classical to metal to jazz. I have a soft spot for Russian composers, Rachmaninoff is my favorite. I play the guitar (somewhat) and the drums (quite a bit more), I played jazz drums in college. * I think a lot of modern media is lost on me. I enjoyed GoT at the start, maybe the first two seasons, but the last three have been abysmal writing when compared to the beginning. My favorite TV show is Breaking Bad and I think I've watched it through four or five times. My favorite movie is pretty specific, The Grand Illusion, if you know it I'd love to talk about it. * My favorite book is *A Farewell to Arms* by Hemingway, he's also my favorite author. I'll commit social suicide and say I dislike the Harry Potter series, and genuinely don't mesh well with people who are avid fans of the series. Sorry, that's just my opinion. I've watched the movies, they're alright, but I didn't enjoy reading the novels. Shoot me * I am an amateur blacksmith, it's something I've been doing for a long time and it's one of my favorite pastimes. * I play a few online games, Classic WoW as of late, but I've also played League on and off for a few years. My favorite games tend to be singleplayer games, Bioshock tops the list but Dead Space is a close second. * I watch, read, and study history in my free time. I have a Military History degree, and it's something I enjoy learning about. If you looked at my youtube subscriptions, it's a lot of educational content geared towards this, so be prepared for it. * I am Caucasian, 6'0"", about 240 pounds and currently losing more every day. [There's a picture of my face](URL . Looks aren't super important to me, but they are for other people, so I'll leave you to decide if I'm up to par. Well, that's all I've really got. I'm looking for someone close preferably, but if you're farther away I'm not opposed to a LDR for a little while at least. I've done them before and I know how to act in them. I'm not particular about age, race, hair color, weight, or anything else like that, I care most about your personality and who you are in your day to day life. If you've read all of this and you've decided to send me a message, thank you. If you've decided the opposite but have read it all anyway, thank you for giving my post some of your time. Here's to hoping we all find someone, right?"

We date separately, we are not looking for unicorns. If you have any questions about poly or our relationship, please feel free to reach out and ask, but do not judge. It works for us. It isn't for everyone. If you are monogamous, this post is not for you.*** With that out of the way, hello! I never really know how to start these posts off, or whether I should keep them short and funny or long and detailed. I'm going with long and detailed today, so bear with me. I'm 34 years old, living in the suburbs of Illinois, 40 minutes or so west of Chicago. I've been living here for the last 4 years, working in tech and generally enjoying my life here. I met my girlfriend almost a year ago and we've been happily together since then. We currently do not live together but are planning on doing so in the near future. I've lived in Pakistan, Paris, Nevada, WA, NY state and now Illinois in my life, so one might say I've been around the block. I love to travel and there is a potential for me moving to Providence, RI in the near future. Not decided yet. Where were we? Oh, yes. Travel. I know how everyone on their dating profile states how much they love to travel. Well, I genuinely love to travel. I love visiting new places, people, experiences, food, culture. You name it. I'm a dork, a geek, a nerd. But I feel like everyone on reddit is a bit nerdy nowadays anyway. What does my nerdiness consist of? Anything ranging from comic books, to table top games, to board games, fantasy/sci-fi novels, computer games and science! I love it all. If you're into that stuff, I'd love to discuss it. Some favorite authors: Neil Gaiman, Brandon Sanderson, Stephen King. I love to cook, I love to eat (as you will see in my photos), I am 420 friendly, I swing extremely to the left when it comes to politics. Bernie and Warren 2020. Yang has some positives too. What am I looking for? I have a girlfriend, shouldn't that be enough, you ask. Eh, poly doesn't work that way. I am open to an emotional and physical long term relationship. I would like to form connections of intimacy, vulnerability, honesty and empathy. I put an extremely high value on good communication (it is essential for successful relationships, extremely so if you are poly) and kindness. I'm open to long distance with the caveat that we would meet one day if the chemistry is mutual. I'm looking for someone that recharges me, where I give a silly, small smile when I see they texted me, who makes me laugh and look forward to each interaction with. Someone who isn't a drain on me (introverts unite!) and who would love to share their hopes and dreams and loves with. If you are that person, what are you waiting for? Message me!

My favorite games tend to be singleplayer games, Bioshock tops the list but Dead Space is a close second. * I watch, read, and study history in my free time. I have a Military History degree, and it's something I enjoy learning about. If you looked at my youtube subscriptions, it's a lot of educational content geared towards this, so be prepared for it. * I am Caucasian, 6'0"", about 240 pounds and currently losing more every day. I'll be more than happy to drop you a picture if you ask for it. Looks aren't super important to me, but they are for other people, so I'll leave you to decide if I'm up to par. Well, that's all I've really got. I'm looking for someone close preferably, but if you're farther away I'm not opposed to a LDR for a little while at least. I've done them before and I know how to act in them. I'm not particular about age, race, hair color, weight, or anything else like that, I care most about your personality and who you are in your day to day life. If you've read all of this and you've decided to send me a message, thank you. If you've decided the opposite but have read it all anyway, thank you for giving my post some of your time. Here's to hoping we all find someone, right?"

Someone I can really click with and who's comfortable sharing their most vulnerable selves with me. I don't wanna hear about what you do but instead I wanna know how you think, what you've learned, how you feel, your mistakes, your nightmares, insecurities, wacky conspiracy theories you believe in, weird jazz you're into but are afraid of admitting, heartbreaks, childhood traumas you haven't gotten past. Let's connect the dots and heal then laugh. For a long time I was prideful about sharing my vulnerability and tbh still kinda am but it's a learning process  let's learn together or teach me!

I posted in the relevant city subreddit for r4r as well. Thank you.) I'm a rather reserved, introverted woman and I like to keep it that way. However, for reasons unnecessary to mention, I am very adverse to bring vulnerable in any sense of intimacysexually, romantically, emotionally. I'm looking for someone to go on this adventure with me; I'm a black woman, bbw, with glasses and short, dark brown hair. 5'6. No sexual diseases and want to keep it that way. Reader, tea drunker and trail explorer; I love nature and sleeping (who doesn't like to sleep?) You are: 30 at minimum (45 at maximum), well spoken and eclectic. Strange, weird, the good kind. White male, introverted (preferred but not needed) and intelligent. Likes reading and trails as well. In a way, I'm seeking a fwb that's closer and more intimate but I'm not looking to date. If this sounds like something that intrigues you, feel free to message me. Please keep in mind that I'm looking for local people and I can't host (roommates) when sending a message.

Im also a master, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet.

M/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a master and his Slave. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a Slave. Not a Slave, but rather my Slave. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement.

Its [James](URL Im a passionate person about a lot of things. I dont like staying in one imaginative cubicle, so Im continually trying new things and my life has been a vast of many experiences that ranges randomly. I loved photography, but I dont do it much anymore despite spending a good chunk of my life as a photographer. Id like to say its a tool Im putting away for future use, as Id like to travel and explore the world beyond the one Ive always known as America. Im currently pursuing my major in Accounting, because apparently Im one of few that find this idea appealing. Growing up pseudo homeschooled I hated math and have always struggled with it. I dropped out before I finished high school because I wanted to do something better with my time. Thankfully, it didnt make so much of an impact in my ability to get into college. Its indeed strange that I picked this major, as a younger myself wouldve thought this is a purely insane idea. But here we are! I used to be an avid motorcyclist as well, I enjoyed spending a lot of my time riding along the coast in my county in Southern California. I plan to get one again as soon as I land my first internship as a reward! As dangerous that sounds, I live to embrace the risks in life as its very rewarding for me. Id like to do cross country riding some day! Im a huge book worm, as Ive never really adhered to my education growing up. I was your modern Tom Sawyer, my daily lessons in my textbook was like whitewashing the fence, it had to be done before I was allowed to go out and have fun! As much as I enjoyed being outdoor, I also spent good portions of my childhood cooped up in my homemade fort in my double stacked twin beds, reading and reading. It was like a legitimate drug that allowed me disassociate from the world into other worlds, because as Jake put it in Dark Tower, Go on then, there are other worlds than these. That has stuck with me through many years and to this day, Im still to be found hiding in my little room, nose buried in turning pages. Lastly, to close off this post, Id like to be upfront and to say Im seeking a potential partner. To list things that Id like to see in my partner is beyond cliche, as Id like to think. Life is a gamble, you take your chances. Id only expect that our interests and beliefs about life meets in the middle, because thats the way life intended. Im looking for someone whos actively working toward something that is meaningful to them that can throw us on the same road, but different lanes would be just as dandy. Most importantly, I ask for an open minded individual who would look beyond the cover of the book to see what the story is, but more importantly that they would gladly contribute to it. I hope that some way the force would bring us together, if not some silly internet novel that you happen to scroll past. Footnote: (as to imply that this isnt the part I normally add to my introduction as it puts off, but deemed necessary in my experience, for my own sake). Ive learned that from my insights of my past experience in real life that Ive too often been turned down before there was even a chance due to my looks, and too often I get led on, so I say lets get the elephant out of the room so to speak, before there are misguided chemistry. I was born with a neurological disorder called Sturge Weber Syndrome. Its not contagious, I assure you. As you can see, I do fine by my cognitive ability to see the glass half full. I still struggle sometimes with being self conscious about it especially if Im being turned down immediately because there are no physical attraction. It happens to be because Im naturally susceptible to the ugly effect of vulnerability shame, as any human being is. Im also profoundly deaf, though I dont consider myself one or all in the both sounding world and the silent one. I have what I consider a balance brought together through my circumstances where Im able to be comfortably in both."

I want to be stupid and say that thing I shouldn't say because it makes me feel something. I feel nothing most of the time but when I do those things, I feel great. I want to live my life to the fullest, I want to be vulnerable and share so many things and yes.. I also want to be very weird and say all the things we normally don't say. We are scared of being judged and end up not saying a word. I want to be judged for all the things I do. Yes, I obsess when I have good reasons, I will tell you that ice cream is not gelato, I will tell you that once upon a time in hollywood is a trash movie. I will also tell you to be vulnerable with me and not to be scared of sharing those things no one knows about you. With me, you can do all those things. If you think that's impossible, try. It's all about trying. I want intimate phone calls with full of vulnerability. I also want to flirt if we both want it. I'm very simple but also very complicated and weird. I'm brutally honest but that doesn't mean I will hurt you with my words. I like going to cafes, reading, nature, traveling, movies and so much more but that doesn't matter. We don't have to have a lot in common. Hell, we don't have to have anything in common. Be vulnerable with me, that's all I want. Maybe I want you to consume me, make me feel scared. Surprise me with your thoughts. I care about having a connection and sharing things. I'm a bit tipsy but I hope that's alright."

You dont need to tell me you are dominant, masculine, and a gentleman for me to know it. You seduce with your confidence, your smile, your words, your eyes, and especially your patience.

And she will be wholly devoted to you, and only you because you saw to her comfort first. And now she will see to yours as you enter a completely symbiotic relationship. I am a woman who enjoys seducing you with my confidence, my strength, my laughter, and my pure joy at being female. I want to trade banter with you, I want to get butterflies in your presence, I want to figure out what your favorite dish is so I can make it on our second date. Turn on my mind, and you will turn my body on. Touch me in all the non-physical ways. Give me intellectual Os in multiples and allow temptation to drip from my ears. Devour my thoughts and taste my perception. Learn my soul and I will fill the void of your filthiest imaginations. Never start with your hands, your d***, a sexual picture or text. Use your mind, and you WILL have me. And then, after some time where we have established trust and where neither of us can stop thinking about each other, I want to give you more...my body, my submission, my vulnerability, my secrets, and my fears. I will trust you to hold on to them. I will trust you to know when I need to be held or cuddled, I will trust you to know when I need to be put over your knee, I will trust you to pick out an outfit for me to go out for a night on the town, I will trust you to share with me EVERYTHING: mental, physical, emotional. Both of us will be exposed. Sexy is not sending a sext message within the first couple days of knowing someone. Sexy is not meeting up for the first time and expecting a blowjob. Sexy is not expecting instant submission. Sexy is getting to know what a person loves (Art? Museums? Good food?) and using it to seduce them. Sexy is paying attention to her favorite color and wearing it on your second date. Sexy is taking the time to talk to each other, to get to know aspirations, hopes, and what pursuits make our blood sing. Sexy is listening and knowing when to push and when to back down. Intimacy is earned. Dont you want to earn something? To taste how sweet it is after the work you put in? Like lemonade after working in the yard under a hot sun  it tastes all the sweeter, doesnt it? Where most people throw around their bodies first, I want words, experiences, intellectual discussion, and emotional insight first. Where the above is concerned, I WILL put my money where my mouth is. The work isnt just one-sided. You earn, I earnin the end, we both get more than we could have asked for..."

And I'd ideally like a consistent and longterm friendship and not just a one or two day thing. That being said, my girlfriend was pretty much my only friend who was also a woman. I have guy friends, and I've actually made a couple new guy friends through this sub which is great, but I'm definitely missing the sense of vulnerability(?) and openness that comes much more naturally to me when speaking with women. I don't wanna go too much into stuff about me in the post here since it'd be nice to actually talk about it one on one, but there are a few things that might be worth mentioning, \- I'm super into music of all kinds, especially rare/underappreciated music from other times and other countries. It's insane to me how much amazing music with so much emotion has sorta just gotten swept under the rug for so many different reasons, especially when the artist's home country had a very strict government which didn't allow them to spread their music outside of where they lived. I would love to show you some of this stuff and see what you think of it, if that's something you're interested in \- I also make music, which is luckily my job, but we could get into that privately if you wanted. But this doesn't mean that I'm looking for other people who make music or even appreciate music, I'm arguably even more interested in hearing perspectives that aren't like my own! \- I play a few video games but not very often, I like to watch shows and movies more than play games lately. Specifically breaking bad, better call saul(which i'm currently in the middle of) and other similar shows/movies. Mystery/Thriller films are my absolute favorite and I have plenty to recommend &amp;#x200B; If you're interested, please be over 18 and under 30.

The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one. The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. To quote the studys authors, One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure. Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue. I JUST read a psychology article on this and thought it was absolutely awesome. Would love to try it out with YOU, for research purposes of course ;) Theres 36 questions, so lets do 3 at a time! 1. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want as a dinner guest? 2. Would you like to be famous? In what way? 3. Before making a telephone call, do you ever rehearse what you are going to say? Why?"

(Japanese) \- Man with heavy Slavic accent bud \- Man with British accent who narrates things bud \- ??? (Open to platonic suggestions) I am a person interested in other people and looking for human connection and intimacy (pls not sexually). I like classic/contemporary classic literature, comedy, being silly, blathering about ""what things mean,"" like, um, stuff, and like, literally, things (cooking/baking, camping, MtG/Hearthstone \*disclaimer: am not good or that involved\*, dog watching, time permitting \*disclaimer: time! ouch, tend to be busy\*). I am not picky but particular, and like indie music and television for people with poor taste. More recently preferring white wine. On a scale of friendliness I range from a 3-9. On a scale of body odor I would say 1 (you will have to guess the orientation of this scale). On a visual analogue scale (VAS) of reliability I would say 67, depending on the person.

All contained within this fleshy vessel (background non-intentional, admittedly flattering): [URL As evidenced by my posting of a recognizable and potentially embarrassing photograph on the internet, I appreciate openness and authenticity (especially in the setting of thoughtfulness). Think too much ""weirdness"" is assigned to normal behavior --&gt; isolation +/- emptiness or egoism. Ultimately, meeting people this way is interesting because it casts a wider net on different personalities. It is interesting to think, when you're sitting in a room, that all the people around you have stories you will likely never know. It's also interesting that everything we'll share in a tangible space is filtered first through me and then through the lens of your perspective/experience, and how that warps or dissipates or influences truth. Social relationships in general are interesting, the push and pull of power and the wax and wane of vulnerability. To be less sentimental/gross, there are some days I spend almost entirely on the computer (not for the purposes of fun), and it'd just be nice to have friends to break up the day. Would appreciate a good laugh, though patience may be a requirement, for as I mentioned I can get tied up w/ professional activities. However you feel about it, my MBTI is INFJ. If you've made it this far, please mention an egg or something in your message/comment. I would appreciate it. Thanks for reading! please be kind :-)"

I want to bare my soul to you,0,cz54lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/cz54lq/21f4r_anywhere_i_want_to_bare_my_soul_to_you/,2019-09-03 23:49:53,"First, for context, check this out [URL As someone who has always looked down upon vulnerability, I want to really know if it makes a significant difference to ""living"". I don't know when I started building walls around me. I probably even have a moat around them (No, I have never been hurt by anyone. I have never given anyone the chance). I have a pretty loving family and friends. But no one knows the whole truth about me. 95% yes, but nowhere near complete. Not all of me. There are obviously things I am not proud of doing but I would do them again given the same circumstances. I do not like regrets and maybe that feeds into me being closed off. I am pretty extroverted and excel in the art of making friends. People seem to think that they really know me because of that. And, over the years, keeping some chunks of me to myself has become extremely easy (maybe keeping a part of you to yourself is a good thing. I am not disputing that). The point is I only gave thought to the issue of vulnerability after listening to that video and I want to see if it is all it seems cut out to be. I am an ENTP. A Leo (I don't believe in Astrology but I find that most of the personality traits ring true for me). I am both book smart (the whole honor roll student gig, topped the graduating class majoring in Comp Sci) and street smart (result of the environment in which I grew up). I am physically and mentally fit. Since, this isn't about finding common ground but being completely vulnerable to each other, we can talk about our interests later on. What exactly am I looking for? I want someone who can commit six months to knowing a stranger. When I say commit, I mean sticking it out, whichever way the road leads. I want someone who is willing to lay their feelings/existence bare. If you judge me on something I say, I want to know about it (and you should also be able to take judgement) \[Include a color in the subject\]If you feel my late responses hurt you, you tell me. I want you to hide nothing from me. I will do the same of course. All of this is assuming that you can hold conversations. Obviously there are some deal breakers : No racists, homophobes, xenophobes, anti-vaxxers, anti-abortionists, smokers, or far right people. Also, I would like you to be in a good place mentally. This is about baring your soul and I do not want to unintentionally hurt you by triggering something. About this turning into something romantic : That is NOT the goal. I would want to hear from women too. However, if it comes to that, it should be worth exploring. I am single and straight. Physically 5'4'' and athletic. If you are hoping that this might turn into something romantic, then of course physical attraction is important. Since I intend this entire exchange to be anonymous (whaaaat? I will explain), I will give you a general idea of my ""type"", having dated around a bit - be fit (health should be important to you) and taller than me in heels (so over 5'8'') About anonymity: I intend to get into a political career in the near future. Also, I have a very unique full name. One google search and you can find more mentions of me than I would like you to. But then, what is the point of this exercise? This is the internet. Having taught a course in cybersecurity, I have good reason to be wary of it. In any case, this isn't about the factual details, it is about stuff much much deeper than that. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of anonymity, please don't respond. Also, I would like you to be below 30 ideally, but I don't really care because you could very well be 60 and tell me you are 20. However, I would hope that no one would want to drain six months pretending to be who they are not. If you do, then again, I won't be the one at a loss. I would like to use discord during the duration of our vulnerability experiment. I am not sure how many people would respond to this. If it ends up being one, I would go with that person. In any case, tell me about yourself in a couple of lines and more importantly, tell me why you are in the best place to take on something like this. I want you to be as excited as I am about this! Please do take time to think it over, considering your prior commitments, I would hate it if you decide to give up midway. Once you are on the roller coaster with me, it only stops after 6 months. I hope I don't change my mind about this before I find someone xD."

Are you out there? If you are, Id love to meet you. I dont have trouble meeting men. I dont have trouble getting them to say some wonderful things about me. For the most part, theyve all been kind, amazing people. But, still, I feel empty inside. Its hard to find someone that sees me. Sometimes I feel like Im the only one who thinks the way I think, who lives the way I live, who strives for the same things I strive for. And sometimes, I find those kindred spirits, but their hearts are elsewhere. Their minds are consumed by the struggles of life. Their souls are already occupied. I understand that, but still, I feel alone. My desires are strange, and maybe a bit needy. I consider myself an independent individual, but having someone do things for me warms my heart. A mug of tea when Im stressed, a foot rub after a long day, waking up to breakfast  all things Im more than capable of doing myself, but things that make me feel loved and cared for when theyre done by others. I just want to feel cherished. Its been a while since Ive laughed. Like, *really* laughed. Its been ten months, to be exact. I miss that. Its been a while since I had someone to banter with. Someone who not only understood my quips, but could swing them right back at me. Its been a while since Ive had an orgasm during sex. Its been ten months, to be exact. I guess Im a shy gal. I require just the right environment: nurturing, sexy, encouraging, naughty. By myself, its easy to achieve. But with a partner? Quite difficult. Its been a while since Ive felt valued for more than sex. Its been ten months, to be exact. Its my own insecurity. I take responsibility for it. I love sex. I love being sexual. But I need the affection coupled with it. Fuck my mouth until I cant breathe. Make me squirt until I cry. But kiss me in between. Love me in between. Show me that I am more than just a gorgeous body. Make me believe it. Its been a while since Ive shared my weaknesses, insecurities, and fears. Since I binge-watched a show with someone. Since I had someone to call when I had great news. Since I felt supported and empowered to follow my dreams. Im hoping for you. Im looking for a long-term commitment, but one that is non-monogamous. Im hoping for someone who is self-aware, not afraid of a challenge, not afraid of challenging what is wrong in the world, in themselves, in us. Im looking for the person who creates a world that suits them. Im looking to be on someones list of priorities. Im looking to have someone on my own list. Im looking for someone who is as addicted to vulnerability and connections as I am. Is it you? Be honest with yourself. Be honest with me. If its you, lets chat. Realistic Logistics: Locals only. Any age (over 18) welcome. Any race welcome. I prefer someone who cares a bit about their body. Skinny, lanky, with some hidden strength often does it for me, but I also love a good dad bod.

I could analyze literally anything tbh and find it fascinating, there's always something to learn from anything. I'm a scientist at heart. I've been told I can come off really coldly at times, being so detached and logical. It's probably because deep down I'm actually really sensitive. There's times where analysis is required, and times where feelings are suitable, I suppose my line for it is much more clear cut than most. But, I never forget the value of empathy I have for those I care about, it is THE thing I value most in relationships. I am wary of the potential in getting attached to ideologies which is very likely the reason I do so cautiously, and rather find interest in understanding them and analyzing how people think/behave towards such things. This would include things like politics, culture, morality, consumerism, and a lot of media in general. I also find it really hard to find a pull towards such things like culture or political groups or anything like that, it's all the same, really. So much of it seems so pointless. Everyone, including myself, succumbs to the bias that comes with where you happened to be born, what language you happened to learn, what nationality your family is, what time period you're in, and how much of the internet you've been exposed to. We're ultimately products of our environment to a very high degree. I strive to fight this and attain as much ""freedom"" as I possibly can by as much of an unbiased and scientific understanding of things as possible. Like I get it, the point of culture, gives you common ground, an identity, something to always go back to and feel a part of, like I said, I like to understand it. But I don't feel a pull to it. Perhaps it's elitism, perhaps I'm being too logical. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. I'm extremely emotionally intelligent, as well as overall intelligent. I'm creative. I hold essentially all of my emotional energy for those I care about, which are currently a couple friends and my sister. I believe most of society is vapid and pointless to care about. An individual person isn't going to inflict any change alone. It's best to focus on your own selfish desires above all, as much as you have control over, at least. This probably sounds pretty realistic right? But really I'm quite idealistic when it comes to the few things I do care about, which is scientific advancement and relationships. I'm going to be a researcher in some science field, I can't stand corporate vapidness. Things that are actually interesting and I can make an impact on. The family I'd like to make, surrounded by friends who see past the silliness that most of society is. I like to live in my own little world a lot of the time, but I make it happen too. I've been searching for ideal friendships and have found some, even though it took a long time. Next is a romantic relationship, although I do have a couple years experience with this, so I know what I'm looking for. I've always been fond of friendships/relationships where typical shallow thinking and pointlessly conditioned behaviors aren't present. I've always liked to be real with people, I don't like small talk. I like to get deep. I'm extremely empathetic, I can understand people really well. But I only care about a select few. There's only so much energy that I have, can't be bothered with most people. I'm chaotic neutral as far as alignments go, just found out about that one. I tend to dislike personality tests and the like, but that description is scarily accurate. So what am I looking for? I'm looking for someone like me. Someone who's also interested in a second half, a partner in crime, devoting ourselves to each other entirely. Fully emotionally secure. Sharing our thoughts and feelings with each other fully knowing and accepting the vulnerability between us. Someone who is intelligent enough to be my equal. I can't control what I'm stimulated by, and it seems intelligence is the number 1 factor. I know this will get the iamverysmart eyeroll to many reading this but it's hard finding people as smart as me. I don't say that lightly, I am self aware enough to understand the common emotionally driven shortcomings of ""intelligent"" people and strive against it. In the end my intelligence was complete luck, I just got ""lucky"" in this regard. Born with it. It would be silly to be prideful about that. Instead I take pride in things I have control over, things that take effort. Like staying open-minded, keeping intellectual humility a priority, and improving upon the mistakes I make. I'm very much a believer of growth mindset. Same for divergent thinking. Complacency is detestable. Unfortunately it's quite hard to find people who can both stimulate me and be considerable for a relationship. The amount of times someone is brilliant, yet completely emotionally unintelligent is way too high. I feel like an anomaly really, with how well rounded I am. I have endless topics to discuss, if we are interested in the same things like talking about yourself, myself, people in general, thinking, and life. I enjoy mathematics, neuroscience, philosophy, and cognitive science as a whole. Documentaries, books, cooking, and video games. I love to listen as much as I love to talk. I'm very far from a one-word responder, and if we click, we'll likely end up with several hour conversations, a common occurrence with people I've met on here, however, rarely up to my standards, so it doesn't last. Did meet my best friend on reddit about 2.5 years ago though, so my hopes are up! If I sound interesting, hit me with a pm with a bit about yourself or something you found interesting from my post, it's a great conversation starter. In any case, good luck!"

My hands touched you in just the right places for just the right amount of time. It wasn't rushed and hurried like most men. It wasn't in search of the places most men go when their fingers roam. My fingers against your lips sent reminded you of connectivity and chemistry and butterflies and broken toys fixed with super glue. In the confusion of the orange glow of the evening light and the burning lust of being pressed against a wall with a man who seems to not be in a rush to take your pants off you wondered aloud, ""If I ran away right now, how would you find me?"" Do you not know that the stars were hung in the night sky so men like me could find women like you? Don't you think that Jupiter hangs so that if you were to run, I could find you? And if I get lost, I'll collect wild sage from the valley and weave it into a crown of purple clover for you to wear when I find you. Do you think that every time I touch you it is an accident? Or do you think that I'm reminding my self of the valleys you call home? Do you still want to run? I told you not to cling to this. Pretty words that distract you from the truth. Pretty words that are said at just the right time to keep you trapped. Pretty words that make you second guess your feelings and what you know to be true. And so, let me throw away the pretty words. Run whenever you like, but know that this is true. You were beautiful to me before you revealed all your secrets and insecurities. The way vulnerability dripped from your pores afraid that I would react with anything but kindness. And all those scars and shapes you can't quite define, I've fallen in love with. Cold coffee because I was listening to you talk and I didn't want to miss the way you slow down to make a point and then speed up your next three words to make up for the lost time. It's almost as if you feel like you need to make this all up to me, and you already have, my dear. You already have. Also, you should know that I don't change the sheets when you visit for you. I do it for me. I know that eventually it will be the last time and if you come when I have clean sheets, then I can keep your smell here a little longer. It's not the same as waking up to you. Or holding your hand at the state fair. Or looking into your eyes on snowy days and knowing that they don't match the white and grey at all. Maybe they were never supposed.

I feel like connections like that can only develop over time and through vulnerability and fostering intimate settings to be such. **I'm asking for someone who is willing to get there together.** I shy away from the optimistic. This is not to say I'm negative Nancy over here. It's just, hard for me to be optimistic all the time. It's exhausting and I can't relate to the perpetually positive Peters of the world.

Bonus points for specifically cognitive science or mathematics.",4,bzurhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/bzurhn/20_m4f_anywhereusa_seeking_a_deep_relationship/,2019-06-13 04:25:11,"I don't really know where to start, never really have with these. Always found formats restricting in a way. I'm going to just talk about myself. I enjoy understanding things. Yes, ""things"". I could analyze literally anything tbh and find it fascinating, there's always something to learn from anything. I'm a scientist at heart. I've been told I can come off really coldly at times, being so detached and logical. It's probably because deep down I'm actually really sensitive. There's times where analysis is required, and times where feelings are suitable, I suppose my line for it is much more clear cut than most. But, I never forget the value of empathy I have for those I care about, it is THE thing I value most in relationships. I am wary of the potential in getting attached to ideologies which is very likely the reason I do so cautiously, and rather find interest in understanding them and analyzing how people think/behave towards such things. This would include things like politics, culture, morality, consumerism, and a lot of media in general. I also find it really hard to find a pull towards such things like culture or political groups or anything like that, it's all the same, really. So much of it seems so pointless. Everyone, including myself, succumbs to the bias that comes with where you happened to be born, what language you happened to learn, what nationality your family is, what time period you're in, and how much of the internet you've been exposed to. We're ultimately products of our environment to a very high degree. I strive to fight this and attain as much ""freedom"" as I possibly can by as much of an unbiased and scientific understanding of things as possible. Like I get it, the point of culture, gives you common ground, an identity, something to always go back to and feel a part of, like I said, I like to understand it. But I don't feel a pull to it. Perhaps it's elitism, perhaps I'm being too logical. Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps. I'm extremely emotionally intelligent, as well as overall intelligent. I'm creative. I hold essentially all of my emotional energy for those I care about, which are currently a couple friends and my sister. I believe most of society is vapid and pointless to care about. An individual person isn't going to inflict any change alone. It's best to focus on your own selfish desires above all, as much as you have control over, at least. This probably sounds pretty realistic right? But really I'm quite idealistic when it comes to the few things I do care about, which is scientific advancement and relationships. I'm going to be a researcher in some science field, I can't stand corporate vapidness. Things that are actually interesting and I can make an impact on. The family I'd like to make, surrounded by friends who see past the silliness that most of society is. I like to live in my own little world a lot of the time, but I make it happen too. I've been searching for ideal friendships and have found some, even though it took a long time. Next is a romantic relationship, although I do have a couple years experience with this, so I know what I'm looking for. I've always been fond of friendships/relationships where typical shallow thinking and pointlessly conditioned behaviors aren't present. I've always liked to be real with people, I don't like small talk. I like to get deep. I'm extremely empathetic, I can understand people really well. But I only care about a select few. There's only so much energy that I have, can't be bothered with most people. I'm chaotic neutral as far as alignments go, just found out about that one. I tend to dislike personality tests and the like, but that description is scarily accurate. So what am I looking for? I'm looking for someone like me. Someone who's also interested in a second half, a partner in crime, devoting ourselves to each other entirely. Fully emotionally secure. Sharing our thoughts and feelings with each other fully knowing and accepting the vulnerability between us. Someone who is intelligent enough to be my equal. I can't control what I'm stimulated by, and it seems intelligence is the number 1 factor. I know this will get the iamverysmart eyeroll to many reading this but it's hard finding people as smart as me. I don't say that lightly, I am self aware enough to understand the common emotionally driven shortcomings of ""intelligent"" people and strive against it. In the end my intelligence was complete luck, I just got ""lucky"" in this regard. Born with it. It would be silly to be prideful about that. Instead I take pride in things I have control over, things that take effort. Like staying open-minded, keeping intellectual humility a priority, and improving upon the mistakes I make. I'm very much a believer of growth mindset. Same for divergent thinking. Complacency is detestable. Unfortunately it's quite hard to find people who can both stimulate me and be considerable for a relationship. The amount of times someone is brilliant, yet completely emotionally unintelligent is way too high. I feel like an anomaly really, with how well rounded I am.

I'm sure you're on this subreddit for a reason. Maybe it's hard to click with others around you irl for some reason, maybe life got you down recently, your ""friends"" aren't really friends, your love options have seemed vapid with ulterior motives, or perhaps there's a safety in online interaction that can't be found elsewhere. Something along these lines, I'd bet. Hoping to meet someone who just feels right. Well, I'm here for many of the same reasons. In particular for myself, it's pretty simply that I find it hard to find others who are as intelligent, empathetic, yet selfish, as I am. And yes, I said intelligence. I know this gets the iamverysmart eye roll from many, but I don't mind, as I'm sure by the end of this post I will have proven that I don't fall for such shortcomings in such people's mindsets nor that my claims of intelligence are unfounded. So yes, I will say that I am extremely overall intelligent and if you don't believe you are, then we will very likely not be a good fit. There are people who simply don't think much, don't understand much, and don't make sense of much. I see patterns everywhere, have a strong desire for self improvement and avoiding stagnation, I think a lot, and I'm very self aware. I know what I'm capable of while also being wary of what happens when someone thinks highly of themselves. But the fact of the matter is that I just can't click and be stimulated for a long period of time with the vast majority of people. I was born with this intelligence since obviously it's almost entirely genetic. I don't take pride in it. It's just something I was ""lucky"" to get. It's great in some ways, yet lonely in others. It's not that I can't find common ground with many people, it's that _stimulation_ is so hard to find with such people. That stimulation that I've only felt with a few people before is absolutely second-to-none and the most invigoratingly satisfying experience imaginable. I am, although, not looking for someone who is just intelligent in the classic sense, but also emotionally intelligent, however that may be defined. I'm sure we've all met the type who is very intelligent but also just completely socially unaware and just overall awful to be around. This, to me, is much too one-sided and not what I'm looking for. I believe emotional, or maybe ""human"" intelligence is the key here, whatever you want to call it. I am also emotionally intelligent, and finding someone as well rounded as I am has been quite the difficult task for romantic relationships, and really normal friendships as well, much to my dismay. Empathy, for example, being able to see someone else's view, understand it, and feel it on a deep level is imperative for me to build a connection. This is so different than caring about someone. Often times parents care for their children, but aren't empathetic. Most normal relationships are caring but rarely empathetic and that's a damn shame in my eyes. Empathy is hard to do, caring is very easy. But I get it, there's a lot of emotional investment in empathy. A lot of vulnerability and thought required to understand where they're coming from. That's why I restrict it to those who will actually get it, appreciate it, and are capable of returning it. I am deeply considerate and sensitive with those I care for, and continuously better and better at understanding how they think and feel as I learn more about them. It's a truly wonderful feeling. I recently learned about alignments and chaotic neutral is essentially how I am. It's pretty astonishing, really, I've seen so many of the personality tests and labels like mbti and whatnot, but no description has come closer to my essence than the one for chaotic neutral. I've noticed that I'm a bit of an odd case when it comes to empathy. I highly value empathy, but only for those I care about since I only think some people are worth it. I don't believe in any type of moral high ground for anything, society was built on norms that we are forced to follow to keep coherence. Everyone is self-serving, no matter how much they try to rationalize themselves out of that idea, imo. I take it in stride and therefore only care about myself. This also extends to those I care about as I care about them as I do myself. Very deeply, to say the least. Currently that's a couple friends and my sister. I like talking about deep and ""controversial"" topics, our desires, values, and thoughts without filter, pressing questions to get all the way down into our _core_. I do this introspectively with myself all the time as well. As I said earlier, I have a deep invigoration in self improvement and understanding myself more. I value insightful constructive criticism at all times. Intellectual humility is always worth it, too. If something I say or claim seems to be too emotionally driven without me realizing it, for example, I'd love to know when that happens. I don't think emotionally driven thinking is always bad, only when we don't realize it and try to rationalize it to fit an insecurity. But I must say I think quite rationally regularly. Divergent as well, I'm very creative in how I approach and understand things. If we get to know each other you'll come to find many of my own little concepts I've come up with to explain the world that make a lot of sense. While I am no claimer of ""original"" thought, I do things like devil's advocate and understanding things with as little bias as possible, eventually leading to my own take on things. I want to actually get to know people, but so many seem so vapid. Like most of society, really. I think many social norms are silly. Everyone does the same things, with extremely predictable behavior because it's the expected thing to do, not because they have actually explicitly thought about it on a deep level. I find people who completely concede to becoming products of their environment completely detestable, even though it often happens unknowingly, since the subtle hand of socially influencing ideologies from the cancer of media, church, and politics over decades (really of all time by the ruling class, but I digress) of ubiquitous degeneration of society for capitalist interests has been extremely successful. But still, in the end, it just shows a lack of depth and desire to think for oneself, one that I aim to oppose. I definitely think we all are simply products of our environment, including myself, to quite a large degree, but my pursuit in life constitutes estranging from such a conditioned formation as much as possible. I don't want to go to family meetups because I'm expected to. I don't want to live for my yearly vacation. I don't want to go through the same silly trials and tribulations that shortsighted people always go through. I don't want to repeat the same mistakes of my parents with their kids. I don't want to get stuck in a job I hate regardless of how much money it makes. I don't want to fall for the idea that blood family is ""oh so important"" if they add no value to my life. I don't want to drink alcohol as as a social lubricant. I don't want to fall for media and politics cancer everyday, allowing myself to be formed to the whim of media's desires. I could go on about these in so much detail that this post would become more of a book than it already is by the end of it, so I'll keep it at that for now. I want to fight this conditioning and these expectations. So much is so shallow, so empty, so lacking in _meaning_ and I will do my absolute best to carve out a more meaningful path for myself in this life. My current deduction has therefore led me to two main points. First one is that relationships on a truly deep level are the most important thing, otherwise the rest of life is meaningless. The second would be becoming a scientist of some sort, I absolutely love analyzing things and understanding them deeper, for the gist of it. So how do I actually plan to make these things become reality? Well, the first should be evident as I'm getting myself out there in many ""dating"" related areas, and this would be one of them. I actually met my best friend on reddit here about 2.5 years ago, so my hopes are particularly up for this option. Much like friendships, and starting as one, I envision an eventual romantic relationship with the goal of complete comfort in the vulnerability of another person which implies that we know every single thing about one another and feel totally in tune with each other in doing so. I've always thought of it like having a second half. I know the way I'd treat myself is how I'd treat my partner. I'm completely open and understanding with myself, so it's a given I'd do the same with my partner. I'm very secure and comfortable with myself so it's easy to take on another person who is at the same capability as me in intelligence and empathy. Being able to therefore discuss all matters of topics, enjoying all matters of life, and experiencing the depths of love and intimacy together. I know I'm being pretty conceptual here, and that's indeed my goal. Because I believe the conceptual is what's most important. For example, I _could_ talk about the things I like to do on a daily basis, netflix, anime, reddit, reading, analyzing things, documentaries, thinking, cooking, talking about life and concepts. But going into talking to someone when this is all you really know about them isn't all that telling. Anyone of all matters of beliefs and backgrounds can do the very same things. I want to show my essence as a person here so that we don't waste our time trying to understand whatever it is through talking surface-ly about our interests and eventually finding a telling topic in which turns out we are completely opposed deep down. (And yea, I'm speaking from experience, as you can probably tell.) Here, instead, is my direct way of thinking, my essence. This should come first. I was going to talk more about my desire to become a scientist and all but I'll just leave that for later, the gist of what I said suffices for now. So yea, that seems pretty good. Feeling satisfied with this description. Phew. With that, if you'd like to converse hit me with a pm about yourself or something you found interesting from my post here, it's a great conversation starter. I'd prefer discord since reddit is pretty awful to converse on, but open to anything convenient. In any case, good luck!"

Something along these lines, I'd bet. Hoping to meet someone who just feels right. Well, I'm here for many of the same reasons. In particular for myself, it's pretty simply that I find it hard to find others who are as intelligent, empathetic, yet selfish, as I am. And yes, I said intelligence. I know this gets the iamverysmart eye roll from many, but I don't mind, as I'm sure by the end of this post I will have proven that I don't fall for such shortcomings in such people's mindsets nor that my claims of intelligence are unfounded. So yes, I will say that I am extremely overall intelligent and if you don't believe you are, then we will very likely not be a good fit. There are people who simply don't think much, don't understand much, and don't make sense of much. I see patterns everywhere, have a strong desire for self improvement and avoiding stagnation, I think a lot, and I'm very self aware. I know what I'm capable of while also being wary of what happens when someone thinks highly of themselves. But the fact of the matter is that I just can't click and be stimulated for a long period of time with the vast majority of people. I was born with this intelligence since obviously it's almost entirely genetic. I don't take pride in it. It's just something I was ""lucky"" to get. It's great in some ways, yet lonely in others. It's not that I can't find common ground with many people, it's that stimulation is so hard to find with such people. That stimulation that I've only felt with a few people before is absolutely second-to-none and the most invigoratingly satisfying experience imaginable. I am, although, not looking for someone who is just intelligent in the classic sense, but also emotionally intelligent, however that may be defined. I'm sure we've all met the type who is very intelligent but also just completely socially unaware and just overall awful to be around. This, to me, is much too one-sided and not what I'm looking for. I believe emotional, or maybe ""human"" intelligence is the key here, whatever you want to call it. I am also emotionally intelligent, and finding someone as well rounded as I am has been quite the difficult task for romantic relationships, and really normal friendships as well, much to my dismay. Empathy, for example, being able to see someone else's view, understand it, and feel it on a deep level is imperative for me to build a connection. This is so different than caring about someone. Often times parents care for their children, but aren't empathetic. Most normal relationships are caring but rarely empathetic and that's a damn shame in my eyes. Empathy is hard to do, caring is very easy. But I get it, there's a lot of emotional investment in empathy. A lot of vulnerability and thought required to understand where they're coming from. That's why I restrict it to those who will actually get it, appreciate it, and are capable of returning it. I am deeply considerate and sensitive with those I care for, and continuously better and better at understanding how they think and feel as I learn more about them. It's a truly wonderful feeling. I recently learned about alignments and chaotic neutral is essentially how I am. It's pretty astonishing, really, I've seen so many of the personality tests and labels like mbti and whatnot, but no description has come closer to my essence than the one for chaotic neutral. I've noticed that I'm a bit of an odd case when it comes to empathy. I highly value empathy, but only for those I care about since I only think some people are worth it. I don't believe in any type of moral high ground for anything, society was built on norms that we are forced to follow to keep coherence. Everyone is self-serving, no matter how much they try to rationalize themselves out of that idea, imo. I take it in stride and therefore only care about myself. This also extends to those I care about as I care about them as I do myself. Very deeply, to say the least. Currently that's a couple friends and my sister. I like talking about deep and ""controversial"" topics, our desires, values, and thoughts without filter, pressing questions to get all the way down into our core. I do this introspectively with myself all the time as well. As I said earlier, I have a deep invigoration in self improvement and understanding myself more. I value insightful constructive criticism at all times. Intellectual humility is always worth it, too. If something I say or claim seems to be too emotionally driven without me realizing it, for example, I'd love to know when that happens. I don't think emotionally driven thinking is always bad, only when we don't realize it and try to rationalize it to fit an insecurity. But I must say I think quite rationally regularly. Divergent as well, I'm very creative in how I approach and understand things. If we get to know each other you'll come to find many of my own little concepts I've come up with to explain the world that make a lot of sense. While I am no claimer of ""original"" thought, I do things like devil's advocate and understanding things with as little bias as possible, eventually leading to my own take on things. I want to actually get to know people, but so many seem so vapid. Like most of society, really. I think many social norms are silly. Everyone does the same things, with extremely predictable behavior because it's the expected thing to do, not because they have actually explicitly thought about it on a deep level. I find people who completely concede to becoming products of their environment completely detestable, even though it often happens unknowingly, since the subtle hand of socially influencing ideologies from the cancer of media, church, and politics over decades (really of all time by the ruling class, but I digress) of ubiquitous degeneration of society for capitalist interests has been extremely successful. But still, in the end, it just shows a lack of depth and desire to think for oneself, one that I aim to oppose. I definitely think we all are simply products of our environment, including myself, to quite a large degree, but my pursuit in life constitutes estranging from such a conditioned formation as much as possible. I don't want to go to family meetups because I'm expected to. I don't want to live for my yearly vacation. I don't want to go through the same silly trials and tribulations that shortsighted people always go through. I don't want to repeat the same mistakes of my parents with their kids. I don't want to get stuck in a job I hate regardless of how much money it makes. I don't want to fall for the idea that blood family is ""oh so important"" if they add no value to my life. I don't want to drink alcohol as as a social lubricant. I don't want to fall for media and politics cancer everyday, allowing myself to be formed to the whim of media's desires. I could go on about these in so much detail that this post would become more of a book than it already is by the end of it, so I'll keep it at that for now. I want to fight this conditioning and these expectations. So much is so shallow, so empty, so lacking in meaning and I will do my absolute best to carve out a more meaningful path for myself in this life. My current deduction has therefore led me to two main points. First one is that relationships on a truly deep level are the most important thing, otherwise the rest of life is meaningless. The second would be becoming a scientist of some sort, I absolutely love analyzing things and understanding them deeper, for the gist of it. So how do I actually plan to make these things become reality? Well, the first should be evident as I'm getting myself out there in many ""dating"" related areas, and this would be one of them. I actually met my best friend on reddit here about 2.5 years ago, so my hopes are particularly up for this option. Much like friendships, and starting as one, I envision an eventual romantic relationship with the goal of complete comfort in the vulnerability of another person which implies that we know every single thing about one another and feel totally in tune with each other in doing so. I've always thought of it like having a second half. I know the way I'd treat myself is how I'd treat my partner. I'm completely open and understanding with myself, so it's a given I'd do the same with my partner. I'm very secure and comfortable with myself so it's easy to take on another person who is at the same capability as me in intelligence and empathy. Being able to therefore discuss all matters of topics, enjoying all matters of life, and experiencing the depths of love and intimacy together. I know I'm being pretty conceptual here, and that's indeed my goal. Because I believe the conceptual is what's most important. For example, I could talk about the things I like to do on a daily basis, netflix, anime, reddit, reading, analyzing things, documentaries, thinking, cooking, talking about life and concepts. But going into talking to someone when this is all you really know about them isn't all that telling. Anyone of all matters of beliefs and backgrounds can do the very same things. I want to show my essence as a person here so that we don't waste our time trying to understand whatever it is through talking surface-ly about our interests and eventually finding a telling topic in which turns out we are completely opposed deep down. (And yea, I'm speaking from experience, as you can probably tell.) Here, instead, is my direct way of thinking, my essence. This should come first. I was going to talk more about my desire to become a scientist and all but I'll just leave that for later, the gist of what I said suffices for now. So yea, that seems pretty good. Feeling satisfied with this description. Phew. With that, if you'd like to converse hit me with a pm about yourself or something you found interesting from my post here, it's a great conversation starter. I'd prefer discord since reddit is pretty awful to converse on, but open to anything convenient. In any case, good luck!"

I dont say this out of conceit. Im not superior to or better than anyone else. But I *am* unique...unapologetically so. I tell off-color jokes and laugh with my friends, but theres a part of me they dont see. Almost nobody sees it. Beneath the humor and repartee, theres someone else underneath. Someone I dont let out often, unless its behind a screen. The existential, magical stardust reality of me. Its a person who desires a deeper, meaningful connection. Total honesty. Vulnerability. Intensity. Passion. A man who believes the greatest pursuit in life is to know himself, know others, and *be fully known* by someone. A couple of avenues for this kind of connection have opened up recently. One turned out not to be a good fit. Another is still out there floating in the ether. Will that songbird fly back? Who the fuck knows? But its the best try Ive made in a long time and I can live with that. With that in mind, I guess Ive decided to just fling the doors open wide and see who walks in. I could give you details. Theres my age, which you already know. The fact that Im divorced and that I have two children. Or that Im pretty overweight but trying to get healthier. But thats all just surface chatter. I am so much more than the sum of a few factual statements. In the immortal words of Jaime Lannister, There are no men like me. Only me. And so it is. The truth speaks, and the truth liberates. You might be reading this and thinking to yourself, This guy is weird as fuck. Good. Youre right. My level of weird is, by and large, not universally compatible. Im not casting a wide net, here. I know I wont get very many replies to this post. Thats by design. If youre looking for casual chit-chat, Im not your guy. I want to know what music youre listening to and why it moves you. Tell me the dream you had last night and what it made you feel when you woke up. Give me honesty. Give me depth. Give me intensity. I expect there are probably only one or two of you out there who are 1) intrigued by and 2) capable of engaging on this level. Again, thats okay. People are different and they each have their own needs and desires. These are just mine, and they happen to be very particular. Ive fooled myself by making ads here in the past that more closely conform to the norm but I am not the norm. So I decided to make this one instead. Its more closely aligned with the truth of who I am. Complicated. Messy. Deep. Intense. Imperfect. Wondrous. And now lets see what happens."

It takes a special person to survive on reddit, as well as in life. Maybe the red headed woman whom I met on Spruce Knob in the 1980s will be on here, or the skiing teacher on Roan Mountain, or the many others I wish Id kept up with. I am semi-retired. While older, in rather good shape, enjoying fast bicycle rides, hikes, trips. Physically, I am 5 10 / 178 cm tall, 170 lbs / 78 kg. Short/thin ash-blond/brown hair, blue eyes, gray mixed beard, only 2 replaced teeth (impacts during my early years). I am 65 years old, and enjoying every minute of it. Have been archaeologist, bicycle frame builder, auto mechanic, geologist, environmental scientist, attorney and now make violins. Well educated, well traveled, and well aware of how little I and anyone else really knows about the world and nature of life. I am a reasonable mix of extroverted and introverted, dealing well with people and groups, but enjoying alone time when working on detailed things, in the outdoors, and for playing music. I dont smoke. I like beer, will drink Scotch and Bourbon, but dont like being drunk or anywhere close to that. I wont drive or make important decisions after even one beer. I will smoke that other stuff at times, but dont seek it out. Not impressed with the whole concept of soulmate. I do not expect someone else to fulfill all my needs and desires, someone to hold me up. How can anyone know me better than I know me, and I learn new things all the time! Relationships take work, ebb and flow over time, and need space to evolve. I am not inclined to cage a partner, or to enforce some ancient concept of monogamy. I am not wedded to the concept that a partner in life, full or part time, necessarily needs to be a sexual partner. Romance, love, partnership can exist without sex, just as sex occurs between people without love or commitment. Although I admit to being rather partial to cuddling! Neither am I convinced that age appropriate relationships exist. I have had wonderful friendships and more with people both older and substantially younger people. While I tend to find myself getting along best with folks between 40 and 70, I regularly run into people outside that range that surprise and delight me. I am also unconvinced that God desires us to mate or partner or whatever with only those of an opposing gender, or that individuals must fit some socially driven mold in actions, dress, behavior, and everything else. At this point, I dont really care. People seem to be at their very best without artiface, without makeup, without clothes, ideally in a mountain hot spring after a long hike. If you like what you read and are a 25 year old guy, write me. If you are a 55 year old librarian woman dreaming of the open road, the slip stream whipping buy, endless horizons, and the throb of a V Twin beneath you, drop me a line. Good matches are often surprises. I am not really ideally suited to parent kids at this point in my life. Not that I wouldnt, but it would take lots and lots of thought and consideration. I am also sterile, so no more kids for me. I have two ex wives, two part-time girl friends in different places (who are very much aware and approving of each other), neither who can be a mostly full-time traveling and partnering companion, and neither of whom I am really interested in living with full time. I have two grown children. And an old fuzzy dog. I like cats, too. A FEW AREAS WITH MINOR DETAILS Hobbies: I am no longer sure what a hobby is. I do outdoors things. I have a nice road bicycle I ride a lot. A fixed gear track bike set for the road with a single brake. I mostly ride on paths here in northern Virginia, into DC and such. I have no issue getting around cities. I have a hard mountain bike for touring, but I havent done real mountain biking. I would be willing to try. I use a sea kayak (have done off shore, lake, river, ocean and inland touring, and even lake commuting via kayak). I have done a lot of canoe travel, including whitewater. I ride a goodly sized sport cruiser. Touring around the local area. Ive ridden in the southeast a lot. Dragon, Six Gaps, etc. Id like to ride to the Rockies. Canada. Vermont. I have done a lot of riding with a passenger. Its more fun to have a companion on another bike with communicators. I also enjoy car touring. Hiking and camping I have done a great deal of, from mega-dump camping through deep desert work camping to backpacking. Hiking from strolls through multi-day long hikes. I get dragged birding a good deal. Indoors, I read. Make things (like violins). Write (like reddit). Cook a good deal. I like cooking. Ill try dancing, yoga, almost anything that might be fun! Im also a casual nudist. I tend to like nudists and like running around naked, jumping in pools and hot tubs, playing pool volleyball, partying etc. It isnt important to me, just a nice relaxing thing. Doesnt seem abnormal. However, society at large seems to equate nude with sex, which is nonsense. Music: Anything good. Ive seen Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd, David Bowie etc in concert. Even the Beatles when I was a kid. Not so fond of rap and some of this modern stuff. Trained in piano, classical guitar. Performed at one time or another on a wide range of instruments. Dont play much now. Food: I am extremely fond of food, so its a good thing I bicycle all the time! Seafood very much. Pasta is good. Grilling. Cajun style. Southern in general. Italian. Pizza. I enjoy cooking, especially with company. Ill try just about anything. Sex stuff Everyone seems to ask this. I dont have an outrageous sex drive, and am actually just fine without sexual contact. This is not an ad for a sexual partner. However, sex is amazing between (or perhaps among) people with that click or whatever it is. People have needs, and if they can find those are satisfied between each other, all the better. Im pretty easy going. I dont demand reciprocation. If my associate is horny and Im not, Ill help out with great pleasure. I have lots of compersion, so if my friend or partner wants to get off with some other person Im all for it, if its in the negotiated ground rules. Im maybe 80/20 bi. Or 90/10. I far prefer women. But some men are super dishy. I am not a particularly dominant person, but I can play one if thats your thing. More an equal partner cuddler, where parity in role and relaxation are important. Where Im game to travel. I want to travel. I want someone to travel with. Im also somewhat of a home body, and would love to find someone to nest with. If not, thats OK, too. My travel goals at the moment include US Southwest, ideally by motorcycle; hikes in the Blue Ridge; a US Southeast motorcycle tour; hiking and bicycling Vermont &amp; the Adirondacks. Kayak in the Great Lakes and Maine coast. I could go on. Living? I kind of have a recurring dream of living with a special lady who makes pottery and hangs out in hammocks in Sedona, AZ, loves to dual sport motorcycle, and cooks incredible Mexican food alternating with my eclectic mix. However, so many places are wonderful. I really should live in a van. Likely down by the river. WHO ARE YOU? You are kind, compassionate, and a lifelong learner, interested in being alive, emotionally available to grow a relationship. Looking for a partner to develop an intimate friendship - a reciprocal relationship involving honesty, kindness, dedication, loyalty, and support. You might well be polyamorous, and find my description compelling enough to write. I am perfectly willing, perhaps even preferring, not to be the sole partner of someone. Even a long distance relationship that focuses on a few visits and a single big trip a year would be a fabulous development for me, and I suspect would fit a certain class of others. I really need to be accepted, and am willing to accept. We are all in careers or retired or whatever, have our health and other issues, our fears, our battles. Helping each other and being honest about those things are important. I understand that sharing those battles involves trust, trust that exposes vulnerability, and I am honored when people trust me. Communication, agreement, no sabotage, ask and answer. Especially in resolving conflict. And in expressing and figuring out needs. Physically, your appearance is somewhat relevant, and I cant really put up with horribly disorganized living. Personality and that spark are far more important than either of those. At minimum you are of weight/height proportion. I am programmed to see shorter women as more appropriate, but I seem to enjoy taller women, too! In men, I havent figured out what I like. Its rare for me to be attracted to a man. I dont care about skin color, hair color, eye color. The hardest thing is that chemical attraction part. Thats important and impossible to describe! And can change. If youre at all interested or curious, and have read this far, please drop me a note with as much detail as seems reasonable. Im looking for excuses to travel and meet people. Thank you"

I'm in this funky place where I want to be with someone but don't know how to be with someone. I'm so used to being on my own that there's a lot of anxiety that comes with bonding. I learned how to self-sooth and develop (semi) healthy coping strategies. I know how to be happy when I'm alone, and how to fill my day with things that keep me grounded and sane. How does one incorporate someone else into that? I get these silly thoughts and doubts and I downright panic. I feel like I'm not interesting, or I have too much emotional baggage, I'm moving too fast, I'm not moving fast enough, **they're just being nice and don't know how to back out.** That's actually my biggest one. I'm almost convinced I'm never worth the prolonged attention I get. It's all anxiety I know, but that thought alone makes me feel too damaged. I don't want to be the girl that needs constant reassurance and coddling. The easy solution? Sabotage. Give them a concrete reason to run for the hills. Imagine being fully aware of your self destructive behavior and still doing it. Madness. I know. Funny enough, it's easier to mend something I know I broke, then mend something someone else broke because I let my guard down. Does that even make sense? **TLDR; My issue now is finding a person that is patient. Finding a connection that develops sans pressure. Without needing to hit those imaginary milestones. A real friendship that develops through communication, vulnerability, and intimacy.** *A few things to note* Please please, read some of my other posts. I swear I'm not always this somber. Don't send me a generic message. I'm sure they work well with others but I won't respond. I'm of West African decent (read: black). Five foot six and not at all skinny. I have ""womanly"" curves that I'm both proud and annoyed at depending on the day and outfit. I'm comfortable with my body and not on the process of losing anything. Calling me chocolate will get you blocked and the classic ""I've never been with a black girl"" line will get you a 3 paragraph lecture that I have saved on my phone as to why you absolutely should not be saying that to women of color.

You are not afraid to show physical affection, in appropriate settings. You don't feel ashamed in expressing yourself, specially if there are any physical or emotional needs that are not met. You are comfortable with confrontation. You resolve problems by talking about them, finding the root cause. This doesn't mean that you don't enjoy the occasional banter, sarcasm, and enjoy to debate. You discuss with mutual kindness and civility You have your own hobbies. It doesn't matter to me if you play videogames, have a hundred board games, you knit, cosplay, sing in the shower, or enjoy weird extreme sports. What matters to me is that you keep those hobbies as part of your identity, and use it to bring occasional space to the relationship. Your looks are somewhat important, but they are nothing without a good personality. At minimum you are of weight/height proportion, you practice good hygiene behaviours, and you like to maintain a clean living space. I do gravitate towards taller (than me), bearded men. This doesn't mean that I don't like the opposite in looks. Looks can and will change. I know someone with all these specific qualities may not exist. But if you feel identified by this post, please reach out to me with a similar message in kind. Talk about yourself and how you feel identified with this post. I want to hear from you. Hope you are having a good day!"

Intentionally. I would just post this in r/offmychest or some other place but I am genuinely looking for someone to connect with and/or talk to. I just feel this is the best way to get a desirable reply at this point. I have been thinking about writing this post all day, and now that I'm home and able I've forgotten most of it. Go figure, eh? I feel like I'm having a bit of a mid-life existential crisis. I don't know who I am, or what I'm doing anymore. Ever feel bad about the things you like to do? Or just like...constantly judging and berating yourself; ""I *should* be doing X, why am I spending my time doing Y"". Eat this, don't eat that. Sleep at this time, not at that time. Enjoy your job, smile, and just be grateful. Every step of the way is an argument in your head. You can't *just* be. It's been like this constantly for me lately. Stress just compounds onto itself and never really gets relieved. I feel like all I do know about myself lately are these few things: I'm a geek. I love games. I love making other people happy. And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

I'm new to the area and interested in meeting a kind, liberal, ambitious man for cute dates and (possible) sexy times.... and seeing where that takes us, yeah? Also: I'm queer and poly and lean toward ethical non-monogamy, so ideally you'd be flexible towards that. I love art museums, dive bars, indie movie theatres, punk shows, and any media that makes me step back and reassess the world around me. (I listen to a LOT of therapy and sexual health podcasts, and write a LOT of romance fiction, so that's pretty much all you need to know about me). I'm 23 years old, tough, tender, and tiny. In all relationships, I'm devoted. Sharp as a whip. I'm curvy, petite in the chest and thick in the booty (where it counts, let's be real), short hair, tattooed, vaguely goth. Think Lena Dunham but 10x cuter and 1000x sweeter. In bed, I have heavily submissive leanings and would love to find a dude with dominant/Dom leanings. I love affectionate, firm, uplifting, consensual cruelty. **That said, curiosity and communication skills are all you need to pique my interest.** I will, of course, send you a photo straight away if I'm interested! I'm into: patience, enthusiastic consent, emotional vulnerability, compassion, open-mindedness, physical displays of affection, being appreciated beyond my body, learning new things, trying new things, frank yet sensitive communication, feeling special, and being special. I also love The Office more than anything in this world. You: 25-35, residing in the Raleigh area and preferably able to host. You're able to express yourself emotionally and be vulnerable; you seek this in others. You live your life with compassion, care, and positivity. You're able to express yourself emotionally and be vulnerable; you seek this in others. You have an intuition about people, can catch on to what they're hiding and what they might be afraid of. You're stable and feel confident you can provide stable, steady support and meet with regularity. I'd love to know more about you. What makes you tick? What are you passionate about? What are your values? What makes you curious, in and out of the bedroom? \*\*\* IMPORTANT\*\*\* Please PM me if interested - and only PM. If you leave a comment, Kik me, Fetlife me, show up at my house... you're going to be blocked. Also, photos in first message are ideal (but, you know, privacy - I get it!). Other things that will get you immediately and gleefully blocked:  You don't live in the Raleigh area and/or you aren't mobile  You cannot host (this is a big one tbh)  You have zero kink experience  You send me a dick pic  You wax poetic about your dick ()  You're creepy and/or overly graphic and/or objectify me in your messages ps: ONCE AGAIN, NO DICK PICS.

I know that typically people put together a long list of their likes and dislikes and the things that make them unique. Everyone is an avid hiker, loves their friends and family, and is looking to be like their favorite couple from The Office or Parks and Rec. I like to hike occasionally, I love my friends and family, and I love both of those shows...but does it really accurately describe me or what I'm looking for? Not really. The truth is that I'm a relatively funny guy who has trouble connecting with people initially, so people often completely miss out on that aspect of myself when we meet. I go on dates and everyone seems like they are putting on a mask and hiding who they really are. I'm the same way. I play this character of a friendly and happy go lucky guy who is bland, doesn't know how to flirt and struggles to make an instant connection (which is what everyone seems to be looking for in this era of instant gratification). I'm not that guy though. I'm sarcastic, witty, and often a little bit cynical, but generally with a positive attitude in life. I'm vulgar at times and can have a dark sense of humor that my friends ""get"" but I tend to not show to someone right away. All of that makes it hard to build a connection with someone...and that's what I want to do. I want to get to know someone and develop a real connection that goes beyond a first date that either leads to a ghosting or a hookup with little in between. Where's the real talk? Where's the real emotions and vulnerability that people used to show of themselves? I want to fall in love, I want to make someone happy, I want to have someone in my life who cares. I can offer those things on the other side as well, at least once we've built something together. No one has any patience anymore though. Man, I'm whining a lot. I am not a whiny person, I tend to believe that things happen in their own time and eventually the right pairing will come along. I'll find someone where it just ""clicks"" and things will work themselves out...but in modern dating I am not sure how often things like that happen anymore. You either see people settling for the first person that comes along or you have people who never settle for anything less than perfection. Who wants to put in the time to create something wonderful together? That's what I want. The basics: I'm 38, a bigger guy who is getting smaller through diet and exercise (down 100 pounds so far, but still have about 75 more to go). I'm bearded and usually keep it fairly well maintained and it's of the non-neck variety. I sometimes wear cargo shorts and flip flops, but I'm also a father of a 6 year old, so it's to be expected. I won't wear either on a date with you though. I love sports, music, movies, exploring the local area, finding weird places to see."

It's love who must find us. So I stopped looking for you, but I just want you to know that there is not a day going by without me thinking about you and that I will never let this hope fade away. Many people would say that you have to be particularly daring and idealistic to believe in True Love in 2019. There is a certain taboo when we are talking about love. Yes, we release some sighs of happiness, some ""it's cute"", but we do not marvel too openly about beautiful love stories. Instead, we are doing it secretly at home with our box of kleenex beside us, but always by being a little contained, not showing too much our sensitive, dreamer and idealist side, because, at this moment, we are more in the era of ""fast-food relationship"". So, we love on ""hold"", without asking too many questions, without being invested too much. We start a relationship with someone just because it makes us comfortable and it makes the time pass faster on a lonely Friday night. Just to do like everyone else. It takes us both out of our solitude and it fills our desires. But in all this, what is left of love? Do you still believe in True Love? The one who chooses us. To the one who leaves us no choice. To the one who capsizes us and changes our little life. Do you believe that someone, somewhere, can take your breath away just by its mere existence? I do believe in it. I believe in you and me. I believe in total self-giving, abandonment and shared vulnerability. So, I dream of you, of us and then, I confess, I don't say it too hard, fearing to be pointed out and be called a princess. I believe that in life, there are people who leave an indelible mark on us and I have no doubt that when you cross my path, I will recognize you because that feeling never lies. Whoever you are, wherever you are, I am ready for anything. I am not afraid of us. I will take you as you are, with your own way of being unique. I will love you, no matter what is your story and no matter how deep are your scars because all of this will be part of the person you are. I will be there, good weather, bad weather, with the same desire to discover you and to contemplate you being yourself. It is with love that I will swim to you with a breath of happiness to make your heart, my island. So, I am asking once again. Do you believe in True Love?

Not infatuation. Just unconditional love, platonic and romantic. What was my favorite parts of that? What kept me going? When did I decide that I was going to give this person that gift. Yes, unconditional love from ANYONE is a gift and should be accepted graciously. I realized that I do the thing I have never gotten a man to do for me. Not to say that I'm upset about it. I just wasn't meant for those people. Right. That thing? **I just decide to love every day.** I could go on and on about what love means to me and why people fail at it but yeah. That's what I did. It wasn't anything specific thing a guy did that hooked me. I picked someone, and then picked them again, and again. *Instead of talking about me (I could do it all day), I wanna talk about love and what I love about love:* **The laughter.** When I love you I want to make you laugh or smile. However I can. It might be selfish because it makes me feel good and happy. **The vulnerability.** For me personally, in order to feel like I know someone, I need to know them in every ""season."" When you're happy is easy, when you're sad is challenging, and when you're angry it's difficult. I love the variances because it real. If I want superficial I'll hop on tinder and send brad a ""u up"" text at 2am. (Sorry if your name is actually brad. Ily) **The intimacy.** Cuddling and banging. I rely on the initial connection to remind me. I'm someone that needs reassurance all the time. When I first started my job, I called my boss every week and was like ""how am I doing??"" After like 4 weeks he was like ""stfu."" But seriously, I reach out half because it feels good, and half because I'm non verbally double checking that we're good. I'm not going to list anything about kind words. I assume everyone lies so, telling me you're into to me doesn't mean Jack shit. Pull your pants down and prove it. Kidding. Or am i? Hahahaha even I don't know **The fights.** I don't want to fight a lot. Genuinely. But, they are telling as hell. I'm a communicator. I won't shut up. I love when a conflict is resolved. The process is beautiful. Especially if we're better coming out of it than when we went in. Fuck that's the best. Unless you tell me some shit like Batman is your favorite. I'll dump you where you stand and text brad in your face because no...just absolutely bye. Hahahaha remember when I said I'd talk about you. I'm so bad at this."

I'll cut to the chase because I know this will filter out a good half of you due to intimidation. I don't care what your interests are and talking about music, movies, games, books, or any form of entertainment is a terrible way to get to know someone. Do I really not care about those things? No, I have my own interests and I'm happy to share them but talking about mutual interests establishes nothing in a conversation. You like Game of Thrones too? Wow, great, so does some countless horde of millions of rabid fans because it's one of the most popular shows out there. More obscure things can help this, but generally the same issues remain when it comes to compatibility. If you're not aligned with what I want and vise versa, the conversation will die and we would have both wasted our times. So what is it, exactly, that I want? I want someone to talk to on a regular basis. I'd like them to think at least somewhat like I do about the world and life in general. I'd like them to understand that while a relationship that comes from one of these posts would be nice to have from the get go, a real one won't form that quickly. I'd like someone who wants that deeper meaning from a relationship. A relationship based in devotion to mutual improvement and attraction based on character. Someone that understands that people exist in a constant state of flux, and that everyone will change in the long term, but that sticking around is worth it. Sure, the person you met a few years ago might seem a little different, maybe that's the rose colored glasses coming off or time just changing who they are. What makes a good relationship last is not that initial spark, but a mutual interest in maintaining that great person you met. Because a good relationship is filled with vulnerability and honesty even when it's painful. Because people make mistakes, we're just human after all. Make time to sit down every week or so and talk what's going wrong and what's going right and not have it be a battle. It needs to come from a place of mutual growth. Finding someone you can trust not to freak out at the smallest thing is one of the greatest achievements you can get in this life. I couldn't care less about where you're from, the internet makes long distance possible. As long as you want what I've described, a relationship that is as much about giving as it is receiving, I'm interested. Make your message long and try not to include the boring bits we all get here. I know, I know, that band is *really* cool and this food is what you like to relax with on rainy days like today, but that really doesn't tell me about who you are, which is why I'm making this post in the first place. If you want to know more about me, message me, but if that's too much of an effort to make, here's the basics. I am 24. I am American. I speak two languages. I have a Masters and three Bachelor degrees. I work fulltime at a good tech job and I'm on track to becoming salaried at the end of my contract. I have family, but Mom's been six feet under for a year in 15 days. I've had relationships, mostly long-term ones. I want to settle down. I would like to have kids, eventually. Politics are incredibly personal and say more about where you're from than who you are so don't talk to me about them right off the bat. No drugs, drink sometimes, fuck smoking cigs because they've killed a lot of my family and I'm not falling on the same sword. Not religious, but I understand why people are and there's some good stuff to learn from it, raised Methodist. I have average looks, above average height, and I'm white with blond hair and green eyes. I'm very cut and dry here, but in person I tend to be amiable and surprisingly funny ~~that's what they all say, right?~~ It's hard to offend me, I have a surprisingly high tolerance for people and I rarely get angry. So send me a message with some work, see if we're a good fit, and if you've read this and for some reason would like to tell me off like half the messages I get every time I post, join the crowd I guess."

It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest.

It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this?

Have you seen The Haunting of Hill House? Do you remember when Nell said, ""I'm like a small creature swallowed whole by a monster, and the monster feels my tiny little movements inside""? *Yeah*. I've been feeling that recently. Not in a bad/depressing way, though! My head just feels a little fuzzy sometimes when I think about how big the world is. So many people, sights, and moments existing simultaneously alongside me. It's a lot for my two brain cells to handle. I thought I could work through that feeling by potentially getting to know some of the many people out there--aka, you all. I'd like to think I'm a fairly simple person. I have a mushy-gushy marshmallow heart and am drawn to all things tender. I'm clueless a majority of the time, so you can rest assured that I don't play mind games. I say what I mean and I mean what I say. I'm passionate about people, animals, and making things the tiniest bit better in whichever way I can. We can talk about anything and everything. I love all forms of art, memes, and reading about things that will never once come in handy for me. I'd liken myself to an adult cat, because I can technically be left to my own devices, but probably shouldn't. My favorite movies are Hereditary and Moonlight. My favorite author is Gillian Flynn. I'm partial to Hozier and Mitski. Please, tell me your faves and help expand my horizons a little.  Once the awkward ""Hello, I Promise I'm Not An Ice Pick Murderer"" phase is over, I would be happy to give you my discord handle. If we hit it off, but you don't have discord, that's fine. Where there's a will there's a way! I've been in enough group projects that I have pretty much every app under the sun now. Speaking of, I'm a full-time student, but I have a shitty sleep schedule, so anyone from any timezone is welcome to message me. Feel free to tell me about yourself!  **P.S.** I'd like to make it extra clear that I'm only looking for friends right now. No romance or hanky panky. Only clownery and vulnerability. **P.S.S.** I'm very left-leaning and I'm all about love and respect for my fellow man. Be kind or begone. "

It's been a long time since I've been active on r4r, and I thought that while I'm lonely, I might as well give it another shot on a rainy Friday down in Sydney. Honestly, I'm looking for something intimate, a connection that I can really open up with, and in return the same. I haven't really shared vulnerability with someone in a while. Although I've been on maybe half a dozen dating apps and maybe a dozen or so dates, I've met up with some neat people in the past from reddit so I'd like to replicate some of that success. Some quick fire facts about me: 28 year old chef from Sydney, I'm about 5'6"" (or a bit above 165cm,) skinny and somewhat active because of my job. I'm introverted and I like the indoors. There's just something so comforting about curling up and being cozy. BUT I like to get out of my comfort zone sometimes, I like to explore, and I definitely like having company around. Just under a year ago I went on a really cool trip and met some really cool people. Despite the ups and downs during the trip (including ""moroccan mudslides"" affecting plenty) it was a really fun time, and I hoped I made the trip better for a lot of people too. One thing I tried to keep in mind was ""Leave people better than you found them"" and I felt happy that at least I gave a good attempt at that! I'd think some of that attributed to unsuspecting I was. Usually I was a bit quiet, but I could definitely be surprising when I wanted to, with a quick quip or an appropriately dirty joke. I made someone snort-laugh and that was a highlight of the trip. Not all of it was just humour, there were a few moments where I may or may not have said a few profound things. I'm planning to make a trip around the US and visit a few of the in the middle of this year. Well I also want to make plans to do other things, including hit up a lot of good food, being a chef and all. (Recommendations welcome, I'm probably hitting up the west coast for most of the trip.) Growing up aussie born chinese with parents in the hospitality business, I appreciate a lot of food. I also don't mind the mix of sweet and savoury (pineapple can go with pizza, but has to be paired with other toppings!) I get a little excitable about sweets, and I've love to have someone around who feels the same way. I like my gaming (Switch, PC,) but I also enjoy watching my share of shows/movies. MCU is a yes, and the shows are also a yes for me. Game-wise, I've recently been playing Apex Legends (when it hasn't been crashing/lagging out,) Dota 2 and a few games on my Switch. I enjoy games a lot more when I play with people I can banter with. Having a buddy/team is pretty much integral to my enjoyment of some games. This all reduces down to me wanting to find someone I share interests with (but still has their own things going on,) wants a balance between hanging out indoors and out, likes trying new things, but also someone I can connect deeper with and just feel comfortable with, even in silence. To at least lead a conversation a bit, tell me about a time you've affected someone for the better (or so you hope,) your best dirty joke and 3 things this year that you've spent a lot of time or attention on (aside from the obvious.)"

In-n-Out? That awesome little hole in the wall restaurant? The possibilities are endless! Anyways, hello! At the moment, my plan for this upcoming Thursday night is to sit at home and do nothing. I'm looking to change that; maybe you are too! I'm a 23 year old Asian-American guy born and raised in southern California. I'm looking for a connection - whether it's just as a food buddy, new friendship, something more, or all of the above, food makes most people happy so lets go get some! As far as my physical characteristics go, I am 5'8 and 150lbs. I honestly think I'm average. Like, the type of average where you'd point to my picture and say ""meh"". I broke out a bit last week so that doesn't help matters :( Some interests include: - Obligatory Movies/shows/etc.- I, like many other people, have a Netflix subscription. *surprised pikachu* - Fitness- I do run regularly, I'm at my local Crunch ~4 times a week, and I live a (albeit pretty lax) fitness lifestyle. - Games- KH3? Smash Ultimate? Neverending Steam library? The list goes on~ - Music- My music taste bounces around a lot but I'm always a sucker for EDM (especially trance and liquid dnb). Please share your music with me! - The beach- I live near the beach and I like the beach. Shocker right?! - Cooking- I make *awesome* Thanksgiving stuffing. Also, most of the food I make is quite edible if I do say so myself. - Making lists? So, that's a little bit about me. As for you, I don't really have any specific limitations off the top of my head. Just be at least 50% human and that's cool with me. Jokes aside, I do have a soft spot for someone that likes to laugh a lot; I am generally pretty upbeat, talkative, smiley and whatnot, and I like people that fall within the same universe of that category. Bonus points if you're the person among your friends with *that* laugh because I'm that person and we can compare our laughs. Although it feels weird to mention the ""laughs a lot"" part, it's genuinely important to me; I grew up a bit insecure about my laugh and learned to mask it but I'm much more comfortable about it now and just usually let it out. Moment of vulnerability there! If anything within this post resonates with you, then great! You should message me if one or more of the following apply: - You like to eat ramen - You feel like we might get along - You want to get a free meal I'll leave it at that! If it sounds like we'd get along, please tell me about yourself! You can share whatever you're comfortable with sharing, but I'd like to at least know your favorite food(s). On that note, I have discord and snapchat as my messaging platforms and I'd be happy to share whichever one you prefer. Thanks for reading and have a great day! "

Hi  Im a grad student living in central Florida. Im a native to the area and havent lived anywhere else but am not opposed to moving once Ive graduated. I go to Disney world a lot and drink way too much Boba tea. Ive recently become obsessed with Pad Thai and have been eating it about once every two weeks. My favorite color is yellow, but none of that pastel stuff. Only mustard yellow  Im an INFP, enneagram 6 (if this means anything to you) and those videos of baby elephants make me cry because they look so happy. Im a big ball of feelings and emotions so if thats not your speed then sorry not sorry because i tend to feel very deeply. I grew up in a family of intellectuals, so smarts, wits, deep critical thinking is a huge turn on for me; essentially being able to keep up with deeper conversations. Ive made a r4r post before and nothing has ever really come from them and Id pretty much given up for a moment, but I feel like I may have caught a second wind. Im determined to find the happiness and joy that comes from finding someone that makes life a little bit better. Someone that shows me the beauty of a life together and how exhilarating and scary and challenging and fulfilling that can be. What i want right now: I dont need romanticism or for you to sweep me off my feet (even though those things are very sweet and will get you tons of brownie points ) I want vulnerability and openness. Someone who is willing to be patient with me and my baggage, just as i will be patient with yours. River banks...fish keep their money in riverbanks  I am black somewhat curvy. I have black hair and brown eyes. Im 54 and horrible at describing myself haha so you can request a photo and I can send one  Some fine print: - Please be older than 27 - live in North America (LDR dont bother me) - No married men or men already in relationships. - If youre not interested in a long term serious relationship please dont message me. Im not interested in a fuck buddy or FwB at all. "

She liked it that way. She seemed put together and sure footed. Third booth on the right. If not the third booth, then a table. But always on the right. It seems that bad things always come from the right and she wanted to be prepared. Have you ever watched a movie where the attack comes from the left? No, I didn't think so. He noticed things like that. He noticed the unexplainable. He connected the dots for her, when she couldn't. He put together the pieces that connected her past with the present. He transformed the Celtic folk sagas into stories that played out in her life, and when she wasn't sure how worthy she was, he told her all the stories all over again, but with her as queen and victor. His hands touched her body like she was a queen, dancing around her ticklish spots. Painting the universe's beauty across her, and drawing the constellations from her hip to her shoulders. His words and finger tips performed the gentle art of healing her. His whispers of the truth, just spoke what was inside her. He touched her body in ways she did not know it deserved to be touched and allowed her to be weak and broken and beautiful all at once. She was not prepared this. Her twenty word long orders to the world were gone. His words opened her up. His hands reached even deeper inside her. Every time she began to speak and even protest this assault, he found another part of her to unwind and undress.

Please know that being mine requires a large amount of vulnerability. You will be my object. My sexual toy. That will be one of your primary uses, a slut for me to use as I will. I'm into a large variety of kinks, a large number of them tied to either sadism, humiliation, or absolute control. When I demand it, you will offer yourself to me, for my pleasure, as is your duty, as is your purpose. But vulnerability is primarily a mental thing, and that you will surrender to me as well. You will tell me all of your insecurities and your secrets. All of the things that you're ashamed of, all the things that make you feel weak and of little worth. You'll know that you belong to the one that you serve, the one who accepts you unconditionally as you are, and in that you have a place of strength and comfort. Most importantly, I'm looking for someone who yearns to fully collapse into submission. Who finds that in the service of someone else is the only place where she can truly bare her soul."

A few months ago, I saw this short piece about [""36 questions that lead to love""](URL and since then I've been interested in trying it with someone. You can read the list of questions [here](URL A lot of the questions are really personal, stuff that you normally wouldn't share with someone you've just met, but that's what makes this so interesting to me. It's difficult to find a time and place to show real vulnerability and create emotional intimacy with someone, and I figure if we go into this knowing up front that we're both trying to find the same thing, it'll be a lot easier for that to happen. Despite what the title of my post says, I'm not going into this with the specific goal of falling in love, but I am open to the *possibility* of it. My main goal here is just for us to get to *really* know each other. That being said, I am mostly looking to do this with with someone who is within driving distance just in case this does actually lead to anything. So I'd prefer it if you lived within a few hours of the PA/NJ border. So if you've read this whole thing and decided you're interested in giving this a shot, message me for my discord or skype info (I'd prefer to do this over voice chat) so we can answer these questions together.

I am just sorta a mess of a girl looking for my own happiness... So, I have never been in a real relationship before but do have a pretty good idea what I want/have to offer as a potential romantic partner. Because I completely wasted my time waiting on an unrequited love interest that was never meant to be anything more and have made bad/questionable decisions in a moment of weakness ... I finally wised up; its time I let go and find the someone that still want to be with me despite of them. I am looking for a emotional bond that will be meaningful to us in the long-term. I would like for us to start very slow. I dont feel there needs to be a rush to dive head first into a relationship, as it will come into fruition with time span together and effort on both sides. Eventually, when we are both ready, I want sexual experiences with you..probably lots of it. I want us to communicate comfortably with each other, without the fear of judgement and abandonment. Allow us to be our authentic-self.. no masks, no walls. Ill be honest: I am a hopeless romantic at heart and for a long while, I was after this grandiose fairytale of romance/partner that was ,well, very non-existent. My rose-colored glasses have cracked going through several jaded experiences, I am beginning to see what love is not. Romance to me now means trust, respect, empathy, compassion, vulnerability, support, and devotion. I dont expect you and our potential relationship to be perfect. We could try to make it work by how much we will care about each other and choose to be in a relationship. Still, I want to go on these old-fashion romantic dates and do all the cutesy affectionate things that couple do... like, I want to build sandcastles in the beach, stay up at night to stargaze together, play board games in a cozy cafe, take a stroll in the sunny gardens and admire the flowers, dance to live music... okay, you may cringe but dont pretend you dont secretly enjoy it too :p I acknowledge I have flaws; Im highly sensitive. Im very moody. Im stubborn. Im too idealistic. Im impractical. Im lazy. Im a people-pleaser. Im hot and cold. Im melancholy. I'm indecisive. I'm flaky. Im insecure. I ramble. I worry too often, about anything and everything. Not right away though, but I do want to be married and have a family some day. Only when were both ready to take the next step and move forward with our future plans. I am not in a rush to get married at all, especially for all the wrong reasons. I have to know we want to be with each other in the present and see a future together. We will have to be on the same page with our values/life goals. Potential dealbreaker: I may or may not want to have our own children (adoption is very likely as an alternative. ). Youll have to be okay with my uncertainty on this right now. I really love children and ultimately, want them but I just dont know if I can be a good mother to them. Same anxiety applies to whether I will be a good housewife to you. So, where am I in life right now? Recently, I had a fallout with a career pathway, and currently seeking a new direction (dont know where itll take me but I like to think I am moving forward). I still live with my parents. But I am trying my best to take care of myself and be a responsible adult. I want to become more independent so you wont have to worry/feel the need to always baby me (only when Im really sad, please give me lots of hugs and cuddles, and space too). I have personal aspirations/dreams/career goals/relationship goals I want to at least try to achieve and if I fail, I know I will be okay and its not the end of the world now. As for religion, Im not religious (probably agnostic if I have to put a label on me) but I am spiritual in a sense that I have an interest in the new-age woo woo and have adapted to a lot of Eastern/Zen Buddhism philosophy to make sense of this world. Im not okay with over-zealous religious/politics fanatics (I have little interest in politics to be honest). Appearance wise, I am generally your girl-next-door type. I am tiny and dont have much of a womanly figure (hard for me to gain weight but trying). I can send you my face pics. So if you made it this far and decided you want to take a chance with me, PM me if interested and maybe we can chat to get to know and where we want to start with this. Thanks for reading! "
297,vulnerability,r4r,"32 [M4F] Anywhere - ""Dear ___,"" a letter to my person three years in the making",1,abczff,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/abczff/32_m4f_anywhere_dear_a_letter_to_my_person_three/,2019-01-01 11:14:02,"Dear ___, Its been a while since Ive written you. Ive spent many hours, over many years, staring at blinking cursors in blank documents and textboxes - even at blank pages in books with a pen in hand - to little avail. Actually, I even took such a said book and pen to the top of a [scenic overlook](URL last month, hoping that the perspective and solitude would inspire enough courage/patience/creativity/luck to get something down on a page, only to waste half of the book trying to write Dear legibly in the freezing wind at 3,197 feet with the pages flying all over the place and my hand barely able to grip the pen from the cold - I then took it home, wrote several pages under a warm roof on Christmas day, wondered how anyone can write anything without an immediately available backspace button, and declared my handwriting entirely impossible to read by anyone but myself. And so, here we are. There, a paragraph. Progress. With so much to say, so much to share, so much to express, this may be a bit all-over-the-place. I hope youll find my lack of basic organizational skills and tendency to immensely overthink at least unoffensive and at most endearing, as they are fairly accurate representations of who I am. This time of year is always interesting. The semi-imposed reflective quality of New Years Eve - looking back on the old year and setting goals for the new, reliving memories and events that have shaped you into who you are today, picturing yourself in your best life and making your best guesses as to the steps which will take you there - combined with the bizarre energy surrounding Christmas and being at home with family - which I still claim to be my favorite holiday, despite the encroaching feeling of isolation that has grown with it the past few years (with enough new marriages, nieces/nephews, illnesses, and deaths, it seems more is different than is the same when we were young and it was there was still magic) and spending a few nights in the room you grew up in (whose walls still hold all of the feelings, pains, struggles, questions of your younger self, whose floor still carries the weight of the tears that came with having to grow up too fast and too soon, whose shelves of trophies and diplomas and pictures almost seem to taunt you with visions of a past self, asking and *this* is who youve become?) - all make for a rather unique emotional foundation for both some soul-searching as well as some *soul* searching. Perhaps this is the best time to write. When I feel smallest, most open, most vulnerable, most scared. When my usual confident demeanor can rest for a few weeks. When I can simply stand and stare out across the horizon and *wonder*. I wonder about *you* constantly, you know. From the minute details (what color your hair is, what particular brand of nerd you are, where on the planet life has taken you) to the more meaningful (what youve been doing with your life all this time, what communities youve found acceptance in, if youre even out there waiting and wondering yourself), not a day has passed that you were not a part of. We have so much life to catch up on - I am patiently impatient to learn and see and hear and share all of it. Speaking of catching up, I would imagine youve been hoping for an update after all these years. Remember that job Ive *always* wanted, since I was a boy? Well, *I got it*! This past year - after no shortage of hills to climb along the way - it all finally came together and paid off. Oh, youd be so happy and proud! I cried in relief when I got the phone call last spring - not from my own excitement, but for the thought of *finally* having a place I could call home, somewhere I could finally see a life for us - something Ive hated not being certain of for so long. They truly love me here - both in the workplace itself and in the community at large - and I couldnt have found a more welcoming, supportive, appreciative group of people to spend my time with. The old ladies at church will absolutely eat you up - Ill have to warn them to be gentle the first time you meet them. In fact, I havent even bothered looking for *you* much as a result - it seemed so inconsiderate to open that door only to slam it shut with a hey, youre great and all, but Im going to move across the country now so, you know, either uproot your entire life and come with me to do who knows what for who knows how long, or good luck with this indefinite long distance thing. Saying that now, Im unsure how wise that decision was, but nevertheless its been a main contributor to my silence and solitude. And Im not sure Id have it any other way. Ive always believed it to be *so* important to learn to be happy and fulfilled on my own before opening any part of my life to anyone else - a principle that seems all but completely lost on the younger generations and the immediate availability of internet culture, full of people who have all just gotten out of a thing and who have never truly spent enough time by themselves, *with* themselves, to know who they are or how they would work in a relationship. Affection and intimacy have become cheap and easily obtainable commodities, and have all but lost their beauty and power when saved and shared as exceptions and exclusions. What a happy thing to admit Ive forgotten what a kiss feels like! That the experience of holding you in my arms for the first time will be so *new* and *wonder-full*, that the sensation of your skin on mine will be incomparable to any discernable memory, that the intimacy we will share will be entirely and completely *ours*. On the other hand, I worry Ive become far too good at being on my own. It may delight you to know that Ive become known as a grinch of sorts - I keep the world at an arms length and rarely let anyone too close (both physically - other than quick greeting hugs with family or close friends - or emotionally - though I hope and think most people in my life know I am always there for them and have warmth to offer if needed), knowing under that shell is the most affectionate, cuddly, warm, sweet, sensitive, goofy, giving, and loving man youll ever know. What began as a decisive and systematic withholding I fear has become a hole Ive dug myself into and am no longer aware how to get out of without help. I hate the thought of coming with baggage, and hope you find the many ornate walls Ive built around myself to keep the wrong people out to be welcoming and perfectly tailored to the key that you alone hold. I hope youre no stranger to such dichotomies - Im full of them. Oh, the stories we have to share - I cant wait to hear all about everything youve done and seen and thought and felt and loved and feared and wanted and laughed at. But more than that, I cant wait to just *be* with you. Quiet, still, empty of distractions and distance and barriers and doubts. I cannot remember the last night I feel asleep without the thought of you by my side - your body draped over mine, your head resting on my chest, softly smiling in the complete, effortless peace weve finally found after so long - to comfort me. That has been a part of me for so long I cannot imagine it ever getting old. I picture us most in the stillness, in the mundane, in the ordinary. Your hand clasped in mine on a quiet walk through a foggy morning, our eyes constantly darting up to see if the other is looking as we work at our computers, your arms wrapping around my waist from behind while Im working in the kitchen because the thought of being in the other room makes absolutely no sense to either of us. There is an infinite world in my eyes, my touch, my embrace - while I hope to excite you with stories and experiences, I much more hope to sustain you with such wordless, nameless, boundless closeness, openness, and vulnerability. Its been hard without you, you know. I worry that Ive spent so long in solitude, behind walls, lying in wait as an empty vase safely kept on a dusty shelf, that Ive starved off the very parts of me youd want or need to see to find me in the first place - a paradox that Im no stranger to wrapping my head around. How do you create a sense of self when so much of that sense is attached to someone youve never met? Am I even *ready*? Will I ever truly be? Or would you want me exactly as I am, here, now? A conundrum of contradictions, an anthology of exceptions to rules, a wondering wanderer waiting for what hes convinced himself must be impossible. Perhaps it is all as it is meant to be. Wont you write me back? Im not going anywhere, but lets make sure my next message to you isnt another three years away. I've missed you. "
298,vulnerability,r4r,27 [F4R] Chicago/Anywhere | An honest and introspective post about my approach to online dating  and all the usernames Ive used on reddit,1,abdm86,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/abdm86/27_f4r_chicagoanywhere_an_honest_and/,2019-01-01 12:27:39,"**The Beginning** I was a Craigslist junkie on and off for eight years. When I was 18, I met a 40-year-old guy on Craigslist, and his affirmations blew me out of the park. Part of why I kept using Craigslist was that I wanted to find someone like that. I didnt. Or did I? My online dating history isnt pretty. Well, I guess its pretty sad. Ive probably met in person around 50 people from the internet (Ive probably talked to 500+ people on gchat/google hangouts and/or the phone). Though, Im not sure how accurate these estimates are. Ive only met someone twice a couple of times, and Ive only seen one person three times (and he was a married dude that came on my face). Last May, I met someone on r/r4r, and we dated for a few months (for a pretty detailed rundown of that, check out my post from u/timeisaconstruct). Last fall, I processed my breakup with a guy from reddit. There arent any romantic vibes; hes just a really good listener and asks me thought-provoking questions about my life. He mentioned that my approach to meeting people online seems practiced. I thought that was a really interesting thing to say. Its totally true. For so long, these stories have been my go-to in dating situations. When someone asks me if Ive met other people online as a casual conversation starter, I launch into my big story: the sommelier who told me that he could fuck out all the quirks that were holding me back. Maybe the other person would ask, Do you have more stories? Or maybe I would ask, Do you want to hear more? For so many years, I relished telling these stories. I told them as if the stories were a badge of honor. I desperately wanted someone to understand why I blew random guys from Craigslist and why I was hung up on the 40-year-old (who is now 48, to be sure  and I happen to be 95% over, which is a huge deal). I wanted someone to tell me, You are not your stories. I see you. Im not going to treat you that way. And, the thing is, there have been several guys who have said just that essentially. My ex who I met on r/r4r said he wanted to be a model for future relationships, but he wasnt. I told my reddit ex that I was thinking about posting an open letter saying goodbye in r/r4r. I told him I didnt want him to read it if he happened to come across it. Rob, if youre reading this, I hope youre doing well. But this letter isnt for you. I dont want you to read this. This is my expression, and I dont think you ever really understood me. My vulnerability is not yours to have. **The Search** Ive always loved the idea of an all-in-one search. Im looking for a condo/place to live, a consistent artistic practice with a supportive community, a nurturing presence from someone who understands I receive love through words of affirmation and physical touch. And in general living my life in alignment. Oh hey dream guy, youre experienced with film or theatre? And you live in Lakeview or Wicker Park or Andersonville? Or you live in NYC or Portland and I get to visit and see the city through your eyes? AND you see something in me artistically/personally and want to take me under your wing and I can become part of your artistic community? Youre vegan too? Oh, fantastic. You know how they say insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result? Thats what Im doing by posting. I rationalize and say, Some people have success stories. Its just a matter of posting at the right time. But when all my history has been this way, itsjustwhy do I do it? Its because I feel that pang of loneliness. Its the hope, Today could be the day. But life isnt a Second City improv scene. The majority of the time today *is not* the day, though perhaps it just has to do with perspective? Its putting the work I know I need to do to the wayside. Essentially, my inner dialogue in those times is, I know I need to work on myself, but maybe Im at a place where I can meet someone amazing and have them affirm me and we could go on flirty dates and have a long-term relationship. And then I talk to some guy for a few hours on the phone and I get excited about the possibilities  only for it to fizzle out within days or a few weeks. I listened to a podcast where the host talked about new relationships being very vata (one of the ayurvedic doshas that has an airy quality), and I think thats totally true. When I post, its escapism. Its hoping that an articulate fella on the other end will save me. I cant tell you the amount of times Ive listened to or watched *The Last Five Years*. Other than the fact that I love Anna Kendrick, its a reminder that Im responsible for saving myself. A romantic relationship isnt a cure-all. And the universe knows this. **The Illusion of Lack** Itsthe inclination I have for sacrificing what I really want because something is better than nothing. Blowing a random guy isnt better than nothing. Losing my virginity with a poly guy who did not love me is not (or was not) better than nothing. I met a guy on r/BDSMpersonals a few months back who lives in New York. To him, the distance was a dealbreaker, but that didnt stop him from suggesting I 1) Answer all the sex-related questions on OkCupid and 2) Find people to hook up with locally because its important for me to discover what I like and what really revs my engine. And I can see the argument for me to continue my pattern of random hooks ups as an empowered exploration (I wrote exploitation on accident first  huh) tool, but in my heart of hearts I know that isnt the answer. I need to prioritize self-care and personal exploration. Ive never had an orgasm and for so long Ive wanted to put that on someone else. Oh, someone else with the experience will just know what to do with my body when its the right time for me to have an orgasm. No, Kathleen. Its not about finding a person to give you an orgasm. Its about cultivating the joy of exploring your body. My attitude toward sex and relationships has always come from a place of lack, of my desire to have more confidence in that realm than I actually did. In elementary school I chased boys I had crushes on. In my junior year of high school, I wrote a sex column authored by a rat observing whats happening in *Macbeth* (as an assignment I turned in, not something I did in my free time). In recent improv classes Ive said a guy did his eagle scout project inside me and urinated on my ensemble. Ive wanted to be more knowledgeable about sex than I am and sure, I *do* get a certain thrill from deviating from the norm/shock value, but for all the dirty things Ive said in real life and performance, Im just a little girl that desperately wants to be held. And, as much as I want a partner to hold me and brush away my insecurities like soft snow on a windshield, it isnt his or her responsibility right now. Its mine. **The Lesson of Personal Stability** In the ending conversation with the 40-year-old guy in early September 2010, he  or did I?  stress the importance of cultivating personal stability. I didnt know what that meant then, and I rallied against it for years. Why do I have to be a fully well-adjusted person to be in a relationship, anyway? So I searched. And searched. And searched. I posted Craigslist ad after Craigslist ad in multiple cities to widen my net (which, unfortunately, I think eventually led to my account being put on hold just a month or so before Craigslist went dunzo. Its just sad because I lost most of my posts, but maybe thats some sort of blessing?). It has taken me so long to learn this lesson (and I think Im continuing to re-learn it). And Ive kinda repeated this lesson in my post here. I am enough. I am enough. I am enough. Everything I need is within me. Everything I need is within me. Everything I need is within me. Ive never really sat with myself, sat with my loneliness with a kind heart. Ive always run to the next fix, the next puffed possibility. I recognize that the universe is giving me a gift. The universe has basically been screaming at me, Turn inward, Kathleen. Take care of yourself. You are amazing. Cultivate that. So, when I get the urge to post on reddit, Ill go to my yoga mat, journal, or take a hot bath. Ill fill my cup. I'll play with recording dance and yoga videos. Maybe Ill end up posting something, maybe I wont. In any case, I wont beat myself up about it. Its just that I know that the search for romantic partners has damaged me. So often I come from a place of lack or a scarcity mindset. But, the thing is, I know there is something incredibly powerful about building myself up, of seeing loneliness as something to explore rather than something to fix. Maybe Ill meet someone in real life. I think that would really be somethingto be working on myself and happen across someone I click with in the flesh from the get-go. What a departure, right? Whenever a new relationship comes up in my life: I deserve a monogamous relationship where Im adored and embraced for who I am in each moment. I deserve a relationship with mutual respect and giggles and trips to get chocolate milkshakes. I deserve the space to grow within both myself and a relationship. I deserve a safe, committed, and stable relationship that eventually includes children. **The Show I Wrote** For the past few years, Ive been working on a show about my online dating experiences. Its basically all written, and if Im being honest, Im daunted about the idea of producing it. Ive been marinating in this for so long, and I just want to put it out there. So [here it is](URL Right now, I want to release the stories. Sure, theres an element of fear involved in my avoidance of producing this show, but so too, I dont want to hold onto these stories for the few months or year it may take to actually get this show off the ground. I may perform it someday, but Id rather focus on truly taking care of myself. (Is this just an excuse for not actually performing it? Maaaaaybe, noted). Though, if you know of a theatre that would love to have this show, by all means let me know. On New Years Eve 2010, I had my last phone conversation with the 40-year-old guy. On New Years Eve 2012, I blew a guy and then he went to meet up with coworkers and didnt invite me. On New Years Eve 2018, Im going to practice yoga and journal and nourish myself. The reddit usernames Ive used are: u/confehti, u/argylecrunch, u/mangosatmidnight, u/uncertainapple, u/grahamcrackerstories, u/brambleberrycrisp, u/timeisaconstruct If weve talked and Ive ghosted you or youve responded to something Ive written and I havent responded, Im sorry. Im a flawed individual and I can flake and be judgmental. If you think wed connect or you have any thoughts on this hella long personal essay, let me know. I may or may not be in the headspace to respond. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease."
299,vulnerability,r4r,[meta] Rejection &amp; Emotions,1,abm01w,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/abm01w/meta_rejection_emotions/,2019-01-02 08:06:59,"There is absolutely no shame in opening up about your vulnerabilties. Vulnerability is a tool that we use to connect. I want especially men to know...there is NO SHAME in sharing your feelings, desires and thoughts. Yes, there are some backward people willing to reject someone for being straight-up human and choosing NOT exhibiting toxic masculinity. But in no way, does a lack of a reply or rejection as a *romantic* partner does it mean that your identity, feelings, thoughts, and experiences are invalid. Not everyone can say that you are brave for sharing in the first place. Frankly, it is not every stranger's obligation to do so. So you might not realize this fact. But...damn it..Yes, you are brave. You are worthy. You are heard. You are valued. You are not any less of a man or woman. Rejection does not mean that we are not celebrating that bravery, that humanness. Just because you are not valued as a romantic partner by most people DOESN'T MAKE YOU ANY LESS WORTHY. The truth is FOR EVERYONE only a handful will value us as romantic partners. That is a testament to how wonderfully unique we are individuals and how special those relationships are. Every person in the world has just about a 99% rejection rate. Ah. You may say what about celebrities? Yes they are adored worldwide, but let's be honest...celebrities can't even stay in their relationships. They would still fail with 99% of the population. Yes, those are scary. Daunting. How will you sort through half of 7 billion people and find those handful or single one. I don't know. Magnetism? BI do know if you dwell on rejection, stop trying, start misplacing your frustration and anger and scaring everyone...you are not helping the odds. We get through life with hope. Because there are happy people that have beat the odds. We should love ourselves enough to know that we are worthy enough to beat those odds just as well! Romantic rejection in the large scheme is hardly a marker for your self-esteem and inherent value. It doesn't lessen your chance for finding a special relationship. It will not stop you from finding and being happy. It is a temporary loss of connection. It is absolutely okay to feel hurt. Pain is a part of life. Sometimes, it just means that the person does not think that together you two would be compatible. That's okay. We are not all meant to be in a commune, in which we all are married to each other. You know what is going suck more than rejection? Wasted time, forcing a relationship because you were insistent. A relationship needs the consent of two people. Those who enter into a bond should have the capability to assess not only their own emotions and thoughts but respect the right for others to have the same. It means respecting the person's choice not to be with you. No amount of sincere eagerness on your part to be with that person can outweigh their wishes. That is how consent works. Before you can ever be with anyone, you have to accept that people have choice. Consent is the foundation to equal partnership. I won't apologize for those still perpetuate toxic masculinity and repression of the emotions that make us better in our relationship with self and others. I won't say sorry because I didn't create this system. I don't perpetuate it. I don't deserve anyone's anger directed to me about it. I, too, am human, and I have limited time and myriad of issues and responsibilities that keep me from solving everyone's problems. But i digress...I don't want to pull an AllLivesMatter BS move. I want to make this a thread, where as a community we can grieve that such is our culture. It doesn't allow us to open up more often and safely. That many men (and women) find it so difficult to share their emotions, thoughts and desires. That more people can't cry or feel sad, especially men, in front of others. That so many people have to repress their emotions. That we are not free to express our absolutely normal feelings more regularly. That we are pushed to think only a romantic partner will be able to offer that safe space for those valid feelings. That idea is a frustrating thought on top of the odds of finding that romantic partner. I am making this so hopefully, we as a community can lessen the emotional burden of constant repression. I hope that one day, you can spend less time hiding your feelings and more time sharing them with more people. That those safe, close friends can support you through the perilous journey of dating and romance. That they will be by your side through all the rejection to remind you that even without romance, you still have support and many safe spaces to be yourself. So if no one has every told you before, we on r4r recognize your bravery to open up. You celebrate it. We encourage it. Feel what you feel. Say what you think. Don't force others into relationships with you lol. I partly wrote this for selfish reasons. I know that ""it's only the internet."" Words have power. To hurt. I got some nasty messages by people who were hurting, but clearly couldn't see beyond their own pain to feel bad that they were lashing out and hurting others. Victimhood can create as much as entitlement as oppressors feel. In order for your pain to be recognized, it doesn't mean that you can create pain unto others....This applies to me as well. I was tempted to get into keyboard warrior mode and engage in a fruitless mean, exchange of insults with such people. But words also have the power to Heal. "

I dont know what you look like yet, but I bet your smile is a wonderful sight, I just want to make you smile. To be honest sometimes I lose hope that youre not really out their, it seems like no one matches my intensity or really hears me. Are you leaving clues for me that Im picking up on? Is the timing not right? Are you in my life right now but Im refusing to believe its you? So many questions and very few answers. I want you to know that Im willing to accept you in what ever form you come. I know I still have plenty of time to find you, but I dont think we should wait. I know sometimes I can be a mess, but Im sure you could handle that. Ive been getting better though, Im getting help and Im getting better. I really broken out of my shell. Maybe youre still hiding in yours? I cant wait for the days we get to stay up and talk, just talk. I have many ideas and I know you do to. I cant wait to laugh with you. The holidays are coming up I know it can be rough for most, but we can help each other through that. All I need is your smile. I dont know what I should say to get you to reach out to me, Ive been pretty open about a lot of things, but maybe youre waiting for a secret phase to know Im the person youre actually looking for. I like to believe you already have an idea of me so theres no reason to post a picture because theres plenty on my profile. Maybe youre upset with the type of photos I take and Im sorry for that, if Im honest I feel like I need to do that to at least get some type of attention because even though we both like to believe that looks dont matter, they do and people understand visuals more than words. You must be somewhat disappointed in me though because you know that I know looks dont matter to you. Im sorry. If were on the subject of disappointment, I know youre even more upset with me because of the way I let others use me this year. I know it wasnt the best decision but I just wasnt happy so I became a tool of pleasure to make others feel better, dont blame the others who hurt me because I allowed them to hurt because I didnt care about my body after my friends betrayed at that party and I guess my mind just broke down. I care about myself now. I regret going those 3 months of not talking to anyone and not going out, I became a stranger to my friends, the real ones, and even my family. If anything I disappointed myself more than anyone. Ive been expressing my emotions through creative means now. I should let you know that I got into acting, Ive been pretty good at it. I now Im starting to write, Im working on a personal project and I would love your input. By the way Im sorry for being so nit-picky with movies, knowing how the films are made really changes your experience, but I still love me a good cash-grab blockbuster! Sorry if this is a little too long, but you how my mind works, it just keeps going and going. I should stop assuming that you know me, because if you did we would already be together by now. I dont even know how to end this, Im not the best at finishing things... I guess I should tell a little secret. I really want to be a pop star but I have no singing abilities. I would want to be like a mixture of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, But I wouldnt sing pop exactly, more like early 2000s alternative rock/punk rock/grunge. Thats pretty dumb, but someone would be into it. Anyways I hope you see this! - xoxo The one whos been searching for you. "

I am a little. I only have ddlg relationships because they make me the happiest and I need little space because its a big part of me. I want someone new in my life who actively wants to be involved in it. Whether its a friend or a potential partner. The right person for me wouldnt rush me or try to manipulate my vulnerability. I have a preference for Asian or white partners. 30 and under. Im socially attractive to most and have been taken advantage of, harassed etc time and time again for that reason. Especially since I myself, am more attracted to a emotional connection. *Your pic gets mine* but Im very well aware of narcissism and other forms of manipulation. It sucks to have to say all of these things. But I think everyones aware of the kind of messages a female gets after posting. I play a lot of League so would be cool if you did if not thats fine. I want to be close with you. Im not clingy I worry about bothering people. Watch movies together on rabbit, play games etc. Random interests; crafts, kpop, cosplay, anime, cooking, coloring, swimming. Most importantly I want to feel little and safe. "

I dont like to sugar coat and only talk about the good parts of me because I dont want to give anyone false ideas, I dont want to be a disappointment so I do think its appropriate to address the worst of me so people understand what theyre working with. I dont need a pity party, I can throw one by myself. Hopefully my vulnerability doesnt offend anyone and if you dont want to talk to me than dont, I dont need you to inform me that you dont want to talk to me because that will only spark a conversation with a person you dont want to speak to. And to the people who dont want damaged goods, I hope you find that perfect person who is right for you. I never liked labels because I never fall into specific category. How do I even describe myself? Well for basics Im a female, Im African American even though I never been to Africa... maybe Im just American? Idk. Im short and chubby. Not the most desirable in looks, but I have tons of personality to make up for it. Whats wrong with me? Well wrong is really subjective and what is your wrong might be my right and vice versa. To me what is wrong is that I do a lot of damage to my body, I over indulge some days, I starve some days. Sometimes Im sober, other days Im not. Some days Im happy with myself, a lot days Im not. Do I have depression? Maybe I think I do but Im not medically diagnosed, Im afraid of doctors. Whats right with me? I love art. All forms, drawings, paintings, music, film, make up, dance, writing all types of art. I enjoy writing and drawing and just being in a creative space. Thats when Im happiest... when Im in my room singing along to Ninja Sex Party and creating something. I use to be so protective and paranoid when it comes to sharing my art (my writing more specifically) but Ive been open to sharing and some people really enjoy my stuff and it makes me so happy because I love to light that creative spark in someone... I believe we can all be artists! Im honestly an open book, I like to be transparent and very open because I believe we shouldnt hide from each other, I understand a lot of people dont like that... but I wont be deterred. What do I want? I just want to build a connection... a friendship, maybe more, maybe just a conversation, a real conversation. I want to listen to your story, the bad as well as the good, Im the type of person who can befriend a monster because I dont believe in judging others. So whether you reach out to me or ignore me I hope you find your happiness. Thank you for your time."

I won't talk around and call you attractive when I actually don't. Many of you probably now think that I am rude, an ass, or any other word for it. It is true, I am rough at times, even more so to strangers, I am described by others as cold, distant, dry, stern, silent, even stoic, which I cannot disagree with, so you see, I am not the person you are looking for if you want a bubbly sunshine or someone who whispers beautiful lies to you. That doesn't mean I am without feeling or emotion, I too am human after all, however, I only hardly open up to others, never completely and only to very few, if at all. And if I want to feel, I want to do so in a pure, deep and intimate way, so I am very cautious and have trouble developing bonds. I'd rather not have a single taste of love in my life, than waste my trust, time and thought on something without meaning in the end. Also, I am a rather dominant character, I cannot enjoy someone else taking control of me, what I enjoy is making someone else feel safe, being the safe haven. That is why I don't search for anything romantic or sexual related, I have no desire that is urgently longing for satisfaction, not romantic, not sexual. My childhood has been a mess which, while not the only reason, sure has left some marks on my character. The past 3 years have been especially rough, having been mysteriously ill since 18 until almost 3 months ago, almost starving to death while no doctor could diagnose me and I was declared mentally ill by everyone. In the end I turned out to have several rare compression syndromes, meaning my arteries were squashed in different parts, including my celiac artery which supplies my stomach and digestive tract with blood, causing everything I ate to instantly cause pain and nausea. Leading to me slowly starving and eating mostly toast and bananas for the past 2-3 years. About 3 months ago I had a big surgery to fix those compressions, [got some nice souvenirs from that trip.](URL I am still in recovery as the surgery [was pretty big](URL and the damage done by the past almost 3 years also needs time to recover, I have lost 15kg in the first 6 weeks of illness and when I had surgery I was down at 38kg at 1.64m. Right now I am at 44kg, rediscovering and discovering new and old foods I had been unable to eat all this time is very exciting. Still, I cannot help but feel the wish for someone to be there at times, I have lost all my friends while I was ill, I don't want someone to baby me, I just wish I could show vulnerability without anyone else seeing it, someone who might get worried and who I can tell that it is alright, it is strange. It also might be worth mentioning that I am from germany. Now on to hobbies and interests, no, I do not watch anime, I dislike the community and most anime, there are very few I would consider watching, but it happens. I rarely watch TV, especially now that I am not that ill anymore. I have an urge to create, drawing, in the past digital painting (my tablet broke), 3D modeling, modding, animating... My taste in aesthetics is quite different from most people's, and I mean that, I have an obsession with slanky old priests. I am agnostic. Lately I *really* love to listen to SBTRKT, but I also enjoy Slenderbodies, Glass Animals, Purity Ring, Rone, Lorn, Blonde Redhead. I also don't like beards. Sorry. [Here are some pictures I took of myself shortly before surgery.](URL [And here a selfie I took half heartedly a few minutes ago so nobody can suspect my looks having changed much in the past 3 months.](URL And yes, I look androgynous and perhaps bizarre, but I like it that way.

To chat throughout the workday, if timing allows, and tease and sexually torment each other with hopes of the stars aligning. Lust and want would take over our already overflowing desire. This daily fun and erotic adventure is what Im hoping to find. I am in a physically neglectful marriage, and Im hoping to find someone who enjoys my sexual energy and wants to reciprocate in kind. The rush of leaving caution to the wind concerning a sexual experience has never happened for me. I am in the Eastern Time Zone, and work from 8am-5pm with a great deal of freedom to be less than professional during the day. To have a woman actually want to be sexual with me, even when Im at work, in my car, or sneaking around at home would be so exciting and satisfying. Would you enjoy waking up with me every morning, at least, in the virtual sense? Would you like having a man who is always eager and wanting to chat with you whenever he gets a chance? With being neglected, not only am I not satisfied, but I havent had the opportunities to satisfy someone else. I am a natural giver who seeks someone who wants and enjoys all of me. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, a kind face, broad shoulders and chest, with a little more to love around the middle which I am working on. I personal believe that every woman is beautiful in her own way. No matter the shape, size, age (other than needing to be over 18), or ethnicity, you are perfectly you . It's our differences and little quirks that make us so interesting. If you feel like we would be a good virtual match for each other, please message me via PM. Please be wanting to send and receive flirtatious and explicit texts, pics, videos, and possibly voice calls or live chats. I know these types of things are very difficult for others to do for many reasons. I am very discreet and expect the same. Its that vulnerability part of giving up control of your pleasure to someone else that so heavenly. I love the idea of me creating a sexual story or scenario and making your body come alive as you send me visuals of approval. Listening or watching each other play and reach climax is also a great fantasy of mine. There are so many ways Im sure we can find to be completely naughty as we sneak around for each other. I am a very understanding person and not a teenager anymore lol, so I will not start humping you once I see the orange envelope. My main platforms of communication are Hangouts and Skype, but I have kik as well if that is all you can do. Even though this post is extremely sexual, I do have the natural ability of listening to others and being of great support to them. That is what is so painful about my own situation. I am the rock for my wife in these regards; however, she does not reciprocate my support of her in the way I desperately need. All PMs are welcome . Im excited to get to know you and see if we hit it off. If I dont hear from you, have a wonderful rest of your week and an uplifting weekend!"

I am a husband and father in the Midwest, USA. I have been with my loving wife for over 15 years (including dating), and I have been in a state of sexual and intimate neglect from the beginning. Its amazing to me how much the message of wait until marriage is coined and preached without any thought of how to teach and discuss what a healthy, sexual relationship within a marriage looks like. Once a month for 15 minutes is not a recipe for either party to feel wanted, needed, and satisfied. Very rarely does a weekend like this one come about in my life. I will be home, not working or other obligations, and my wife will be away until midday Sunday. I am hoping to find someone who is in a similar situation as me or at the very least enjoys the pent-up passion and energy of a sexually frustrated husband. Whether you are married, separated, or single, I am not looking to change either of our situations. Keeping things in the virtual world, specifically, I am looking to have a weekend affair where we completely throw caution to the wind and explore what makes each other come alive. This would include activities such as simple texting, sending teasing and explicit photos/videos to each other, live voice chat, and live video chat. I have been told I have the gift for story telling and creating wonderful scenarios for our imaginations to escape to. I have also been told my voice is very desirable. I know what I am looking for is difficult to find. Not that someone out there doesnt like the idea of what I have outlined, but the amount of vulnerability and risk is a real concern. It is a concern for me as well. Discretion in all areas is a must. I am hoping to get to know you through chatting off and on through the rest of the day and into tomorrow morning. I am a very genuine and caring man. More of the gentle giant type if you will. I find joy in bringing others happiness and pleasure. The bringing happiness has been available to me all my life; however, the moments of bringing pleasure has been few and far between. Physically, I am 6 feet tall, dirty blonde hair, kind eyes, a caring smile, broad shoulders and chest with a little more to love around the middle, strong arms, and thick thighs and calves. As for the physical type I am searching for, I have no requests or requirements. No matter your age (of course being 18 or over), your shape, size, or ethnicity, your energy and positive outlook is what will attract me the most. I truly believe every person is beautiful in their own special way (cue Marry Poppins lol), and it is the quirks or specific differences which make you so wonderfully you. Please be more than willing to dive into what I have outlined in this post after our getting to know each other period. I am a very passionate and giving person who is hoping to find my perfect virtual partner. All PMs are welcome and will be greatly appreciated by this man in the Eastern Time Zone. I am not a teenager anymore, so I will not jump you as soon as I see that wonderful orange envelope appear lol ... and isnt that orange envelope wonderful? "
316,vulnerability,r4r,"32 [M4F] Longing for that spark and excitement a virtual connection could bring. (Indiana, USA) - NSFW",0,9gnwqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/9gnwqm/32_m4f_longing_for_that_spark_and_excitement_a/,2018-09-18 06:19:37,"Wouldnt it be wonderful to have someone who loved waking up with you every morning, chatting through the workday with you, and doing their best to always say goodnight to you even though they were having to sneak around home to do it? In my neglected reality, the excitement of someone wanting to hear from me at every waking hour of the day is intoxicating. Could there possibly be so much excitement between the two of us that sleep becomes difficult to happen? Would we constantly wake up in the middle of the night, sending each other messages, hoping the other was awake and wanting? I am a very passionate and sexual man, and my desires have been unfulfilled for almost always. I constantly have fantasies flying through my mind as to what sort of naughty trouble I could get into within the virtual world. Imagine waking up together in the early morning hours and being at the height of excitement as soon as you rolled out of bed. We would be exchanging our morning pleasantries, and the flirting would turn erotic quickly. The I send you a devilish message stating, Would you like to shower together this morning sweetie?  Think of the rush of doing such an act. Imagine having conversations with a man who actual cares if you are having an enjoyable day or not. A man who truly enjoys bringing smiles to other peoples faces. As we send sporadic messages back and forth while Im at my desk working, would you want to push the envelope yet again? I have a back, corner office where I could lock the door and do unmentionable things as long as we were extremely quiet. Perhaps you would rather me head out to my car to give you a voice call and spend ten to fifteen minutes making you cum for me and moaning out my name as you feel the sensual sounds of my voice vibrating through your very being? Or, would you prefer me stay in my office, and lock the door, as you turn on your cam to tease and torment me  you reaching extreme the heights of pleasure as you see my face full of lust and want in watching you seduce me with your body and mind? As is most likely easily deduced by the way I write and express my fantasies, I am searching for a sexting partner as well as a friend. I have been pushed to the virtual world to try and find satisfaction in both my own pleasures and being able to please another wanting my affections. Please be more than willing to push boundaries and escape reality with each other via pics, videos, live voice chats, and cam chats. I do know this type of vulnerability takes time to develop; however, it is what I am most searching and longing for. Physically, I a six feet tall, short, dirty blonde hair, with kind a kind smile and compassionate eyes. I am built like a linebacker with a little more to love around the middle. As for what I look in the person of my fantasies, I hope she has an amazing positive outlook on life and brings forth excitement and curiosity of how we can both attain pleasures never before thought imaginable. It is a womans smile, her mind, and her outlook on life which make her attractive to me. Your size, shape, age (other than being an adult), and ethnicity are what make you perfectly you. Please dont hold from reaching out if you dont fit what shallow-minded men see as beauty. I dont fit the Hollywood, perfect face and body fiction of a body image either. I am married and not looking to change your situation or mine whether you are single, separated, or married. I am hoping to get to know someone intimately and find exactly what not only makes you incandescently happy, but also become filled with lust for someone. All PMs are welcome. In my short experience posting on Reddit, men receive far less response than women, for various reasons of course. If you stumble across my post even days after it was originally posted, please feel free to reach out and say hello. The fall months are coming, and the romantic times that naturally come with the cooling of the weather and the changing of the leaves could be shared with someone who enjoys you completely. Have a wonderful rest of your day and week."

You can be younger and significantly more ready to settle down, you could be older and clearly not in that place in your life. To each their own, and I don't want this post making you think ""gosh I'm around 28, maybe I should feel this!"". That said, oh boy do I feel it. I know 28 isn't exactly old, but I have reached that point in my life where I'm absolutely done with games. I had my phases, I did my serial dating, I did my long term commitments, and here I sit being completely honest with you and myself; I want to settle down. Is this recent? Well, I'd say it was a build up. Was I ready last month? Probably, but less. Right now? Right now, I'd move across the country for the right person. I just want that best friend that I can tell every little secret too. My past, present, my future fears and hopes. I want that lover... the kind where you don't ever need to hold back how you feel, you laugh when something is awkward, you are intimate in way more ways than just sex. And I want that wife. That life partner, the woman who will help me achieve it all while I help her with everything. A true co-dependency with a terrifying amount of vulnerability. It all sounds pretty scary, but so, SO exciting too. Let's forget the small talk, let's go with our gut. I want to meet the soul that is ready for that next step. That sounds all good and dandy, but at this point, you're probably wondering what sort of guy wants all of that? I've been described as a huge extrovert full of energy. I love trying new things, going to new places and constantly learning. I'm always trying to find time to read, meditate and disconnect from all the noise of the internet. I adore the gym and fitness in general, and it'd be awesome to meet someone who shares that so we could become one of those cute fitness couples. I love, love to travel so all you explorers out there, if you've read this far, please message me where to go next! Finally, the logistics I'm in Canada and I really do love it here, but nothing comes without sacrifice. I'm willing to move, a lot more willing if you're within the country, but willing none the less. If you feel YOU are ready to move, then I think we're starting off pretty strong. Career wise, I'm rather fortunate in my flexibility and do pretty well financially, but we can discuss how moving could impact all of that. Either way, if this all strikes a cord with you, I'd love to at least chat. Lastly, confidence. I'm sectioning this one off because through my time of dating, I've learned this is one of the most important traits when it comes to being with someone, for me anyways. Be confident. Love who you are, love what you do, love how you look, and everything else. We all have our off days, I get it as much as anyone, but when I talk about wanting to be with someone.. if you find yourself being a bright, beaming spectrum of energy and confidence, than I want you in my life. Well, I think that about concludes it. Hopefully this resonates with someone out there and we can make one of those cute success stories on here. All the best! Edit: It seems odd to need to say this, but I guess we all have our preferences. I'm 5'10 and an Indo-Canadian. As in, born in Canada, raised in Canada, parents from India. I know some people are looking for asians, white, black, so be it, and too often do I meet someone who simply says later ""oh I was looking for insert race here"". Now you know :) "

We put expectations upon ourselves to be someone people will accept, somebody that society will approve of. We all do it, we all hide our true selves from others, and ourselves. Wouldn't it be great, if we all could just tear down the walls, the pain of hiding who we are inside, and show our loved ones, our friends, who we really are? The vulnerability, the passions, fears, weird quirks about us who make us who we are? Except that we don't, for fear of judgement, ridicule, and becoming outcasts. Life is hard enough, living alone with the truth, of who you really are, makes it all the more tougher. If you are tired of hiding, tired of not having someone to be yourself with, we will get along. There is beauty in all of who we are. The good, the bad, the ugly, it doesn't matter, because all of what makes you who you are, is unique. If you need someone who is on the path of self acceptance and looking for others who need that voice, that ear to vent to without judgement or fear, I can offer that to you. If I have touched a soft spot inside yout heart, maybe we can talk, and help one another on this journey called life. PM me."

And I'm a bit of a pervert. I feel often feel inadequate because I'm *just another* ""geeky gamer guy"". There's so many, especially here online. It's not really a desirable or exciting thing. The only time I feel even slightly fulfilled anymore is when I'm doing something for someone else. In the service of someone else. And I'm not comfortable being a submissive person really so that kind of makes things strange or frustrating in a variety of ways. As for the pervert thing? I think most of us are, if we're honest. But I constantly make myself feel bad for being a sexual person. Like I'm not *allowed* to be. Either it's frowned about because it somehow makes me a bad person, or someone *like* me has no business having a sexual side. That's how I feel. Speaking of which, there's another point of self-contention. Sexuality. I don't even know what mine is anymore. I feel like I'm stuck in an awkward place. It's been over a year since I've as much as felt a real *connection* with a girl, let alone had any sort of real interaction or mutual romantic interest. I feel like so many just aren't on the same page with what I want out of life or what **I** enjoy doing...and shared interests is important to me. On the flip side I don't find masculine physical traits or personas at all attractive. I feel like life would be easier for me if I did. Bigger net. And somewhere sandwiched between this coin is the fact that I also don't really care what's between someones legs...I don't think. It's one thing to mentally feel that way but it's another to have it put to the test. Or maybe it's not? Who knows? Not me. That's the point. I'm also overweight and hate myself for it. So there's that. If you're hoping for a real looker you're probably going to be disappointed. I've no qualms with exchanging pictures up front if it matters to you and you want to make your own judgment. I'd prefer it instead of wasting someone's time. So what's the point of this? Why did you read this? Well...Partially therapeutic for me; maybe that's selfish. Like I said I am looking, hoping, to make *some* sort of connection. I suppose my hope is that maybe someone browsing randomly clicks this post and discovers that there's someone out there that feels like they do, and that they aren't alone in it. That would be nice."

I know why Im on the internet looking for people to talk to. Just dont know what Im doing with this post, what I think it will fix. I made a post about 3 weeks ago that got decent traction, more replies than Ive ever had(which was likely just a drop in the ocean that women get here lol) and almost all seemed to fizzle out due to disinterest on either side. The ones I still keep in contact with are great, but I guess I havent found exactly what Im looking for. I simultaneously crave conversation and run from it. I want deep, meaningful relationships and then feel like Im not good enough for them. I know most women arent interested in vulnerability but thats kind of what Im working with right now. I like to think Im funny, witty, knowledgeable, game for almost any conversation whether is be what we had for breakfast today, or your feelings on Nike currently. I like to meet others at their level, and feel Im good at it. If any of this resonates with you, I look forward to your message. "

I want to find someone who isn't afraid of being truly understood, flaws and all; someone who lives life to the fullest and knows the significance of time. What I want... is a profound relationship built upon trust, respect, ambition, and confidence; one that will inspire. Will that involve romance? Or will there only be friendship? Or will there only be mutual understanding and then eventual separation? Well, there's only one way to find out.

Despite multiple accounts of people of all genders calling me good looking and women almost throwing themself at me I've never been very comfortable expressing my sexuality and interest in people I fancied. I think three factors are the main contributors here: 1) It has to do with the fact that I'm a late bloomer who only began caring for how I looked at age 18, so I probably still have a lot of negative thoughts about my self-image internalized from when I was bullied as a child and adolescent. 2) I was also sexually abused at various points growing up which undoubtedly left a mark on how I view and express my sexuality. 3) I'm generally picky when it comes to which people I find interesting. I'm still working on this but I've become leaps and bounds less judgemental and shielded as the years progress lol. I suppose its needless to say that I'm carrying trauma of various degrees related to these aforementioned points, and this is where I think a segue into drugs would be necessary to expand on the title of this post. Its not only my personal opinion at this point but also more or less scientific consensus that various classes of illicit drugs are prime candidates for new psychiatric tools that can be used to heal trauma and other mental disorders. Not only that, but there are also a tenet within this emerging field of medicine that they can also be used for ""the betterment of already well people."" In this category cannabis, psychedelics, stimulants, and dissociatives deserve special mention for their efficacy. I've used them all, in addition to other more self-indulgent drugs and performance enhancers such as anabolic steroids, though I've put a hard stop at cocaine and heroin. I'm not degenerate enough to willingly touch that haha. I don't do them a lot, and its more or less always with a serious intention that I do so. I'm not going to expect you to partake in my illegal hobbies, I only wish that you understand and accept that these chemicals are not only extremely fascinating from a chemical and biological point of view, but also very important to me on a personal and emotional level. In the past I've had many problems with weak boundaries and developed co-dependent relationships with friends and former girlfriend as a result of that, but thankfully its becoming easier to assert myself now that I've developed a stronger concept of what healthy boundaries entail. So, uh, serious stuff aside here is some personal stuff. I'm currently unemployed and spend most of my time reading or working out, but I'm considering getting back into academia sooner rather than later to finish my bachelors and try and enter a masters programme. I adore art and fashion, mainly photography but I'm not averse to more traditional media. I have a bookshelf filled with photography books ranging from erotic art to street photography. My other bookshelf is filled with books, mostly non-fiction. Some are read but I'd say that over half are only half read or unopened. I have ADHD so I get fascinated by novelty and distracted once it wears off, so stuff in there like Kant's ""Critique of pure reason"" and Tolstoy's ""War and Peace"" are more long term goals to finish before I die, and their only current purpose is to make me appear waaay more brainy than I actually am lol. Exercising has been very important in my life since its been a source of confidence and sorely needed discipline ever since I started doing it. I've been doing strength training semi-seriously for over eight years now but in the last three years rock climbing has started to take over. I used to have a pretty bad problem with video games since I used it as an escape from my poor mental conditions growing up, and exercise has been instrumental in helping me get over the worst of my addiction. It still happens that I get an insatiable urge to obliterate my existence from the face of the earth with a huge binge on games, but those events are thankfully more and more seldom. Despite not currently studying it, biology was and always will be my first love. I've had a life long fascination with trying to figure out how this magnificent spectacle operates, despite my current unemployment. I love dogs, always had one growing up but now that I'm living on my own I haven't taken the step to get one due to not being able to properly care for it since I want to give them the care and attention that they deserve. Octopuses (not octopi!) also have a special place in my heart, they're amazing creatures who I've spent countless hours while on vacation hunting for while snorkeling and scuba diving. I've also lost count on how many times I've watched all of David Attenborough's documentaries at this point. I'm not huge on watching fictional series, except adventure time, but I can binge nature documentaries like nobodies business! When it comes to music I'm very eclectic in what I listen to. Tastes range from mostly techno and experimental electronica to jazz to classical music. Music is a big part of my life and I try to attend as many raves as I can. The scene where I live isn't that big but from time to time there are some very good experiences to be had. That said I don't particularly like traditional nightclubs dominated by alcohol consumption and mostly bland, loud music which I don't find very inspirational. I'm not strictly opposed to alcohol per se, but cultural dogma surrounding how its consumed is in my opinion contradictory to what effects the drug offers. There are a plethora of drugs available that can achieve everything alcohol does but better, and I think that alcohol's niche is when it is used as a light intoxicant in a gastronomic setting. I wish that the speakeasy culture that is slowly having its renaissance in continental Europe and across the Atlantic will come to dominate how people consume alcohol in the future. So thats a bit about me. What I want from you is ideally that you're just someone who found any of this interesting enough to warrant a talk with me, no matter how trivial the topic might be to be honest. Intimacy scares the crap out of me despite being what I long for, so just trying to be open and honest over text might be a step in the right direction. To be clear I'm not looking to cultivate some co-dependent therapistesque relationship, I've had enough of those for a lifetime. I just want to talk to someone where I don't feel the need to cover up parts of myself and be accepted. A lot of my interests are completely contradictory to national law and I'm seriously afraid of doing jail over something as banal as me tripping out in my couch while I'm crying in the foetal position from time to time. This combined with the fact that I have a really hard time with intimacy, expressing myself completely when with others, and my tendency for introversion makes it difficult to meet women who I find interesting and accepting of me. This all sounds kind of corny now that its spelled out in front of me but it is what it is I guess. IDK if this will stay up for long as its making me kind of embarrased to be as open to complete strangers, and if I deem it dangerous to my anonymity I'm going to remove it asap."

I'm a transplant from the east coast, specifically Pennsylvania, and Los Angeles has been nothing and everything like I thought it would be. It certainly has knocked the socks off this small Pennsylvania boy. Why am I here? Well, the answer may shock you, so take a breath..I'm a struggling artist! Specifically an actor. I did my training in the lovely city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had a couple road bumps along the way, but eventually decided I needed to give things a real shot or I'd never forgive myself. So I'm here! Hustling from audition to audition, doing showcases, taking classes, and creating my own content on YouTube. Why acting? Well..that's a good one..hmmm. You know, I value the opportunity to step outside of myself, to speak words and tell stories. Through those kinds of opportunities, I hope I can help people, even if it's just on person, in some far away land. If in the pursuing of this dream I'm able to help one person, I'll be very satisfied. That's not all, I swear! I know, I know, everyone out here is an artist or an actor, but I do other stuff too! Please, let me tell ya what else I'm passionate about. I'm an avid rock climber, specifically bouldering. There's really no other sport in the world which makes for such a blend of puzzle solving, physical fitness, and mental determination. Let me paint you a picture. You've been going to the gym every day for two weeks, trying, time and time and time again, to climb this one route. You struggle endlessly over one move. Finally, one afternoon, you step up and just KNOW you're gonna crush it. You reach up, re posistion your foot, and sink your fingers around some rough hold, while your feet swing out from underneath you. You did it! You fucking did it! Shit, just typing about it is making me want to go bike down to the gym right now, chalk up my hands and get to work. Sadly though, it's a rest day. I run a youtube channel based around mental health awareness. In a city like LA, as an artist where 99% of your time is spent just TRYING to get someone to believe in you enough to give a shot in something, it's really nice to be able to flip my camera on and make the things that I want to make. I'm fortunate that my life has lead me to this point and that I feel I'm capable of distilling down the things that have happened to me and using them to hopefully, help other people who are going through similar things. Music is also a large part of my life. I love all types, as much of a cliched answer as that is. My biggest loves are punk / hardcore music but I really do love everything. One weekend, you might catch me jumping around on people's heads in some basement to a Minor Threat cover and the next you might find me in my shower, singing along to Paramore's hard times and the NEXT i might vibing out to some old school hip hop, think Gang Starr or Mos Def. Some of my favorites include Black Flag, Rollins Band, Turmoil, All Else Failed, Vein, Yuck, Pity Sex, Paramore, The Cranberries, Dinosaur Jr. etcetc. You get the gist. Yeah, we can chat about music! What's your favorite? Finally, I do have my geeky side. When resources permit, I love to build PC's and game a ton and of course, since this is reddit, I do enjoy anime quite a bit (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 5th season coming soon!). My current gaming loves are Dota 2, Ori &amp; The Blind Forest and DOOM. I've made a lot of friends over the years gaming and honestly, it's a great way for me to just unwind and blow off some steam when I'm not running around like a chicken with my head cut off or climbing until my fingers don't work right. Is there anything else? Oh! Now I don't mean to brag, but I do have a living room. I know, I know, pretty fancy, but hey, gotta bring in people some how right? I also have 1.5 bathrooms, yes yes, I know, I know. It's rare to see how the other half lives. I love to eat, but who doesn't? Moving here from a smaller city has been the best kind of culture shock and there's always some kind of new cuisine to experience. Oh, I've been straightedge for close to 13 years now, but if you drink or smoke, I don't mind! Just know it's not my thing. What am I here for? I'm glad you asked. I'm not quite ready for something super serious. I'd like to keep things a little lighter, a bit more casual, but I'm not looking for NSA or anything like that. Just some fun, casual, light dates, and evaluate and take things from there. Slice of pizza and climbing you say? Ice cream and a walk? I'm all in! What am I attracted too? Hmm..Honestly, I value intense individuals who are PASSIONATE about something. Empathy, kindness, a sense of humor, and the ability to appreciate vulnerability are all things I love in people. Tell me what you love doing more than anything, the thing that you can't stop talking about when you get started! Oh right, what I look like. I'd be more than happy to exchange pictures in DMs. I'll say I'm fit, with a messy crop of strawberry blonde hair, nice shoulders, and a pretty rad nose piercing.

A little over a year ago, I did a group interview for an administrative position at a dance company. A question they asked was, ""How would you balance your personal artistic practice with supporting our company?"" And that question hit me hard. I felt so shitty for the rest of the night. Because I didn't have an personal artistic practice. After graduating from college, I felt so afraid and unsure. So, this prompted me to start taking improv classes as a way of getting out of my head. I'm still taking improv classes, and something a hear a lot about my improv is that I look fearless. I think that's funny because I'm a scrunched ball of anxiety. Right now, I'm trying to figure out if I actually like improv or if it's just an excuse to not do what I really want to do: dance. I majored in dance in college, even though I didn't have much experience with it and it didn't come naturally to me. I worked really, really hard and my dance technique improved tremendously, but I always felt like I couldn't do anything with it professionally because I wasn't at that level. So I froze. But...movement is in my heart, it's in my soul...and I'm so afraid. I've been told there's a unique vulnerability about my work. But I'm paralyzed about the daunting task of finding a supportive artistic community and producing work. There's something I want to say with art, and I know I'm doing a disservice to myself and others by keeping my impulses clammed up. SO, with that being said: If there's something about this that resonated with you and you have some advice, great -- send an envelope my way. Ultimately, I'm looking for a mentor/artist to assist, but I'm open to the universe. p.s. I really, really want to dive into video production. Like dance films and recording yoga classes. p.p.s. I really, really like the idea of working in a bakery and learning about pot pie crusts and croissants. "

If not, I'm sorry and I hope it gets much, much better! ""What brings you to R4R today, throwingawaythis12? Why are you here, again?"" Well, random internet stranger, I am looking for partners in shenanigans, tomfoolery and general life stuff. I don't know what I'm looking for exactly, but I do know what I am not looking for, if that helps! What I'm not looking for: racism! bigotry! sexism! narcissim! bad conversationalists and people content with living life in one area for the rest of their lives. People not open to new experiences, cultures, foods, whatever! Close minded conservatives. Trumpers. 100% platonic relationships! What I am looking for: who knows? The opposite of what I just listed above. If you love to live life and aren't just living life to live, I want to talk to you! Ideally local or close by but I'm open to travel and visiting. I want someone who likes to cuddle, watch various shows and documentaries, discuss politics and social issues, argue passionately, aren't afraid to be vulnerable (when trust is gained), wants to go out to new places, try new foods, check comedy shows out, live music, road trips and adventures! Sense of humor a must. Dark humor appreciated, bad puns will get groans (in a good way), and sarcasm is necessary. I love music (all kinds), always have a tune going at all times (in my head if not actually on), spicy foods, sweet things and moderate weather. Hoodie and jeans are my preferred outfits but I know how to dress up and dress down and enjoy doing so on the proper occasions as well! Tell me about yourself! The good stuff, the dark stuff, the stuff that makes you, *you*. Small talk is the death of interest. I want to know so much more about you than what you do for work (which we will find out, eventually) unless you are very passionate about it (I love passion in someone). I want to know what drives you, what you look for in a day/week/month/year, what gets you out of bed and what you hate/dislike. Mutual interests are great but different interests are fascinating as well. Codependency is toxic to any healthy relationship, atleast for me. I need someone who has their own life, social circle, interests and ideas but who also loves to spend time with me. Teach me something! Tell me things I don't know I had an interest in and now I do! Tell me about *you*. Physically (because physical attraction and chemistry is important), I'm of the 5'11 variety, brown skinned (Pakistani), short dark hair, neatly trimmed beard, glasses, chubby and hairy!

So, why consider me? Well, I'd appreciate it. I'm aware it's an intimate experience for one human being to share themselves with another. That level of trust and vulnerability is amazing! Both sides enjoying a very simple pleasure, holy shit! I'm not DJ Khalid. I'd appreciate your attention to me and you! The experience would be typical Netflix and chill. We communicate online, earn trust, meet in public, and then I'd host you for the day or night. Eat dinner, watch TV, cuddle, ending with whatever you feel comfortable with sexually. Usually this sub reddit's members meet one time only, but if we get along, then I'm willing to be a worthwhile companion. Describing myself, I'm a North Side SWM, finding himself unable to meet women due to too much commitment. I'm Christian, democratic, read news a lot, slowly binge watching one series at a time like Mrs. Maisel on Netflix, and incredibly nerdy. Finally, what type of woman do I seek? Please be single, not seeking to cheat, DDF, close proximity to north side so I can host you, and intelligent like myself. Most importantly please be a healthy body type. What I mean is not obese, not so thin bones are showing, and not a heavy drug user trading sex for a hit. Just have a normal healthy body type. Can be super athletic, can be chubby, can even have so much self confidence your body image not a type at all. I feel like if I don't put in this disclaimer, then r trashy types will reply to me.

You even send a picture of yourself, as if that will break down some of the digital barrier that stands in-between you and the thousands of other people looking at the same page as you. A couple hours later, and you're sitting there with the same result. Now you try to break it down. You be rational, and realize that maybe they're busy, or their inbox was flooded, but eventual that ever present voice in the back of your head emerges. ""Was it something I said? Is it the way I look?"" The constant self-judging continues until someone actually replies. WOOHOO! You feel amazing! You talk all day. It seems like you're really enjoying each others company and then...Bam. Next day, they're nowhere to be found. You try and reach out a couple of times, but you get the hint. The ghosting is complete, and it's back to the self re-evaluation. Does this sound familiar at all? I imagine it happens to a lot of people, but it's still hard not to internalize it. Is it that hard to find someone that you can truly connect with? Where you can both have a meaningful impact on each others day? It feels almost impossible. I'm Jay, 24 from Toronto, and I'm just looking for someone to connect with. My music taste is pretty eclectic - I can jam to pretty much any genre, but my favourites are post-hardcore, pop punk and rap. I'm a big fan of basketball and baseball, so if you have any interest there, I'd love to compare opinions and thoughts. I'm a dude on reddit, so of course I'm a gamer ahha. Lately I've really been enjoying my Switch. Have you ever played Night in the Woods? It's really good. Also, I love to write!

Regardless, I'm seeking a woman who just wants to have a conversation about their day and how it went. Someone to vent to and with. Someone that is engaged in the conversation with a cunning wit that can be only described as graceful poise. Doesn't mind discussing random topics from culinary choices (foodie talk) to literature. Moreover, someone is not scared to shed some vulnerability in order to exchange some level of understanding. If there is some light flirting involved, so be it. If it happens, then don't mince at your words. I won't mine.

Vulnerability is hard. Feelings are hard. And - yet, I realize that the only true path to finding a real connection is putting myself out there. I recently asked one of my girlfriends how she'd describe me and she said, ""gregarious, optimistic, curious, goal-oriented, and intelligent"". All true - &amp; I mean, she forgot lovable and all, but whatever. I'm 5'6, 140lbs, have brown hair and eyes, and come with all limbs attached. I love a lot of things, but most of all conversation. I'm most fascinated by people and getting to know the root and core of who they are - why they are who they are, what they love, what they dream of, what scares and worries them. And as a chatter bug, I can talk your ears off for hours about philosophy, books (mostly non-fiction), politics, and complete randomness. Quick-fire exchanges of wit, debates, banter, and being challenged make my knees weak. I can be a little bit of a tease sometimes, but it's always in good fun. I also enjoy the outdoors and love to try new things - nothing's more calming and beautiful than canoeing through a national park! Or hiking and exploring new places. You'll find 'Professional Me' working on weekdays and running from meeting to meeting. And when I'm not working - I love hanging out with a small group of my friends, Netflixing laying down in bed while silently weeping to This is Us (I MEAN, THEIR LOVE IS SO REAL), and spending time with my crazy family.

However after 6 years of cohabiting with someone (it's over now), and a terrible Valentines day, I find myself as lonely as I was when I was an useless teenager. My (life-long) depression is hitting harder than ever &amp; it's at least a month before I can see a doctor. There's things I could do IRL but I just don't have the energy to fake it outside of work. Anyways, I'd love to focus on someone else's problem rather than my own. I'm terrible at small talk at the best of times, but I've been told I'm insightful &amp; supportive; just don't expect me to sugar-coat the facts. It doesn't matter if your issues are hopelessly insurmountable or just petty drama; what matters is that I'm at a place where I can't do much for myself right now; but not so far gone that I can't help a stranger (potentially friend). I wouldn't say I have a demanding job, but it is busy &amp; physical, so I'm not going to be able to always respond immediately (which seems to be a dealbreaker for some of you). I tend to be closest to females &amp; LGBTQ individuals, so if you're a straight white male looking to complain about how You're being mistreated by society -- goodbye &amp; goodnight. Other than that, if you've made it this far, you're probably not put off by my age; but just in case you're hesitant to respond (or mistakenly believe I'll be a fount of unending wisdom), I'm essentially the same person I was at 25, just a bit slower, better fed &amp; with many more stories to tell.

Im sure I have some deal breakers of my own as well so I can start with that - separated &amp; I have a young daughter thats primarily with her dad, all things Im happy to discuss eventually just not really feeling it today - have no intentions of exchanging pictures anytime soon. Im not against it eventually...but its just not something Im looking for right now. I guess thats basically it for now. I have a more detailed posts in my history so feel free to check it out and let me know. Ideally Im looking for someone to just chat with day in an day out. Im a fan of phone calls as well, bonus points if you have iMessaging. Some of my favorite thing to talk about are definitely relationships, men vs women, morality, social issues, families, etc. I guess ultimately Im looking for someone to share observations with, to build and learn from, in an effort to have better self awareness and understanding of people/our world. Dax Shepard had a new podcast and I just listened to the Kristen Bell episode (two people I love) and their relationship is so open and honest. I guess Im just looking for that type of learning, growing, and vulnerability. Im looking for someone I genuinely click with so if youre just sending me your ASL we probably wouldnt mesh. I read a new article the other day about a man who got sentenced to 10 years in prison because a man died due to his punch. The family of the victim was upset that the sentence wasn't worst and all off the facebook comments were along the same lines. I thought it was a really heartbreaking story and I just completely disagree with everyone about the sentencing. I don't really have anyone to talk about these things with and I think it would be fun. Thanks!"

I've finally found a nice rhythm to my life over the past year and a half, but I think it would also be nice to have someone to occasionally engage in some big talk with. I crave raw, meaningful connection and thrive off of those electric moments when you can feel the energy of our common humanity in every word. While I am a romantic at heart and damn proud of that fact, I am also fiercely independent. I need to be 'my' person first and always. I also need time on my own -- a lot -- and I don't believe this is something I need to justify or apologize for. I'm not searching for my great love or whatever you want to call it. I'm happy with the way my life is at the moment, so I'm just looking for someone to infuse it with some different colors. Hell, they don't even need to blend perfectly with mine. I like passionate people who challenge my thoughts and ideas, who ask the tough questions and demand honest answers, people who can teach me something new, and people who celebrate just because. That being said, here are some things about me/a quick glimpse into my mind: --I'm from the US, but have been living in a small village in Ukraine for the past 17 months teaching English. I've learned more about myself in this short amount of time than I have in my entire 26 years of life. It's safe to say that this amazing country has taught me far more than I've taught it. --My life motto is ""Do unto others what a sunset does to me."" I think this is pretty self explanatory. --I guess I'm what you would call a ""creative type."" Self expression is important to me, and I draw inspiration from all aspects of my life. I love writing poetry, as it challenges me to face my life in all its splendid pain and beauty. I also strongly believe that creativity is not a talent, but rather it is a choice and its only question is ""How can you not?"" --I am a self proclaimed joy seeker. I'm a homebody who also has an unquenchable thirst for adventure. An irresistible need to wander, to see it all, be a part of it all, and to get lost as much as possible. But, at the end of the day after all's said and done, I want nothing more than to just curl up in bed with a good book (or a good Netflix series; I'm not picky), a glass of red wine and jazz music playing in the background. --Hammocks are, arguably, the greatest invention ever, and if I could, I would buy one for every single person in the world. --I believe the world needs more colorful middle fingers and less polite ""I'm sorry's,"" more wild and less tame, more gut trusters and less bullshit excuses. I think vulnerability is one of the most attractive things a person can be. --I don't understand why people trade their life for money, their money for things, and things for the life they started with. --I couldn't care less about your name, your face (although, I must admit, I have a certain affinity towards facial hair), your size, your bank account, resume, your past, or your retirement plan. I'm more interested in what drives you. What your last 'aha' moment was. When was the last time you said ""fuck it"" and did something crazy? What tiny pleasures have you been treating yourself to lately? When was the last time you cried from laughing so hard? If you relate to any of this, I'd absolutely love to hear from you. If you think it all sounds like crazy talk, I welcome your constructive honesty. Or if you just want to send me pictures of corgis or share your favorite joke(s) with me, that would also be totally acceptable. "

I've only recently gotten through a lot of the identity and guilt issues that many people involved in kink are familiar with, and so I've only just started making friends and other connections within the kink community. This is mostly due to the influence of my very close friend and domme. We met online after I had made a post looking for an IRL domme/sub relationship (I didn't expect to get any responses, but it was something I desperately needed at the time). I had had several ongoing D/s online relationships over the years, and most of these had been positive, but I had reached the point where I needed something stronger and closer. Despite the fact that she lives across the country (and she was open about this in her first sentence) she sent me this incredibly thoughtful message, and after a few days I replied to her. That lead to something pretty special, although we established early on that it was entirely aromantic and open (she's actually been encouraging me to have all the experiences I've wanted to have for years). When that relationship started we were having 6 hour Skype sessions almost every night, but we're both students and her schedule is getting to the point where we'll be in contact briefly once a week, if that. The D/s aspect of our relationship seems to be coming to an end, at least for a long while. This is a bit difficult for both of us, but particularly for me, as so much of my recent progress (I've made quite a few new friends, gone to an event, and continue to reach out and make new connections) is due to the fact that I'm able to renew myself in that dynamic with someone that I'm totally comfortable with. Frankly, I'm having a rough time. The truth is that I'm a really soft person at my core (probably too soft), and day-to-day life really wears me down. In general being in the submissive role, as counter-intuitive as this may seem, heals that feeling of hurt and vulnerability that I carry around with me. So...yeah. It's a big deal for me. I feel empty. I'm far from alone. I have a close friend/cuddle-buddy/asexual play-partner, and I have other close friends in the community, but despite that I just feel so torn up. I just want someone to hurt me and let me be weak and stupid and confused and perverted and love me for it. More than anything I'd love to find someone in the area (Western MA, at least) who would entertain the possibility of talking to me and seeing if our energies/chemistry work well together. If you feel like what I've written resonates with you than I very much hope you'll reach out to me. with Love, --Jay"

I'm looking for something mature, communicative, and kinky. I'm absolutely open to a relationship developing but not especially aiming for that with this post. What am I looking for is someone: - Submissively inclined; experience not required. Playful psychological switchiness is good, too. - Intellectual and conversational; inclined to philosophize and introspect while cuddling. - Open minded and looking explore fantasies, dirty banter, and a whole range of naughty things. - Anything from petite to large. There are many facets to attraction and I don't rule much out, physically. M Me: - Lukewarm on labels but primal daddydomish. I'm not into ageplay but I'm naturally affectionate and supportive. Fairly experienced with much I still want to do. - My primary kink is intimacy, which is to say, unique to each person. Vulnerability and taboo heighten intimacy for me. - Safe, sane, no anger issues, genuine. - I'm overweight. Not extreme, but not everybody's cup of tea. Nonetheless I have good stamina, am well endowed (very thick), and all around sexually capable. Lastly, some of my specific kinks include restraints, teasing, denial, squirting, cum, rules and punishments, and on and on. Again, for me it is about intimacy and creating an experience unique to each person I'm with. If that appeals to you, I'd love to chat. (I'm in Harlem. I can host but have roommates. Can travel as well. 420 friendly is a plus, my treat, but no pressure.) "

The best conversations happen late at night You know the conversations that no one else understands but the person and you. The conversations that are more than just a quick chat, the kind that makes you forget about time and space and everything else in the world.

An intelligent young man who cares to correspond on cultural topics and isn't limited to talking about what we work with or where we come from. Friendship, trust, vulnerability A connection.

The master/slave dynamic in a lot of BDSM falls flat when it starts to seem like play-acting, with the participants falling into roles that are more cultural than natural developments of the situation. It's like trying to tell an authentic espionage story but basing it around the spy tropes in James Bond movies.* I'm very honest about what I'm looking for and what I'm about, so I hesitate to call them kinks. So much of BDSM comes across as bullshit because, in my view, the participants are trying to have their cake and eat it, too -- seeking to tap into something deeper but refusing to fully take the plunge. In a culture where meaningless entertainment abounds, where crimes are not crimes and wrong is right as long as we can pretend we all agree -- where empty consumerism extends even to people (netflix and chill) -- not even our most primal selves are spared. We come up with increasingly elaborate protocols and rationalizations to compensate for the simple fact that it's just too uncomfortable to push past all the noise and be unapologetically fucking *real*. But in this world where truth is an existential threat to many, honest vulnerability is its own reward. I love women -- what with their singsong voices and delicate features -- but I'm so glad I'm not one, and I'm not afraid to rub your face in it. But yeah basically I make it clear that to maintain my interest, she has to embrace her own nature. Dress code, diet, demeanor -- everything. If she is not pleasing, she may as well not exist. Skirts and dresses for ease of access, yes sir/no sir, thank you daddy. No cumming without permission, etc. Collars and cuffs and leashes as necessary, of course. I'm never underhanded or unfair; I cherish her and push her to succeed. But whenever she forgets her place, I pin her down and remind her what she's here for -- as a set of holes to be stretched around my cock. ____ **About me:** I'm very independently happy and honest almost to a fault (clearly). I work hard, spend my money responsibly, know how to dress/keep myself clean/act in public, have a great relationship with my mom, etc. Drug/disease-free, non-smoker, not on any meds, no kids/baby-mama drama. Physically, I'm white, 5'7"", and slim. Toned and healthy but definitely a lightweight. Handsome face. Big green eyes for you to get lost in or whatever. If you like 'cute' guys, I'm basically the cutest. Also, ahem, 6 3/4"". _____ **You should message me if:** You're healthy, happy, and honest, but nonetheless looking for something more. You're not just ""kinda kinky lol"", you existentially crave steady guidance and structure -- serving and dedicating yourself to someone who knows what he wants and how to get it (specifically, you're down with the idea of being a wholesome, roadtripping, snack-sharing, smiling sweetheart in a sundress picking wildflowers one week and a nameless, faceless cunt chained to a bed for use the next). You understand that this kind of thing doesn't happen overnight. You'll be a great mother some day. "

The conversations that are more than just a quick chat, the kind that makes you forget about time and space and everything else in the world. The kind that makes you tired the next morning but make you smile anyway when you remember how awesome it was I miss having that kind of conversation That kind of personal conversation where people are real with one another. The kind that is intense and honest and wonderful. It doesn't have to be heavy or difficult It can be, but it can also be about a childish dream or a silly thought prompted by a forgotten movie I would like to talk about everything. Books I am planning to read, poems I am copying down in the corners of the pages of my bullet journal, songs I came across at coffee shops, movies and videos that made me think Anything and everything. I have so many thoughts inside I love the rain. It inspires me. Sometimes I wear a scarf even if it's not that cold outside, I really like scarfs, specially my long, Slytherin one. I have hot chocolate almost every time I stop by at Starbucks. I sat there for a couple of hours the other day. I loved the Christmas soundtrack they were playing Christmas is my favourite time of year. This old song, little drummer boy has been playing on and on in my mind for the past few hours. There`s a really cool video of David Bowie and Bing Crosby singing that one together. It's just amazing I really like Bowie's songs. Bing's too, and I absolutely adore golden age Holywood films. I have an intense and irresistible desire for freedom, a lust for going everywhere in the world, and seeing everything I can possibly see and experience. I am quiet, but I'm only quiet on the outside Most of the time, I feel very young I am looking for a boy close to my age who is interested in these things and wants to talk about these things too Write long letters about his day, his favourite quotes, his favourite places, whatever painting or book or video or song is stuck in his mind for the past few days (I write a lot too, so if writing is not your thing I am probably not the right company for you) An intelligent young man who cares to correspond on cultural topics and isn't limited to talking about what we work with or where we come from. Friendship, trust, vulnerability A connection. With a boy who believes there`s beauty in the world if you know how to look for it, and who wants us to be dreamers together Perhaps I'll find what I am looking for. Perhaps I will find something much greater than that."

I write, read voraciously both trash and actual literature, blacksmith as a hobby, and walk dogs pretty much for fun whenever I'm not doing school or other adult related things.

In messages I'm very talkative but in person I love to be the listener rather than the initiator. I'm open minded, with quirky interests, and love to learn about new things. I'm submissive, both sexually and personally (although I'm much more equal here), and curious about exploring a lifestyle based on that. Financially I take care of my own, although I've moved back home for various reasons (although I'm looking to strike out again soon). I'm of average height (5 foot 10) with brown/hazel eyes, and brown curly or wavy hair depending on its mood that day. My body type is average. What am I looking for in the opposite sex? Trust, honesty, and communication. I find these three virtues lacking in many relationships today. Honestly, also dominance and an open mind given the kind of lifestyle I'd like to learn and explore... with open vulnerability and a lack of judgement or taboo. A level of physical attractiveness is nice, but there are all types of attractive qualities and I tend to look at your personality first. A good personality only makes you more beautiful to me on top of everything else. Someone that isn't a partier that needs to go out to be entertained every night and is just as happy staying home and cuddling as they are going to a movie and a resturant. Also someone preferably between the ages of 20 and 35. Addressing the submissive seeking dom aspect, I'm not just looking for a hook up but a connection. A partnership that might lead to more. So sure, its sexual, but it's sexual in expression of self and not in a ""I want to use this emptily"" way. It's a primal truth that's there, uncovered for you to see. Like a book to flip through the pages of. As hobbies I love photography, digital art, driving around aimlessly at night, anything horror related (Halloween is coming!), I'm a pass holder at Disneyland, and I have a compassionate side that enjoys cuddle and netflixing as much (sometimes more) than netflixing and chilling. On top of this with all the trust and vulnerability I'd hope at the very least such a woman would become my best friend and if we find more within it than it's for us to celebrate. Let's exchange a few emails and photos and see where things go. I'd love to hear from you. If you made it this far, have a great day/evening/night :) "

I find myself ardently and often disparaged at the current state of the world, how people relate to each other, relationships, dating, *love*. It seems weve all blindly accepted that an *every man for himself* attitude is the only way to go, and we dont even bat an eye anymore at the prospect of using another person to scratch whatever self-seeking itch we may have at the time, to serve as a projection of our own selfish fantasy or fairy tale, to check *our* boxes or fulfill *our* wants and needs or make *us* happy. And weve lost sight of the fact that love is about *giving*. That its not a *feeling* anyone else can magically endow us with, but rather a *choice* we make to embrace vulnerability and accept all of the beautiful, crazy things that come along with letting another complex, imperfect human being into our lives, dreams, hearts, and bodies. We seek immunity against the immense anxiety of such intimacy by pushing it away with casual sex, swamping ourselves with work and projects, chasing wealth, or masking it all with humor and sarcasm. We find solace in the plethora of distractions available at our fingertips, and we never truly look ourselves in the mirror and learn who *we* are, let alone open our minds and hearts to another. Im not bored, lonely, or lacking anything fundamental in my life. Im not looking for a pen pal, a casual chat, a reckless whirlwind thrill, or friends, maybe more. I dont care what your favorite TV show is, where youre from, how much money you make, who you voted for, or how big your boobs are. I want to know what makes you alive, what heights and depths have carved you into the person you are right now, where you thought youd be by now when you were younger, where you want to be when youre older, what you would never otherwise tell a complete internet stranger. I want a beautifully terrifying love that lasts the rest of our lives. I need exhaustive communication, complete and boundless vulnerability, indomitable co-determination, and realistic flexibility. I want a best friend, a teammate, a partner, a lover, a confidante, a companion to laugh and grow and cry and struggle and feel and do and fail and give with, someone who can fully embrace the idea of *us against the world*. I want to look into your eyes when we *are* 92 and feel bad for the rest of the world full of poor bastards who never got to have a fraction of what we made with each other. This will, and should, be the most important, challenging, fulfilling, beautiful journey of our lives. Treat it as such, not as yet another post to send your pre-composed introduction to or try to engage in witty one-liner banter with, and I have faith we'll find our way exactly as we are meant to. Lets be that annoyingly adorable old couple at the park one day. And be glad we found each other on that r4r post 60 years ago. "

A little while ago, I saw a VICE article about 36 questions that lead to love. You can check out their video about it [here](URL Ever since I saw this piece, I've wanted to try it with someone. What I want is to voice chat on skype and go through and answer and these questions with me. You can see the full list [here](URL so you know what you're agreeing to. Some of the questions will probably be difficult to answer, but that's kind of what I want. Finding real vulnerability and a strong emotional connection is really difficult, and that's what I want to get out of this. I don't expect to fall in love, but I'm open to the idea of it and I hope that you are too. But more than anything, I want us to be able to respect each other and be willing to learn about each other and share about ourselves, because it's really rare to get a chance to do that. I know that skipping the usual ""first-date-type"" stuff might seem a little crazy, but I figure this is the best way to see whether or not we're deeply emotionally compatible right off the bat without the usual mental dance that happens when two people meet and talk for the first time.

What I'm finding from the experiences that these posts bring is that each time I've written them, most of the time partial copy pastes, I reflect on how much I've grown, the lessons I've learned and the joys and challenges it has brought my way. I figured it's time I wrote a fresh one. My old ones are not on my profile any more, I have them stored in my google drive because lets face it - I'm far to lazy to keep an actual diary right? Let's continue the experiment, shall we. Right, we'll get started. Basic deets - I'm 27, I'm female and I live and work in Melbourne, Australia. I work full-time and it's demanding, exhausting and I'm good at it. I travel (no, not for work), I'm going to Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Netherlands) in August. I'll likely have the most ""spare time"" in Netherlands, so if you're around and spending some time with an internet stranger appeals to you, hit me up and lets hop coffee shops. If you're not in these places, I travel a lot and we might meet so don't discount yourself. Or do, this makes it easier for me. What am I hoping to get from this? Fuck, man, I thought I knew once a upon a time. I'm not going to give you some sob story about how I am lonely and my friend's are all coupling up. I'm socially capable, I can meet people in the real world, I can find things and people to do no problem. The internet is my preferred method it cuts the shit, I'm all about efficiency. Oh Stan but what if I want to have love with you!? - Aw buddy, bless. I suppose, friends first. If there is chemistry great. This applies to males, females and couples. I am not looking for an exclusive committed relationship, I'm trying to avoid falling into comfortable habits. I love affection, intimacy and love, platonic or otherwise. I don't see feeling in a friends (with or without benefits) as a drawback, in fact a strength, as long as people know what they want and can communicate honestly, and openly while being self aware, confident and comfortable in themselves. So I want everything, and nothing, and I am right now just connecting with people and learning about myself, gaining perspective - It's challenging but who ever grew because of something easy? I have no expectations and what I want might change. Logistics. I live in Melbourne, I'm away August, You're not likely going to meet me tomorrow, or maybe even next week or as soon as I come back in August. I'm a busy fucking person with an established friend circle to maintain so please be able to hold a text conversation for more than a day. Be patient and hold a conversation with me and we might get far. Until I meet you in person, you're not my highest priority in life and need to respect that. Don't be a pushy or needy person, I'm busy trying to keep my own shit together. In all my dealings, platonic or romantic/sexual, I treat people with respect and empathy. I expect the same. Let's face it, I don't have to convince you of anything, reverse applies let's discuss and understand - I don't have the time or energy for unnecessary conflict. Honest and open communication, gradual vulnerability and intelligence are traits that attract me to people in any sense. If you're arrogant and have an ego, you're exhausting, please spare me. Wow, I just sounded like exactly what I profess to hate...sad day. Dissonance aside, I'll get to the executive summary. * Music. Top of the list. Favorite thing to do is sit down and listen to an album start to finish. If you haven't heard Crywolf's album Cataclysm, go listen. Immediately. I predominantly listen to Electronic, I love ambient and psybient. Chill and Chilltrap. Basically, anything chilled out as I am basically a human sloth. I have been wading into post rock recently and am enjoying my time in this pool. Generally speaking I don't listen to much vocal music. I gravitate toward the mentioned, but my taste is varied and eclectic. Music is something that I am very passionate about and I have a difficult time relating to people who don't enjoy it. * The outdoors. Isn't it just beautiful? I don't care if I'm wading through mud with no pristine views because I'll appreciate the crisp fresh air, the smell of the rain on the forest floor or the sound of waves crashing at a distant shore. The buzz of an insect in my ear as it licks up my sweat, the flower or beetle I've never seen before, the orange mushrooms growing on a dead trunk. I will walk for the point of walking. I like all seasons because each brings it's own personality, why fight the inevitable? Tl;dr I like to hike and also kayak. Nature is cool and I also know some animal facts. * Gaming. While this isn't much a part of my life any more, except the occasional League of Legends match, I grew up playing games. Predominantly MMORPGs, I love and appreciate the artistry of games I just cannot find the time to allocate to it any more. * Looking after myself. Self-care is a big deal and I suck, generally a lot, when I don't prioritize it. You should too. This means diet and exercise, relaxation and self-awareness. I'm consistent with a diet that is healthy -for me-. That's not saying I won't go to town on some fried chicken or cannot experience joy without chicken and rice. But generally I like vegetables, meat and dairy without too much processed food or any at all. I workout, when I'm in my proper routine between 3-6 times a week a mixture of mobility and strength. I've been spending far to much time not prioritizing looking after myself. * I feast on knowledge. I know nothing, like in the scheme of things to know - I know fuck all. I love to learn, it feels productive. When I find something I enjoy or find interesting I become very passionate about that thing. I express this through experimenting with it, reading as much about it as possible, watching a lot about and and discussing it with others. * I care *way too fucking much*. at least for my own good. Coupled with the above point this can be a mess. I follow a lot of happenings around the world, and as much as I don't want to I care - I do. This doesn't mean I'm going to castrate you and your view point. It more means that I have a bit of world sadness. With people, when I trust you and let you in which happens pretty quick, I care, a lot. I take on problems and bear them with you. Which is a burden and a blessing. I have a cold exterior. I'm sarcastic and verging on apathy at the best of times, but inside I'm goo. * I usually to list my movies and tv blah. Yes I watch them. Yes I like Rick and Morty. TV and movies generally leads to exhausting small talk. If you know and like Kroll Show, we'll get along. * Weed. It's great. If you have hang-ups with this drug please don't bother messaging me. If you have no hang-ups about this job but are not a functional motivated human we likely won't get along either. * Psychedelics. As above. One of my favorite things to do in close relationships is explore the psychedelic realm. Having sex on drugs is one of the pinnacles of connection and it's something that I would want to explore with a potential partner. If you're comfortable and confident in this space even better. If you are reckless or don't practice harm-minimization, we may hold different values. These substances are to be respected. Additions to you life that aren't detrimental to it. * Sex. I am a very sexual person. Platonic of otherwise I am extremely open about sex, sexual activity and always honest. I love everything about sex, but I also love when trust, connection and respect are honored in the encounter above all else. Right now in my life it is important to have sexual freedom, I'd consider exploring with someone but this is a core component in a relationship for me. In regards to sexual attraction, I generally don't find overweight/large men and women physically attractive and this in addition to intelligence/conversation tends to be precursors to intimacy on most occasions. * Family is not super important to me. I don't want children. I don't want marriage. I don't believe a relationship should necessarily last forever. We are all just here for the experience. * I have no filters. I'm not politically correct. Let's skip past that. * Religion. If you follow an institutionalized religion or cannot rationalize your beliefs it's unlikely I'll be able to spend too much time with you if any at all.

I'm short (significantly shorter than average, if that matters), a little curvy, and can be shy around people I'm attracted to or could potentially date. Trying to meet people out and about has been hard as I tend to get quiet in larger groups (i.e. bars, pubs, at parties, etc.) I'm a very warm and open person but, because of past situations, I'm a little nervous about physical and emotional vulnerability with another person. I'm not completely inexperienced but we can talk about that. I'm looking for a connection and someone I feel comfortable around. I feel like I have run through a lot of the typical options of meeting people and thought to try this in case there were others that want something similar. I have a full time job, and I'm a student.

Being single is a challenge, a challenge that also takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. See, before two months ago I had never in my teenage/adult life been single. You read that right, never. From the time I was 13, until 2 months ago, I have been in 2 long term relationships. I have no idea if that's an achievement or if I'm just idiotic. So this is honestly a challenge for me, and over the past 2 months I've gotten vulnerable with myself and those around me in that time. I've learned that for the majority of people exposing my feelings is generally seen as a bad move, and I resent that. A lot of people around my age in my area would much prefer to sit and talk online rather than meet up for coffee, and maybe that's how I should feel too. Maybe I have this skewed outlook on what modern dating is because I've never experienced it. I honestly have no idea about this, or what the contributing factors are but it's made me cut off from the usual dating apps. I don't need to find my soulmate, I don't even need to find my next girlfriend, I'm not in a hurry for those things, but I feel like I am lacking heavily in the general modern dating department. These are probably not things I should put on what is essentially a modern dating resume, and I'm not exactly expecting any replies, but if there is a soul out there who appreciates pure vulnerability, loyalty, and communication, I would love to hear from you.

I am TheDirtyMailman and I'm here looking for companionship. Lately I have felt a deep sense of loneliness, compounded by posting several times on R4R and receiving few or no responses each time. Maybe /r/foreveralonedating would be a better place to post in my time of vulnerability, but here I go posting again. I am not sure what people like to read exactly or how much detail I should go into regarding my posts. I'll start with a few details about myself. I am 22, Male, primarily heterosexual although I do find some men attractive, I just couldn't imagine being in a relationship with one at this time in my life. I have brown hair cut relatively short, and [blue eyes with dark blue outer irises and gold inner irises](URL I watch a lot of scifi and read a lot of fantasy, but I can get myself into just about anything given enough time. It is hard for me to appreciate some subjects, but I try really hard to find some positive aspects in every subject I pursue. I am autistic to some degree (I have major trouble understanding social cues, facial expressions, and other physical social interactions, rarely have anything to say aloud, and spend a lot of time alone due to these factors), and completely socially inept. Most people say I am nice, almost to a fault. I would say that is my only positive quality. I am understanding and empathetic, and find it easy to identify with other people who are suffering. I am bored endlessly by working, or putting forth any effort besides in leisure activities, and tortured by my mere existence. Living feels like a cruel joke to me. If I could, I would leave this earthly shell and explore space, or just Earth for that matter. If I could, I would shirk my duties and go anywhere to feel free of responsibility and pain for once in my life. I enjoy reading, walking in the graveyard near my house, playing video games, 3D modeling in Blender and other programs, listening to music of many genres (including, but not limited to Synthwave, chillwave, new retrowave, vaporwave, witch house, ska, punk, jazz, and some old time 50s music as well). If I had to describe the girl I'm looking for, it would be: someone easy to talk to, with at least a passing interest in science fiction, someone who is interested in video games, someone who can appreciate silence at times, but is willing to contribute to conversations when able, possibly someone on the autism spectrum or at least someone who is able to deal with the aspects of social ineptitude that I exhibit so strongly, and most importantly, someone who is empathetic and can appreciate that I am coming from the point of view of someone who has spent most of their life alone, and the last 3 years living away from all previously known family members and friends. I am not sure what else to write, so I hope this suffices. I do not intend to intimidate anyone or make anyone uncomfortable or sad, so I apologize if I've done that through this post. I hope to hear from someone, nay, anyone. P.S. To get into more detail about how I identify as a person, I would say that I feel very nearly like a robot. I am very capable of eliciting emotions, but I rarely do to people I don't know. I broke my left hand and right wrist not long ago and didn't notice for weeks. I have no idea if that is because of autism or something else. I am an open book about my experience with depression and anxiety, and my slow decline into poverty. It has changed my life completely, and I now feel as though I have no dreams or hopes for the future. To be honest, I feel like my life is going to end soon. Please understand, I do not seek sympathy or pity, on the contrary, I seek an escape from reality. Someone to help me feel free of responsibility and feel wanted. If you can be that person, I sincerely hope you'll consider messaging me."

YES, YOU. So... I'm very much a novice at guitar, but I can sing. Extremely well at my most open and free. I guess I want to find someone who's also learning, because that might be a better motivational force than attempting to push on by myself, without any friends, really, around me... I've never found my type of people in life. So on my own, I stagnate, and secretly yearn for a connection like that...but rarely consciously realize it, because loneliness, period, is a major problem. The friends I've managed to make in the past were almost all friends at their convenience -- lies and ditching you; macho, peer-pressure mind games; you're always there for them, but they rarely, if ever, have your back...and they never seemed to me like they had any do-or-die creative ambition or burning desire to learn and express themselves in that way. And, I'm a mess, really, at this point in my life. At my best, I can connect and be true and gushing with anybody, but now it's like...well, I'm willing to try, though I've become so insecure. Measured against everyone else in the rat race, I guess I could consider myself to be a complete failure at life. But I don't care about that race. It's a colossal waste. I just want to connect with someone, especially creatively, who also doesn't care about that. We could learn together, teach each other, and draw the hidden depths of our creativity out! I've always wanted to harmonize with somebody, too. I like all music -- including the oft-derided genre of country...which, in its classic incarnation, is actually a lot different from what most people today think it is. I'm even listening to John Phillip Sousa's old marching band stuff because of these ""progression of popular music"" playlists I've been working on (starting from the year recording became commonplace -- 1890). I can get into anything. It all has merit. First and foremost, I love beautiful melody. But I'm at a weird place where my head is trying to find peace and beauty and, er, sleep. I wanted to hibernate because my thoughts have been uncontrollable. So I listened to songs like [this,](URL [this,](URL [this,](URL [this,](URL and [this.](URL But there's certain music that feels awakening and important to me, like...[Lauryn Hill's Mystery of Iniquity,](URL [SURF'S UP,](URL Don McLean's American Pie, or [Moonage Daydream by David Bowie...](URL I'm obsessed with fabled lost albums -- like why didn't SMiLE by the Beach Boys or The Who's Lifehouse ever get finished? The concepts they were devising and toying with seemed like they were attempting to stretch beyond the boundaries of what people even think of as music today. A symphony to God, with songs designed to subconsciously encourage you to eat vegetables and drink water? A vision of an interconnected future where no one is free, and we all consume and do as we're told? Now, popular music's become about side-hos and money, and ""find you a bitch who can do it both ways"". Broccoli is a song about smoking. It's like...corrupted children, because we've chosen to echo the wrong ideas. The sounds are like a nightmare to me. Yes, there's still plenty of good, but I don't even like a lot of modern singers because they're putting on that veil of perfection. That show-biz bravado that doesn't betray any hint of vulnerability. It's technically perfect, but often spiritually and emotionally bankrupt. We're afraid to reveal our genuine selves and emotions, but when we do -- when you align yourself with that method of being...it's the most wonderful thing ever. Fulfillment is only ever gunna come from freeing the channels that have become clogged as you grow up and start to compare yourself to everyone else, which leads to worry. Yet we all have and know things others don't; we're all changing each other's lives whether we mean to or not... We're all weak in isolation. You're only as smart or as together as you feel in the present moment. Which can be whisked away in a moment. We need each other's support. No man is an island. Or something. Shut up, Tom. But really. You blast someone with support and encouragement, and you'll see that the effect is like water to the seed. You don't know what you can be, because today, there're always dissenters keeping you hesitant, doubting and second-guessing yourself. And that, in return, makes you liable to do the same back to them! But find that pocket where everything is okay, where you can be as crazily open as you like -- then your real inner thoughts are allowed to arise. And who knows just what they are or how valuable they could be? And...gosh, ignoring all that -- I just wish I could find someone interested in that first step of learning an instrument and singing together in the name of fun. It's easy...if you try."

In all honesty I see so many posts on here where people tell it all, yearning to be accepted, warts and all. And I get the desire to do so. I feel alienated, not just as a nerd but within the nerdy community. As much as I'd love to list all my quirky, unusual, and generally non-life-script conforming traits, hoping someone out there may sync up with them, I won't for now. When I was a kid, I was homeschooled, but not for religious reasons. I spent a lot of time at home and on the computer playing MUDs and hanging out in various random IRC channels. It struck me that as years went on, I listened to people who were telling me not to waste time online with people who weren't real, and forced myself to keep ""putting myself out there"" - putting on a face, putting myself into situations I wasn't remotely interested in. Through college things were OK but as I get older I struggle more and more to find anyone I connect with in a more than superficial way, and it makes me nostalgic for the time when I was a teenager, with my online buddies, who were (at least in my memory!) light years ahead of a lot of the ""real life"" friends I've had recently. I really miss the times when I could feel really engaged in texting or online chats. That I could walk around, see or hear something funny on the bus and be able to text it to someone randomly like that. I've accepted that maybe it's just mathematically unlikely for me to meet people where live now that I can connect with and rather than expend all my effort into finding real life friends, why not bring back some online friends like I had when I was a teenager :) I think it would be more fulfilling for me. I've never posted here and I apologize if I look like a catfish. I was most recently on OKCupid and had a fairly negative experience on there. I'm only looking for platonic online friends. Historically, I've gotten along better with men, but that's due more to my interests than anything else. I'll reiterate that although I identify as a nerdy girl, a lot of times just being a ""nerd"" isn't enough for me to connect with someone else. At this point in my life I'd probably appreciate aspiring artist or creative types a bit more, since I love to learn new things and being challenged, and I'm feeling like I'm meeting the same types of people in the geeky community over and over again...I'd much rather get a recommendation for a surrealist book or indie musician I haven't heard of than have yet another recommendation for the same old indie title that's been gathering digital dust in my Steam collection for years. I'm purposely being vague, probably too vague, but there's a certain degree of vulnerability posting here and I don't know what to expect. I might indeed have to post something more in depth, but it's a start. I need to be able to have conversations that flow and are two sided if I'm going to have an online friend, and our interests and senses of humor lining up would be great, but I guess that would be something to learn going forward. I would love to meet more people from abroad, if not just for the (not entirely jokingly, I'm afraid) chance for a spousal visa :P But secondly so I can learn more about different cultures and languages. I'm a fan in particular of Scandinavia and the British Isles as well as having a soft spot for New Zealand and Australia. If you want to have somewhere to start, tell me your favorite chemical element and why. I've gotten some interesting responses for this one so why not ask in this context. Have a nice day, evening, or whatnot!"

I wanted to try being more open about myself right away because 1) how else will I find someone I connect with and 2) I want to help make it easier for others to be honest about themselves. Vulnerability is a strength not a weakness. By the way there is no TLDR because if you cant take the time to read through this then we probably dont have much in common. I struggle with low self-esteem, a tendency to see the negatives instead of the positives, a general lack of healthy coping tools, a fear of closeness (both physical and emotional), currently unemployed and living with my parents. I dont like pretending to be perfect and you shouldnt either. The truth is my life is a mess and has been for some time (being abused as a child tends to do that to a person). But that doesnt mean I dont have anything to offer you. That doesnt mean I dont deserve to be loved and supported in my efforts to improve myself and the world around me.

I have a lot to say and I am sure you do too but I am not the kind of person to jump for my phone the second I get a notification. And some days I just dont feel like talking a whole lot, but I will let you know if thats the case so dont worry :) 2) DONT be superficial. I want someone who will ask me how I am doing (and mean it). Someone who wants to talk about more than what TV shows we watched or what video games we played or what music we listened to. I want someone I can flirt with and develop an intimate relationship with (if you are into that and if there is chemistry of course). I want someone who wants to achieve something unique in life. Be a dreamer. Have goals for yourself aside from wake up, go to work, come home, go to bed, repeat. That is so boring and if thats your ideal existence then good luck but its not for me. 3) DONT be rude. Practice empathy. Be considerate of the other beings that have to share this planet with you. Its actually pretty simple. We all have our moments of anger but if your moments occur all the time then its best if we dont communicate. If I dont sound like a complete downer or bore then send a message my way. I would eventually like to move the conversation over to skype, whatsapp, or texting but Reddit PMs are a good place to start. "

I don't really get approached in real life and when I was the one who initiated it didn't go anywhere. I browse r4r a lot and try to talk to people from Reddit. Some want sexual content (whether it be sexting, dirty talk, pics whatever), some want to have basically an online therapist (depression isn't a joke), some want to vent and some are just looking to pass the time and want you to amuse them. That has been my experience so far. But what I would actually like is to find someone that enjoys talking to me (genuinely) and that I can explore the topics that run through my mind randomly. I want to talk, that's all. I want to say things and hear your opinion and have you say things and give my opinion. I have shared photos before and had a spectrum of reactions. From flattery to flat out stopped talking to me after seeing my picture. I don't really understand men and I have been overthinking and driving myself crazy lately. I do realize there could be something wrong with me that I'm doing but I also have a bad habit of being too harsh on myself and taking fault for everything. Sometimes when you show people this vulnerability they use it against you. for example if someone were to message me and we disagreed and I irritated them, I've had people low blow me and say ""see this is why you're alone or insert whatever here"". That's about it. That's the embarassing/awkward/deep inner ramblings in my mind. If I wasn't being fully vulnerable, I would say hey what's up? just a boring weekend looking for people to chat with, shoot me a message :) But instead...I'm gonna lay it all out there and hope I find someone this once to actually connect with. I'm going to bed for tonight but I'll be back on to check my messages tomorrow. Hopefully I won't be too horrified by my post and delete it then so as long as it's up please feel free to message me."

What can I do moving forward? How can I help myself? How can I take advantage of the years I have on this planet? Grief is a really weird and difficult thing for me, but instead of isolating like I normally do, I would really like to talk to other people who have been through similar things or who have similarly struggled. I don't think I've ever really had things easy as far as mental/emotional issues go, but I think I've been privileged in a lot of other ways. What have your struggles been like? What are you grateful for? I'm a walking dichotomy in a lot of ways and it's equally as frustrating for me as it is for you, I assure you. I suppose I'm looking for mutual vulnerability and a two-sided conversation."

The hand holding, overly sickening sweet gestures and compliments. How one moment you were so angry but SO did something to make you laugh. The competitive contest of trying to outwit each other. Those deeply calming long moments of comfortable silence. I miss being in a relationship. I truly do, which is why Im looking for a (potential) boyfriend... I don't need or want a relationship solely for the relationship. I want the person the relationship second. Henceforth potential! But before we go into my wants of desirable traits, Ill mention me first. Im big on honesty. Sometimes frank honesty. I can be quite competitive. Im a total foodie/sleeper. A deep thinker, I can be quite opinionated as well as animated. I do some ranting. Im decent and listening but lack patience. So feel free to talk/vent to me just not repeatively and about everything wrong in your life--That'll scare me away. &gt;.&lt;. Im actually easily scared... I do rejoice in being scared sometimes, it makes me feel, alive, sometimes. Maybe one time a month or something. Too much of it'll stress me out. Dx Im sassy/snarky depending on my mood. Sometimes I'm extremely playful and will pull mini pranks. As for sexual compatibility, Im a switch. Roleplay, light bondage and curious about anal, I think. Im a virgin-and its not a waiting till marriage kind of thing, maybe its finding a good guy, but it just never really happened. I try not to think about it too much. :D So Im looking for compatibility. Be humble, thoughtful, kind and honest. And vulnerable, to me, anyhow. Humbleness often lends itself to appreciate the simpler things in life, the value of something than rather the price of said thing. Thoughtful as in consideration. Consideration to people and what their thoughts or feelings on a matter can differ from yours, which is perfectly acceptable. Kind instead of nice because nice is often implicated with a hidden agenda. Nice guys or be it a nice girl. I'd much prefer it if you were genuinely kind for the sake of kindness itself, it doesn't cost anything. Honesty, which is pretty much self explanatory. And vulnerability to me. Whoever you are, you're having a relationship with me, not some girl, or the idea of me but me. Ideally, we would chat here, to see if there's compatibility/chemistry, then switch to a separate platform, either text message or what have you :D PM some stuff about you. What you look for a relationship or a SO? Do you think we would be compatible? Let me know."

I'm looking for a partner, someone I have chemistry with, someone to spend time with and someone to grow with. All those things that happen when you have a serious relationship. I'm not intractable on it being serious, if something casual works that's okay too; I keep an open mind, my intention is to find something more committed. Now that you know what I'm looking for let me tell you a bit about the guy who is looking. Some adjectives from my self-perspective, mixed in with some more people have consistently said about me: funny, charming, intelligent, considerate, sweet, silly, ridiculous (in a good way), observant. I'm most proud of the observant, considerate and sweet comments. Those are what I value in a partner. I think I'm on the low-high maintenance side, I like to give as good as I get. I'm big into movies and TV shows, I love to quote. I'm also spiritual, though nothing organized, more I worship at the temple 'love err'body.' Walking, shopping, surfing, gaming, architecture, travel, design. I love the world; I also love to cook. Just made some crazy-good chicken fingers sous vide. I'm also pretty kinky, and a freak in the bedroom, high sex drive and someone on my level is needed. Physically, usually if you're over fifty I'm handsome, if you're under it I'm *very* cute. 5'10, ~175 pounds, average-strong build. That's what I'm looking for, who I am... What do I want in a partner? Someone who embodies the things I try to embody, kindness, love, consideration. Someone I can laugh with, relax with, have some mutual vulnerability (this is the whole point of relationships, to be vulnerable with someone), and yes someone to fuck each other's brains out. Physically speaking here... I definitely have a type, and physical attraction plays a role, though I do think everyone is beautiful. All the best with whatever you're seeking, whether it's me or someone else; I wish you unconditional love and happiness. [And what you really cam here for: bathroom selfies! Feast!](URL"

It's that vulnerability that allows connections to happen and in reading the posts on here (aside from the ones that are looking for pure hook-ups), that's what most people want - a connection with someone.

I just discovered this sub a few days ago and thought Id give it a shot. I live in a pretty conservative state in the Midwest and Ive had a rough time meeting like-minded people lately. Luckily, when all else fails the internet provides! So I was hoping to meet some people here that have similar interests and that I could spark up a friendship with. A casual chat is always nice, but I was hoping to find some people to form long-term friendships with. Someone I can count on and vise versa. For the sake of transparency, Im not looking for a relationship, fwb, or anything like that. Just good old friendship. Someone that I could share with and hopefully get close to. Just a warning, I tend to get along with women much better than men. Rapid-fire things about me: I have an undergraduate degree in psychology and Im currently saving up to tackle my graduate degree in professional counseling. No, I wont be your therapist. Unsurprisingly, I love gaming. Im a huge fan of most RPGs and have spent far too many hours playing Dark Souls. I also like some FPS, MMOs, and anything with a great story. I love reading and audiobooks. Im usually in the middle of a Stephen King novel (just finished Duma Key) or reading some nonfiction to try and expand my mind a bit. When Im not on the internet Im usually outdoors. I frequently go camping, hiking, kayaking--really any excuse to go fuck off in nature for a few hours. Just like the rest of reddit, I smoke pretty regularly. Youll usually find me browsing reddit at 3 AM with a pipe in one hand and a bag of chips in the other. If you hate weed youll probably hate me. Im a pretty quiet person. It isnt that I dont like to talk. I just enjoy thinking through what I want to say or how I want to respond before I start spewing words everywhere. As a result, I end up listening a lot and try to give an unbiased perspective whenever I can. I enjoy people who can hold an intelligent conversation and who challenge me intellectually. Someone who is introspective and honest with themselves. I love talking about philosophy, ethics, feminism, science, politics, and giving a fuck about the world. But when all else fails, just tell me about some cool fact you learned today, why you think tacos are amazing, or what the world would be like if cats had evolved to be the dominant species on earth instead of apes. Subreddits I frequent and think you should too: /r/philosophy, /r/gaming, /r/askreddit, /r/LifeProTips, /r/science, /r/feminism, /r/drugs, /r/atheism, /r/ChangeMyView, /r/meditation, /r/nosleep, /r/ELI5, /r/campingandhiking, /r/showerthoughts, etc. Im very open and honest about pretty much everything. I have no problem with vulnerability, Im passionate about my hobbies, I think kindness is horribly underrated, I work hard and push myself, I love listening to a good story, I try to learn something new each day, I set boundaries and stick to them, Im very independent but love sharing. Im very realistic about who I am. I dont have cripplingly low self-esteem but I also realize that Im not the greatest bipedal organism to ever walk the planet. Im big on equality, logic, sex-positivity, transparency, social activism, sharing ideas, and making the world better. Things I dislike: people who think they know everything, people who are uncomfortable with more than 5 seconds of silence, overly-clingy people, bigots, people who cant take a joke, selfish people, etc. I dont suppose what I look like will matter much but Im a fairly attractive guy. 57, 135 lbs, beard, couple tattoos, and short hair. Holy shit, are you still reading? Even if you dont respond, thanks for listening to me ramble about myself this whole time. If youre interested in getting to know me send a pm with a few details (age, sex, common interests, or whatever seems relevant). "

I believe in getting to the core of things, the things that really matter, and then working your way out. So, maybe it's best to tell you about the core things of me. There will be some vulnerability, but I'm keeping that saved for when some basic trust is built. I believe knowledge is the most special thing that we, as humans, can have. There's many types of knowledge, and many people out there who can really grasp one area of knowledge really well. This is how groups get their power. We have the potential to come together and each contribute something beautiful and significant. So it's about recognizing your individuality, but also about the beauty of the group. Self knowledge is probably the most important. If you strive to know anything, it should be yourself. Learning and growing in self-knowledge is an ongoing process that never ends, and to me that's so exciting. It's an adventure that never ends. The more you learn about yourself, the better your life becomes, with the proper motivations to make progress, of course. For me, this introspection is so key. It's needed in my partner too, because I can't imagine going to him and telling him all my insights without him being able to reply thoughtfully and share his own. Being able to grow together is such a beautiful idea to me. People fascinate me and touch my heart. I'm always trying to look deeper and explore the human experience (part of that is just my future-counselor mentality). They have such potential, and such powerful stories and experiences. I want to listen, to learn, to experience this life as fully as I can, and listening to people's stories is one of those ways for me to do that. Then the other part of my calling, I feel, is to uncover ways to help move them forward, to move us forward. I fall for people fast. I love being in love, and I know that I do things much better when I have a romantic interest in my life. It's not that I require them to function, but they compliment and enhance my life in many ways. They also have the potential to heal and validate me from old wounds in ways that I personally can't. Due to the online constraints (unless you had resources otherwise, because I sure don't), it'd be really hard to do much sexually aside from flirting (which is really fun. :P) So, an emotional focus should be established first before going into the other stuff. I prefer white guys who are in the slender/athletic category, just putting that out there. I'm average build myself, with blonde hair and blue eyes (with glasses).

Plus fuck labels. I'm kind, gentle, and empathetic. You probably haven't met anyone like me. I've had an unusual past and seem to be having an unusual present. I don't jive well with many because I see things differently on a fundamental level. I've found this out the hard way and its made it difficult for me to make new connections, so it may take me a while to warm up to some new people. I've gone through all sorts of seemingly unfortunate events recently and as a result I have a lot of free time on my hands and not a lot of people to talk to. I haven't been on reddit in a while, but I heard about all the controversy and I remembered how much fun it was to talk to a flood of new people when I made an r4r post years ago, so here I am. I really enjoy communicating using text. I have the tendency to write out several extended paragraphs when most would thing a couple sentences would suffice. If you want to talk to me and attract my attention, send me something heavy. send me something *worthwhile*, send me something trs intressant. If nothing springs to mind, tell me about yourself. Just don't give me the information on your driver's license or birth certificate. I don't care about your vital statistics. I care about your person underneath all that shit. So tell me something *personal*. Tell me what's been weighing on your mind recently. Let me know your hopes and fears. Vulnerability is sexy; bland, short, insipid messages will be ignored. Just be real with me, and we will get along fantastically, because I tend to not have a filter or any shame. Oh yeah, I'm in the south east part of the US, but I don't care where you're from, or who you are, or what your situation is. I don't want to kik. I don't want *any* pictures of you. I just want to talk. (dictated, not read)"

Self knowledge is probably the most important. If you strive to know anything, it should be yourself.

419,vulnerability,r4r,31 [F4R] Oregon - Complex kinky woman for online companionship,0,3dcrab,http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/3dcrab/31_f4r_oregon_complex_kinky_woman_for_online/,2015-07-15 16:38:17,"I AM: Intelligent, kind, self-sufficient, thoughtful, affectionate and shy. I am not complicated, but I am complex. I will make you laugh, and I will do just about anything I can to never make you cry. I wont bring drama to your life. Not ever. I have layers, and youll only get under them as we get to know each other. At first meeting I am kind but reserved, self-sufficient, independent, fun to talk to, but very respectful of personal space and boundariesoften to a fault. I have a hard time making friends only because I dont want to impose on people and probably miss overtures of friendship from people in my desire to not make anyone uncomfortable. Underneath that are layers of vulnerability, a huge capacity to love, an adoration for simple things, a childlike wonder at the things of the world, and an inner child that is equal parts scared and desperate for attention. Im not going to pretend in this initial post that Im flawlessly put togetherIm not. I see myself sort of like a mosaic. Ive been shattered a few times, but the result of that is something beautiful even if it is made of broken pieces. I am married, but I am not one of those women secretly looking for threesomenot only is my spouse not going to be involved with you, but hes barely involved with me. He has been sleeping in a different bedroom for nearly a year and we rarely speak anymore. I have not yet left him, but that is a distinct possibility in the next few months. However, I am wary of monogamy with anyone right now (maybe ever), so it doesnt matter much for these purposes. I am fat, and I am not trying to change that. I AM physically active, and working on building strength and endurance. I believe in health at every size, and in body positivity. I am a masochist, and I enjoy physical pain in a sexual context. I am also sexually submissive, and not a bratty sub. I enjoy service submission as well as bondage. I believe my submission is a gift that I choose to give to people that I trust. I will play naughty for roleplay purposes, but if I choose to submit you get my complete trust and obedience. I am a Little, meaning that I have an inner child who I occasionally allow to be more outer child than most people do. I love coloring, eating goldfish crackers, watching cartoons, and I cant sleep without my stuffed animals, and I am happier with a new teddy bear than with a bouquet of roses (though I like both!) In Littlespace, I enjoy a companion who is nurturing and caretaking of that part of me. I would say that my Little self is pretty mature and very shy and because I am a successful educated adult with a full-time job, its not like youd ever know that I cant sleep without a stuffed animal and that I love watching cartoons and coloringunless I told you I am a scientist, and deeply logical. Things that dont make logical sense upset and confuse me. That said, I relish stories of the paranormal or mysticism even if I dont quite believe in them. Im somewhere between Mulder and Scully. A bit more Scully but with a true desire to believe. I love people, but I am an introvert and I get quickly tired and overwhelmed if I am forced to be social with a group of people for too long, too often in a short period of time. The people I have connected with best have been exempt to this socially induced exhaustion. I love to read, I love to write, and I love to play video games. Id love to talk with you about some or all of these things regularly. I have a shy, self-conscious, self-deprecating, insecure streak that I keep under tight control. Like many of the traits I have that may occasionally seem to be red flags warning that youre about to be saddled with a needy drama queen, you wont know its there unless I tell you its there. My problems are my own unless you want to know about them, and even then I have a hard time expressing my negative feelings sometimes, so no need to fear that Im going to be hard to deal with. I WANT: A friend, and someone to find sexual gratification withwhether through character based role-play or detailed cybersex. If you just want to be my friend after reading this, then thats fine too! But if you want to get it on, online, I am totally down. ;) I want someone I can be totally honest withCAN, but know that it will take me a while to get there. Ive had a rough year and I am pretty emotionally guardedboth for my own protection and because I dont want you to feel burdened by me. It isnt outside the realm of possibility that we might meet in person at some pointbut I dont expect that of you, so please dont expect it of me. Also, I dont expect photos, video or voice chat from youdont expect them from me. Im extremely self-conscious as well as security minded. Ive had some bad experiences in the past with meeting people in person that seemed fine on the internet. I can get over that fearsometimes rapidly--but I dont want to disappoint anyone, so its better if that is not the expectation going in. I dont care what you look like, what gender you are, what sex you were assigned at birth, what color your hair is (if you have any), or how old you are as long as youre over 18. However, in the interest of full disclosure, I identify as a Lesbian with a demisexual streak for Dominant men, particularly Daddy Doms. This means I am not attracted to men physically unless I am emotionally drawn to them first. If youre Daddy Dom and you meet my other criteria, then dont worry about it. But if its going to make you insecure that I am not going to immediately swoon over your manliness, you may not want to bother contacting me. On the other hand, if youre a woman, be aware that I am excessively bashful about women and it may take me a while to stop being so shy. It would make it easier, of course, if you were already into D/s or BDSM in some capacity (lifestyle or in the bedroom) as a Dominant, but it isnt necessary. Possibly the most important thing to me right now is that I do not want another relationship/friendship where I am the sole driving force and the responsible party for the relationship as well as everything around us. I dont want to be the one who has to pick the restaurant, I dont want to be the one who has to make and enforce chores, I dont want to forever be the one trying to keep the friendship healthy. I really want someone who is self-sufficient, independent, and confident. I want someone who wants to be the one in charge so I dont have to do it for oncenot because I cant, but because I want one place in my life where I am not solely responsible for everything. I want someone who wants to take care of menot because Im needybecause Im not--but because they ENJOY TAKING CARE OF ME. There are sides of me I dont currently allow anyone to see, and I want someone who wants to see those pieces. Someone who will find it endearing when I want to color in a coloring book, or clap my hands and giggle like a child. But also someone who will be able to keep up with me in a conversation about social justice, books or video games. Liking science, medicine or animals is also a bonus. There are a few things you should know about me before you contact me. Firstly, if you dont see yourself as a Feminist, were not going to get along. If you think being LBGT or Q (or some combination thereof) is gross, were definitely not going to get along. If you have a problem with me being not only fat, but striving to be comfortable with my body size and focusing on being healthy with no goal to lose weight, then were not going to get along. If you have a fat fetish, were probably not going to get alongI want you to like the fat because its attached to me, not like me because Im attached to the fat. If you think its fucked up that I am a masochist, and enjoy a variety of other kinks involving mutual consent between two adults (such as ageplay, BDSM, etc.) then were probably not going get along. If you are a man and it is going to bother you that I am not going to be physically attracted to you without working at it, youre probably better off not contacting me. If youre looking for monogamy only, I probably cant give it to youit isnt impossible, but I cant see myself making a one person commitment to anyone any time soon, especially given Im married and I am not certain I will be leaving him. If you are a Dominant, then this is a bit more negotiable--if I choose to submit to you, I don't think it's feasible for me at this point to 'belong' to more than one person. Drop me an orange envelope if youve bothered to read this far and arent scared off. Id be interested in Skype (without voice/video) and possibly Kik at first."

It was a first-time occurrence, and caught me by total surprise, but thankfully I came to my senses relatively swiftly. Anyway, aside from indoctrinating me into the bizarre psychological repercussions of a strange, modern-day phenomenon, there was a silver-lining to the whole thing: it made me realize how profoundly I miss and need emotional connection. I'm somewhat inured to loneliness. I've grappled with pretty debilitating anxiety and depression for the entirety of my adult life. I was an academically gifted student and have shown flashes of tremendous promise, yet a lot of life's taken-for-granted milestones have been lost in that whole maelstrom. Still, I'm grateful for what there has been -- I've experienced life in three different countries on two different continents; I managed to stake out a small career as a freelance writer and was published internationally before 21; I am close with my brothers, and co-habit with two dogs who I am crazy for. Unfortunately, I spend a lot of time feeling like I'm living at a fraction of my potential, which perpetuates feelings of being unworthy of others' company/love. I have a handful of close friends here, but there isn't the closeness and vulnerability I want. I'm not looking for someone to sink all my hopes into; I'm relatively independent and have found ways to effectively capitalize on the energy I have. But I think it's hard to persist alone, in a kind of vacuum, on a day-to-day basis, without any sense that might change. I know that what I'm looking for isn't futile because I've experienced it: friends/relationships with compassionate, sober, intelligent girls, yet with the humility and vulnerability that comes from having been through something. I know that shared pain isn't an automatic bypass to friendship. And I know that this is a little bit overwrought, but it's 3am and r4r brings out my confessional side. It would probably help if we had some shared interests: I'm mostly into art-stuff, music, some TV, psychology/neuroscience (for self-help purposes, mostly), Howard Stern is a guilty pleasure, and I spent a lot of my time pursuing an interest in photography; I also like occasional, recreational drinking/drug use. It would also help if you had a skewed sense-of-humor, were over 25, socially anxious (but not debilitatingly so), and were mostly left-of-center. I'm not crazy about the idea of strictly-online relationships, though would open this up to anyone outside of Melbourne if you thought there was some chance we would click. But at the same time, if you are in Melbourne, I don't feel any tremendous urgency to meet and would be happy to spend time exchanging emails first, or maybe even Skyping .. I think that covers it, for now .. "

I believe in getting to the core of things, the things that really matter, and then working your way out. So, maybe it's best to tell you about the core things of me. There will be some vulnerability, but I'm keeping that saved for when some basic trust is built. There will also be more shallow things at the end (since we're working our way to the outside.) I believe knowledge is the most special thing that we, as humans, can have. There's many types of knowledge, and many people out there who can really grasp one area of knowledge really well. This is how groups get their power. We have the potential to come together and each contribute something beautiful and significant. So it's about recognizing your individuality, but also about the beauty of the group. Self knowledge is probably the most important. If you strive to know anything, it should be yourself. Learning and growing in self-knowledge is an ongoing process that never ends, and to me that's so exciting. It's an adventure that never ends. The more you learn about yourself, the better your life becomes, with the proper motivations to make progress, of course. For me, this introspection is so key. It's needed in my partner too, because I can't imagine going to him and telling him all my insights without him being able to reply thoughtfully and share his own. Being able to grow together is such a beautiful idea to me. People fascinate me and touch my heart. I'm always trying to look deeper and explore the human experience (part of that is just my future-counselor mentality). They have such potential, and such powerful stories and experiences. I want to listen, to learn, to experience this life as fully as I can, and listening to people's stories is one of those ways for me to do that. Then the other part of my calling, I feel, is to uncover ways to help move them forward, to move us forward. I fall for people fast. I love being in love, and I know that I do things much better when I have a romantic interest in my life. It's not that I require them to function, but they compliment and enhance my life in many ways. They also have the potential to heal and validate me from old wounds in ways that I personally can't.

This fantasy involves a very thorough checkup, and is not just about sex, but about acting out the fantasy. If you are turned on by the idea of a realistic doctor-patient role play, involving sensual exploration, inspection and examination of every part of your body, this is for you. I would also want to check various sensations, including your reaction to the use of various toys. If you are submissive or have fantasies of vulnerability, it is a plus. I'm a clean, white, professional male in good physical shape. Be ready to be a dutiful patient who follows directions. I tend to be dominant, and you will probably find your exam intense if you've never done it before, but also exciting and liberating. I also have a caring side that might replicate what you'd get from a medical professional."

Creep no.1 reporting for duty! You know how *close* we'd have to be for you to let me touch your face? Or even mines... Id have to trust you not to pinch my nose/cheeks and or slap me. Actually, I would have to be OKAY with you doing that. That... That's idek! Actually, I DO know, and if that's so, we need to get to knowing each other, like... Right now. So herro. This is me, well a side of me. I'm on my sociable side but usually I'm easily irritable. That doesn't mean tread lightly but tread... Intelligence like. Don't say anything too stupid else I won't be responsible for what I end up saying---Whaaaat. Well, you see, you say something stupid, I say something smart. We balance, :). Slightly joking but not... Really? Fact is, I'm constantly trying to make myself a better person. I can laugh *and* cry at myself. I do things that I probably shouldn't and should do. I'm a fantastic listener, very sympathetic and possibly empathetic too. I try my hardest to be helpful and imagine as if I were in your shoes... However, some situations are unshoeable. Some, I've been in before. I kind of hate listening though... Because I like to help out, I use a lot of time and effort to come up with a solution and most situations people don't want to fix it they just want to bitch. I'm down with that but I seriously want to hit something when people bitch about the same shit over and over. I'm very honest, sometimes too honest so it comes off as rude. And before I go into too many details, Ill move onto the next topic. What I am looking for in a person is seduction. Not necessarily you to me or vice versa but that we both are open to ideas to a sexy seduction. Now before I get flooded with nude selfies, calm the fuck down and listen. When I say sexy, I'm talking excitement. Arousal, not necessarily sexual--possible, but in most cases, it's a feeling I attribute to yearning and or giddy hopefulness/restlessness. Example; food. Food literally shuts me up. I can't get enough and it IS sexy. So sexy. Seduction is... Flying. Closing one's eyes and letting another person lead them into the wonderful world of Disney or something said other person feels passionate about. Now you don't have to like Disney or even food, but that you are open to it... Hey, you're already looking pretty sexy to me. What I'm looking for a person is attentiveness and listening capability. Good news; I'm only clingy when I'm crazy in love and in most cases I'm too adorable to ignore. But yeah. I want you to listen. Not all the time but when I communicating with you. I am super shy, usually keeping my feelings/thoughts suppressed and as a result I struggle with expressing. I do have a slight speech impediment and I get super conscious of that too but that's not as bad as it once was :). I'm looking for vulnerability. Now it doesn't have to be now--I'd actually prefer not now-- but a few months down the road, years, whatever. I do want it though, vulnerability, to *me*. I want someone who will be at home with playing with *me*, talking with *me*, eating with *me*, sleeping with *me*, kissing *me*. Someone whose vulnerable to me. I don't want to be a doll or princess you put on the shelf, either out of convenience, or even idolizing. Admiration, respect, equality, is what I demand. Amongst other things... I'm not asking to be the only girl, but to be something in your life. Something meaningful. Wow Op! You sound so legit, what's to say the likelihood of this is something probable? Well... Nothing. Absolutely nothing. There are no guarantees in life. None. And as ominous as that sounds, that also means that the fucked up shit that's happening right now (work, dumbasses, puberty, poverty, etc) is *not* going to last. You win some, you lose some. I wrote this post because I'm hopeful for someone. Someone like I said. Hope is one of the most conflicting words ever. It's slightly masochistic, actually. But tell me, are you hopeful?"

I'm looking, at first, for some conversation, a little friendship, but I am, ideally, looking for someone to have something a little more with. Potentially, that'd be some kind of relationship, but I'm not planning on rushing or forcing anything. If it happens, it happens, I guess. Here's some things that may or may not be true about me(but actually are): -I'm blind in my right eye. -I have a pilot's license for StarOcean. -I once won a poetry competition with a poem about roses and vampires. -I love to read, and have over 800 books. -I have three blogs. -I brew my own Kombucha tea, and I love making my own jams and pickles and stuff, too. -I love cooking, and baking, and any kind of kitchen concoctions, and I love sharing recipes and ideas- though don't ask me about the pasta incident! -I like lots of music, but I'm a huge fan of anything swing/big band/jazz-sounding, both classic (from the fifties/sixties, etc) or modern day. -I watch way too much tv and stuff for my own good (oh, the life of a spinster!), but I prefer comedies, action films, rom-coms, dramadies, stuff like that. I'm not a huge fan of anything too intense, or too gory- so horror films are not my favorite! I do have Skype, but I pretty much use it strictly as a messenger. I also have AIM (because yes, I'm old-school), email, and...that's about it, I think. We can exchange photos later on if we actually chat for a little while. Yeppers, yes I am sure indeed an lesbian! A good friend would be grand but I am hoping for a possible future girlfriend! Please keep that in your head if you message me. &lt;3 Please PM me a picture of yourself, location, and a brief description of what you're looking for. Vulnerability is the essence of romance. It's the art of being uncalculated, the willingness to look foolish, the courage to say, 'This is me, and I'm interested in you enough to show you my flaws with the hope that you may embrace me for all that I am but, more important, all that I am not. &lt;3 I'm a hopeless romantic and I believe that you can find love in many different places and be very conflicted. I've discovered as I've grown up that life is far more complicated than you think it is when you're a kid. It isn't just a straightforward fairytale. Falling in love, romance, matters of the heart - when you fall in love, on some biochemical level you know there is a chance it won't work out. It's ingrained in us that if you take such an enormous risk on someone with your heart that it might not pay off. I gamble all my chips and I might actually lose everything. :) I am willing to take chances to maybe meet a real cool girl someday. We can just simply see where things go when we talk. xD Sorry that this is pretty long! So, let's do this, shall we? :D"

Regarding music alternative rock tunes take up most of my Spotify. Big TSwift fan. Expanding my arsenal is always exciting. I like the idea of sending each other a song each day and reporting back on what we thought of it. Heroes and powers usually gets comical. Spider-Man and The Flash are my favorites.

Another thing I look for is someone who's caring. I'm a very caring guy and I would like my significant other to be just as caring because I think having a caring person is important in a relationship. As far as looks go, I dont really have a ""type"". That being said, I'm not going to say looks don't matter. I would really appreciate it if you would send a pic in your message. If you get to see me I'd love to see you! One last thing, I tend to click well with nerdier people. However, even if you don't hit every checkmark here I really do encourage you to please message me if you're interested. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

I am a 19-year-old high school graduate who is attending college in the fall, sadly its all online, which is a major bummer. A little about me: I wrestled in high school for three years, until I did something stupid. I am very interested in robotics and computers. Basically technology in general. I will be studying network administration on a pathway to cybersecurity. I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and a stupid smile to go with it. With all this COVID stuff, my life hasn't really stopped, but I am missing the social aspect of my life, which keeps me from thinking dark shit or doing something stupid, not like I'm gonna do anything anyways. I'm seeking a potential relationship, one where we both are honest with each other and admit when we are annoyed, feeling angry, and or need to talk about stuff. I don't exactly have a preference in a person. A Decent person is good enough for me. Thanks!"

I am 24yo from Maryland. I am here to look for someone I could build a friendship with that could turn into something more. I believe that the best partner is the one who is your friend first. So heres a few things about me. - I am currently in college completing my degree in Cybersecurity. - I work as a nanny to two sweet toddlers. I love what I do and enables me to keep my little apartment and do what I love. - I want to travel the world and enjoy my youth before settling down. - I do believe in marriage and I want to have a big family. - I believe that trust, communication and accountability is important in a relationship. - My sense of humor is pretty great, albeit it can be dark most of the time. - I have my own struggles but I am working through them. I dont need anybody to fix me, just hold my hand and be there for me. - I love country music but I do enjoy all kinds of music. - I love horror movies but can never watch them alone. - I love to game on my PS4, mostly shooter games. - Im learning how to play the guitar. - My political leanings are pretty moderate, leaning left. - I can cook and bake. I love to bake more than cook but Im pretty good at both, if I do say so myself. - Im a hopeless romantic. I love sweet surprises and random love notes/letters. I love forehead kisses and being hugged from behind. Im very simple in this area. What Im looking for? Im looking for someone who has the same goals and values as me. I want more in life than what I can imagine. I guess you could say Im a dreamer but I also work very hard to achieve my dreams. I dont believe in settling when there are greater things out there. I also do think physical attraction is important but not everything. I am not in a rush for anything. I just want to take it as slow as possible and really get to know each other. Im tired of being ghosted and being abandoned. Im tired of the cycle of getting my hopes up only for someone to just crush it. Its already a tough world out there, no need to make it tougher. Anyways if youre interested, DM me a bit about you (where youre from, your age, an interesting bit, etc.) and a pic. Id prefer for you to be older than me and maybe the same time zone. Physically Im more into men with a little meat in their bones and a lot taller than me (Im 54 for note). Hope to hear from you soon and be safe! Heres me: URL"

I'm currently in Latin America, waiting for borders to reopen. I'm looking for someone adventurous who likes traveling and trying new things. Generally, I get along best with people working in either cybersecurity or finance since we tend to have more in common. If you're not working in those industries, it's no big deal. As for myself, I work in corporate finance at an established startup. I'm the type of person who'll try just about anything once (like scorpion). I've traveled all my life and have recently started accelerating the process. At minimum, I want to visit every continent in the world before I turn 30. If I have time, I'd like to visit every UN member nation/dependency but since I plan on attending grad school and settling down in the next few years, that goal might be a bit of a stretch. One thing that I enjoy doing that doesn't seem very common is attending large subcultural events. I'm talking about things like Def Con, Burning Man, Mardi Gras, etc. Of those events I've only attended Def Con (twice), but the rest will follow in the very near future. The next major event coming up is Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro next February. I'm pretty open to a lot of things (like psychedelics), but I rarely drink and almost never smoke. Other details about me: * 5' 10, Asian * B.S. in Math/Econ * Likes Starcraft * Reads, Snowboards, and Works for Fun (my work changes daily, so I never know what I'll get) * Speaks some French/Chinese; Learning Spanish/Portuguese * Thinking about an MBA * Studying for the CFA/FRM exams"

You can see me [here](URL As far as hobbies go, I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I'm all over the place but right now I've been playing a lot of league, csgo, ark, rust, siege, gta, rocket league, and a few others. It's definitely a plus if you play video games, but not a deal breaker at all. I know most females don't play video games and there's plenty of other stuff we could connect on. I'm a pretty big history buff and I love collecting antique firearms and war memorabilia. Politics, history, space and science are some of my favorite subjects. Be careful or I'll talk your ear off about any of them. I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR: I guess I'm a bit more picky than I expected? The biggest deal-breaker for me is personality. I'd really like a fun girl who isn't all too serious but I also want someone who can have one of those deep intellectual conversations late at night that blow our minds before we go to bed. Another thing I look for is someone who's caring. I'm a very caring guy and I would like my significant other to be just as caring because I think having a caring person is important in a relationship. As far as looks go, I dont really have a ""type"". That being said, I'm not going to say looks don't matter. I would really appreciate it if you would send a pic in your message. If you get to see me I'd love to see you! One last thing, I tend to click well with nerdier people. However, even if you don't hit every checkmark here I really do encourage you to please message me if you're interested. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

No but seriously, I love talking about anything or nothing and love agreeing to disagree. It's just so neat how I can absolutely miss someone's perspective and so I love people who want to *get into* stuff so whole new worlds open up for me. I'm also very much a devil's advocate. * I love sports, my mains are Judo for work days and mountainbiking for weekends. I love the thrill both give you, I swear it gives me more energy instead of making me more tired! * Also a student, I study cybersecurity (or for the people who get bored by it -which is totally fair- ""computer stuff"") * I like listening to metal but that doesn't mean you have to as well, even though that'd be cool! * I'm a gamer, but like with metal I don't need you to play games too, but it'd be cool (I play on PC). Oh and I the physical stuff, if it matters at all. * quite pale because I'm only outside if I'm doing something outside, it's hard for me to not be doing anything * blonde hair, short * blue eyes * I'm in shape, one of those lucky bastards who gets to eat pretty much *whatever* without penalty because of some metabolism stuff or something. * I'm 178cm tall but I have no clue what that's in feet.

I like to game, I have Xbox, ps4 and PC, but haven't played all to often up until now. I have also picked up streaming. I have a lot of other interests and hobbies but those can be revealed later. I'm a pretty comedic guy, you know they guy that makes everyone laugh while he is dead inside, like that. But I also have a softer kind side that I don't really get to show because of a lack of having a significant other. At points I can be abrasive or have rough edges but I think that's due to the way I grew up or how things have planned out in my life. I'm sure those can be solved by some affection. Anyways.

I'm a bit of an oddball so the traditional dating scene isn't a good fit. For example, I rarely drink, relocate frequently, and don't care much for pop culture. Instead, I spend my time gaming, chatting with eccentrics, or researching whatever's caught my interest (usually something related to cybersecurity, finance, insurance, psychology, or tech) That being said, I'm extroverted and would really like to meet new people. I'm location flexible since if I like you enough, I'll visit. Currently, I'm hanging out in Latin America, but I'll soon make my way to Europe or back to the states -- it depends more on Covid than myself. For the gamers, I've recently been playing a lot of League of Legends, DotA, and Starcraft II. I'd like to get into Rust."

If you want to know more about me, please contact me and ask me anything, nothing is off limits and I'll answer any question, save for questions that might endanger my security. Pics are available upon request. I suppose I'm just taking a new approach and I'm just tired of fake pleasantries. I want to make a real connection with someone and share my vulnerable self. I would strongly prefer that you be local so we can see one another in person. \-I'm 5'11"" and 249 lbs and I come with a beard. I'm dieting for my health and to feel more attractive. I hit the gym for strength training and run in my neighborhood, but I sometimes have trouble keeping that going consistently. \-I am Agnostic and liberal in my politics. I tend to approach issues with logic and reason but I am more emotional in my personal life and tend to make my plans around what my mood is and what my desires are. I always try to be compassionate and understanding with people. \-I work as a PC Tech and I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. My career is very important to me and I am committed to succeeding. I have my shit together career wise and financially. \-I have hang-ups. It's been a while for me since my last relationship so I come with some hang-ups. I'm not really interested in being a father or a father figure, likely ever. \-I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I need a man and a woman to feel satisfied, it doesn't mean I'm a sex maniac that will cheat at the drop of a hat. At the moment I'm only really interested in dating women, my interest in men is limited, I just wanted to put it out there that I'm bi. \-Despite how this profile might make me sound I love to laugh and have a great time with my friends. I'm just tired of being single and my lack of success has left my expectations low. Standards are high, just not expectations. I enjoy being a cut-up with people I'm familiar and comfortable with. I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I watch a lot of YouTube. I'm not above bad sex jokes. I have an interest in pursuing Cooking, Fencing, and Archery. Drama too, but I get stagefright easily. \-I love strong women (physically, mentally, strong will, decisive) and sometimes I want to lead and take care of someone, but other times I want to be led around and patted on the head. I love to snuggled and being physically close, but more than anything I am looking for emotional closeness and warmth."

I am looking for that someone that is the missing piece of my life and hopefully I am their piece as well. If you want to know more about me, please contact me and ask me anything, nothing is off limits and I'll answer any question, save for questions that might endanger my security. Pics are available upon request. I suppose I'm just taking a new approach and I'm just tired of fake pleasantries. I want to make a real connection with someone and share my vulnerable self. I would strongly prefer that you be local so we can see one another in person. \-I'm 5'11"" and 249 lbs and I come with a beard. I'm dieting for my health and to feel more attractive. I hit the gym for strength training and run in my neighborhood, but I sometimes have trouble keeping that going consistently. \-I am Agnostic and liberal in my politics. I tend to approach issues with logic and reason but I am more emotional in my personal life and tend to make my plans around what my mood is and what my desires are. I always try to be compassionate and understanding with people. \-I work as a PC Tech and I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. My career is very important to me and I am committed to succeeding. I have my shit together career wise and financially. \-I have hang-ups. It's been a while for me since my last relationship so I come with some hang-ups. I'm not really interested in being a father or a father figure, likely ever. \-I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I need a man and a woman to feel satisfied, it doesn't mean I'm a sex maniac that will cheat at the drop of a hat. At the moment I'm only really interested in dating women, my interest in men is limited, I just wanted to put it out there that I'm bi. \-Despite how this profile might make me sound I love to laugh and have a great time with my friends. I'm just tired of being single and my lack of success has left my expectations low. Standards are high, just not expectations. I enjoy being a cut-up with people I'm familiar and comfortable with. I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I watch a lot of YouTube. I'm not above bad sex jokes. I have an interest in pursuing Cooking, Fencing, and Archery. Drama too, but I get stagefright easily. \-I love strong women (physically, mentally, strong will, decisive) and sometimes I want to lead and take care of someone, but other times I want to be led around and patted on the head. I love to snuggled and being physically close, but more than anything I am looking for emotional closeness and warmth."

I feel a little creativity and imagination might help pass the time, or at least help start an interesting enough conversation. These days can get pretty quiet, so maybe talking to someone new can alleviate the boredom. If you're not creative that's fine, I just want to know about the things that excite you, things that hold your attention and keep you guessing. Let's have a friendly chat and maybe make a new friend or two. Maybe I need a place to hideout once the zombies come knocking from spring breakers in FL. As for me, I'm easy going and try to experience most things as they come. I'm currently working on a Capture the Flag practice for Cybersecurity related stuff and it's really making me need to use my brain. It's day 7 of working from home, and I've been blasting different genres of music to keep me entertained. Today I was listening to music by mouse on the keys, [which is just super hard to describe instrumental](URL though yesterday was hip-hop and maybe some kpop. With this free time I've been able to spend more time making my pour over coffee in the morning and that's been a nice treat! So yea, let's have an easy going chat."

So if you're up for chatting (text, voice, video, penpals, etc.? Up to you!) and making a new friend, message me :) I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself, huh? ~I'm shy at first, but a completely dorky goofball once you get to know me ~I proofread, edit, and write for magazines for work, things that could put a child hyped up on espresso and puppies to sleep. Definitely something you should ask me about if you are in need of a good nap  My nickname for that may as well be The Sandman! ~I'm studying International Affairs (who knew the world was an interesting place?), Chinese, and Cybersecurity, and I graduate in a couple of months! ~I love to hike, travel, and explore abandoned places. Ever been to an abandoned prison? I have, and I'd be happy to bring you along, too! ~My taste in music is eclectic, but is definitely leaning towards indie/alt rock right now. Honestly though, I can't pick a favorite because I like it all! I also play a few instruments and am currently working on learning a few more! ~I like video games but am horrible at them, so I rarely play. But if you ever want to laugh at someone failing miserably, you'd definitely have a great time playing them with me!  ~I am so directionally challenged that my friends now know what I mean when I say ""the place on the big road by the giant tree"". So if you ever want to go on an adventure and get lost in the city, I'm your girl  ~Did you know that Queen Elizabeth worked as a mechanic in WW2 and is the only living head of state to have served in WW2? Did you want to know? Well, I'm a fount of useless trivia and I'm happy to share! Honestly just looking to meet some people who would be happy to build friendships and talk randomly throughout the day. Think that might be you?

I feel like gaming is kinda in a tough spot right now since there isn't that one game that is really good, at least for me. As a result, I don't have a defined genre I stick to. It is definitely a plus if you play video games, maybe we could play together? I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. Fair warning I have some dark humor and little filter. Of course, it's a plus if you like dark humor too. I just don't want to crack a joke that offends you. That would be no bueno. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

Pics are available upon request. I suppose I'm just taking a new approach and I'm just tired of fake pleasantries. I want to make a real connection with someone and share my vulnerable self. I would strongly prefer that you be local so we can see one another in person. \-I'm 5'11"" and 251 lbs and I come with a beard. I'm dieting for my health and to feel more attractive. I hit the gym for strength training and run in my neighborhood, but I sometimes have trouble keeping that going consistently. \-I am Agnostic and liberal in my politics. I tend to approach issues with logic and reason. I always try to be compassionate and understanding with people. \-I work as a PC Tech and I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. My career is very important to me and I am committed to succeeding. I have my shit together career wise and financially. \-I have hang-ups. It's been a while for me since my last relationship so I come with some hang-ups. I'm not really interested in being a father or a father figure, likely ever. \-I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I need a man and a woman to feel satisfied, it doesn't mean I'm a sex maniac that will cheat at the drop of a hat. At the moment I'm only really interested in dating women, my interest in men is limited, I just wanted to put it out there that I'm bi. \-Despite how this profile might make me sound I love to laugh and have a great time with my friends. I'm just tired of being single and my lack of success has left my expectations low. Standards are high, just not expectations. I enjoy being a cut-up with people I'm familiar and comfortable with. I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I watch a lot of YouTube. I'm not above bad sex jokes. I have an interest in pursuing Cooking, Fencing, and Archery. Drama too, but I get stagefright easily. \-I love strong women (physically, mentally, strong will, decisive) and sometimes I want to lead and take care of someone, but other times I want to be led around and patted on the head. I love short hair! Tomboys are definitely welcome! \-Please be local. It matters to me to have someone I can date and spend time with and maybe one day hold and snuggle with."

Every few months, I find myself making another one of these posts, whether here or somewhere else. Unfortunately, the last post got a lot of replies, but almost none from women (what is it with married 40 year old men hitting on a 21 year old lesbian?), and this girl needs some estrogen in her life! So if you're up for chatting (text, voice, video, penpals, etc.? Up to you!), message me :) I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself, huh? \~I'm shy at first, but a completely dorky goofball once you get to know me \~I proofread/edit books and magazines for work, things that could put a child hyped up on espresso and puppies to sleep. Definitely something you should ask me about if you are in need of a good nap  My nickname for that may as well be The Sandman! \~I'm studying International Affairs (who knew the world was an interesting place?), Chinese, and Cybersecurity, and I graduate in May! \~I love to hike, travel, and explore abandoned places. Ever been to an abandoned prison? I have, and I'd be happy to bring you along, too! \~My taste in music is eclectic, but is definitely leaning towards indie rock right now. Honestly though, I can't pick a favorite because I like it all! I also play a few instruments and recently started playing gigs at some places around me. \~I like video games but am horrible at them, so I rarely play. But if you ever want to laugh at someone failing miserably, you'd definitely have a great time playing them with me!  \~I am so directionally challenged that my friends now know what I mean when I say ""the place on the big road by the giant tree"". So if you ever want to go on an adventure and get lost in the city, I'm your girl  \~Did you know that Queen Elizabeth worked as a mechanic in WW2 and is the only living head of state to have served in WW2? Did you want to know? Well, I'm a fount of useless trivia and I'm happy to share! Honestly just looking to meet some people who would be happy to talk randomly throughout the day. Think that might be you? Message me with the most interesting thing you've done lately ;)"

Hi, I'm Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy from southern Michigan that's looking for a long-term, serious relationship. This post isn't going to be short, but if you stick it through to the end, maybe it'll end up being worth it. To start, I'm only looking for people around my age with, say, a soft cap of 20 years old. Not to say if you're a bit older don't message if you think we'd click, but the closer to my age, the better. Second, location doesn't *entirely* matter, long distance is fine, but of course the closer to Michigan, the better. Ideally the relationship wouldn't be long distance forever. The last thing would be time. Long distance is hard, but what makes it harder is if our schedules don't match up enough for us to be able to talk and do things together on a regular basis. I'm EST (GMT -5), work weekend nights (usually any time between 4 pm and 10:30 pm), and have college classes during the week. The college classes are easier to work around, as they are usually only 2 hours more or less, but they do exist so I thought I'd mention them. Alright, now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about some of my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and where a majority of my friends come from. If you aren't really sure what this is, that's fine (Dungeons and Dragons may ring a bell, but it's still okay if not). I don't have the space to explain it all here, but if you're interested in learning how to play or already do play, I'd be happy to do so. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. I enjoy Halo, Fallout, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, Titanfall, and a few more games. I've also recently started playing a bit of minecraft again after a four year hiatus with the game dying down. Whether we play together, watch each other play (I very much enjoy watching my significant other play games), or whatever else, it's something we can do together or talk about. **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's all my major interests/hobbies. If you share some or all of them, awesome. If you don't share any, then maybe we aren't the best fit. It's not a requirement to like all or even any of them, but it's certainly an upside if you do. Next up, where am I in life right now? Well I'll tell you! I graduated high school this year and am currently a college student at Baker college here in Michigan. My major is for Cybersecurity, and though it isn't particularly a passion of mine, I'm at least interested in it and know it'll be easy to get a job in the field. I work part time and have been working at the same place for the last year and a half. It's a shitty retail job, but it could be worse I guess. I've been in two previous relationships, both of which stemmed from reddit and both of which never ended up meeting in person due to distance. Hopefully that can be different this time. Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been working on losing weight since the start of summer and have been succeeding, and I'll hopefully be able to keep going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd say below average due to the acne. I hate saying it, but physical attraction does matter to me. I'll gladly send a photo of myself as soon as you ask and would hope you'd return the favor. I'd also rather we do it sooner rather than later. Alright, one more (albeit large) section before the conclusion of this post. Here's where I'm going to talk about what I enjoy in a relationship/about a partner. This is the most important part of this post, so if you don't share any of these, we mostly likely won't fit well. To begin, I really enjoy silly romantic coupley stuff. I just do. I even took a love languages test and have the scores still, and will tell you them if you want to know. Cutesy voices, pet names, all that jazz. It makes me happy. Second, I will want to spend a ton of time with you if we click. Hours every day preferably. I'll also never not want to get a message from you, so double text, triple text, quadruple text, whatever. If I like you, I'll love all of it. We don't have to be doing something necessarily together, just being there on the phone with each other or whatever while we do our own things is comforting. Third, I will always always always give you compliments, care, support, and make sure you know you're loved. I will also want all of that back. If we're gonna be each others' person, then my person deserves to know that she's beautiful, supported, cared for, and loved every day. It might get repetitive, but I'm going to keep saying it and showing it, and hope you'd do the same for me. Words of affirmation are amazing, and I love both giving and receiving them. Fourth (only one more section after this one, I promise), I am very much an advocate for being able to communicate with each other. If something's up, you have me to talk to, no matter the subject. I, like before, hope that I have the support to be able to communicate with you about anything I may need to as well. A couple that can't communicate is bound to fail, so this is a must. If you don't know if you're good at communicating or not, I'll gladly do my best to try and teach you how. All I need is for you to be with me, not against me on it. Lastly, I do not smoke, drink, do drugs, party, or do anything of the sort. I'm rather introverted overall. I won't draw any static lines saying I'll never date someone that does X, but keep these in mind when deciding if you want to message or not. Alright, there you go. You've reached the end of this long-ass post. Maybe you're interested, maybe you're not. Whether you decide to message me or not, I hope you have a good day and do find what you're looking for!"

It's made finding real life interaction hard at times, combined with the fact I live in a somewhat rural area which makes it hard to go out and party in the city. I'm a cybersecurity major but my interests mostly lie in the humanities: classic literature, history, theology, art, and ancient languages. I also love cooking (especially french food) and classic movies. Most of the time I spend not studying I'm reading, swimming or going outdoors. I'm pretty easy going but can be a bit serious and traditional at times.

It's going to be long so if you have the attention span hang in there. I've spent days debating on posting something but I'm going to give it a shot. I'm going through a recent break up and could use companionship. Part of this break up involves moving from Charlotte back to Denver. He is already dating someone else and I need the distraction. Side note: my dad would kill me if he knew I was posting this. Ok so that is my current situation if you've made it this far congratulations. About me I am a single mother of 3 teenager, hispanic short and slightly BBW though working on that. I love my kids and attend all their activities. I work from home and have for the last 5 years but am working toward a cybersecurity degree. I LOVE the Broncos and actually follow football. I love to read and have a problem when it comes to buying books as my to be read pile is growing exponentially. I enjoy talking politics and current news events. I am a HUGE Harry Potter nerd. I love true crime and fantasy. My ex introduced me to board games such Pandemic, Terraforming Mars, and other games. So I do love board gaming now and it is recent to my interests. Painting d&amp;d miniatures and playing some video games. Witcher is my favorite gaming series I have played so far I have read the books and can't wait for the show. Speaking of shows I love to watch new things, I enjoy movies as well. Some of my favorite shows Gilmore Girls, Breaking Bad, The Office and Game of Thrones. Some of my favorite movies Godfather, The Departed, Super Troopers, The Devil Wears Prada. I love music anything from classical to metal. Would love to go on a date to the symphony one day. I love/want to travel and enjoy visiting museums and getting lost on spontaneous road trips. If your into MBTI I'm an INFP. Get me alone and have fun getting me to stop talking. What I looking for...moving back to Denver does put me closer to my family and friends but none of them fully understand my new found interests or even some of my old ones. I would like someone who can talk to me and keep up with me. Who understands I have kids and that if there is anything to grow it will have to be slowly. Looking for someone in Denver to grab drinks with, play board games with, maybe go see a movie or just hang out talking about anything that interests us. No out of state, married, in a relationship, not looking for dick pics either. If you want to talk shit about my baggage or otherwise move along. I think I'm a wonderful person and one day someone will realize I'm worth more than I've gotten in past relationships. I'm a complicated person with lots of interests as you can see. I just want to have deep conversations and not have to be the only one maintaining the relationship. I have a kik if you want to chat pm me."

Hi there, I'm Gary. Be forewarned that this post is going to be rather long, as most of my posts have been, but if you read it and find what you're looking for, it's probably worth the five minutes or so spent reading. Let's start with the basics. As you already know (assuming you didn't skip the first paragraph), my name is Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a retail job, and goes to college for Cybersecurity. I'm looking for a serious, long-term relationship with an amazing woman (and yes, you are amazing, so that doesn't mean it's time for you to check out). Other than general compatibility with interests, hobbies, and relationship goals, there's only a few ""requirements"" per se. **Age**: I'm looking for someone around my age. I'd put a soft cap at 20 years old, but if you think we'd really click, but you're a bit older, then still send me a message and we'll see where it leads! **Location**: Long distance is fine as long we can eventually meet up. Obviously the closer the better (and less expensive to visit each other). I'll also add here that I work nights and many of my classes are at night, so think about how that works with your schedule (EST (GMT -5) time with work being around 4 PM to 10:30 PM on the weekends and class being around 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the weekdays) **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty introverted and, for lack of a better term, a goody two shoes. I don't smoke, vape, drink, do drugs, go to parties, or do anything of the sort. I'm not saying I'd never want to date someone that is into any of that, but keep this in mind when deciding if you want to message me. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Congratulations! You're about 1/3 done with this post. Yes, about 1/3 done. You've put in the work to read this far, so I know you can make it to the end. Next up are my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and also where a majority of my friends come from. If you don't really know what a tabletop roleplaying game is, that's okay. The name dungeons and dragons may ring a bell, but if not, that's also okay. If you want to learn more about them or already do play them, that's certainly a talking point we can have in the future! **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly enjoy specific titles like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Titanfall, the Witcher, and a few others. I've also recently started playing minecraft again after a few years due to the recent resurgence in popularity. Whether you play (and if you do, I do enjoy just watching my significant other play while we talk) similar games or different games, this can be something we do together :) **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's another 1/3 down. That means you're a grand total of 2/3 done with this post. I saved the most important parts for last. Up next are my physical traits and relationship expectations. After that it's just a short conclusion, then you're done reading this essay of a post. Physical Traits: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been losing weight since the start of summer and am still going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd overall say below average because of the acne. I will gladly send a picture as soon as you ask and hope you'd return the favor. For me, physical attraction is important. It's certainly nowhere near the most important, but it still is important. I'd also hope we can exchange pictures sooner rather than later. Next up is the most important section of this post, which is why I saved it for last. Here's where I'll talk about the expectations of a relationship I have. Before I start, I will mention I've only ever been in two relationships, both of which stemmed from here and we never ended up meeting in real life either time. Overall I'd say I'm pretty inexperienced in dating, and that brings me to my first point. **Grow Together**: This is probably the weirdest part of this section, but it's also pretty important to me. This is also the main reason I want to meet someone around my age. I want to be in the same part of life my significant other is. Whether it's going through college, just starting out being an adult, and also experiencing a relationship like this for the first time. I want someone in the same spot in life that I'm in that's had similar experiences (and lack of experiences) that we can bond over. **Silly Couple Stuff**: I absolutely love that gooey, silly, romantic couple stuff. Pet names, cutesy voices, and overall just being in a blissful state of love where the sun is shining and the two of us are oblivious to the world's problems because we know we have each other. I even filled out one of those love languages tests and will gladly share the results if you ask :) **Care and Support**: I will always *always* show my significant other that she is cared for and supported in every possible way, and I want someone that will do the same for me. Being able to have an emotional crutch for all the bad in life is important, and because of that, this part is very important to me. This also ties in to words of affirmation to one another. I will always give compliments, words of encouragement, and let my significant other know that she is loved, cared for, and supported. Simply saying ""I love you"" isn't the end of it. I will go above and beyond to make sure she knows how much I love her. **Quality Time**: If we really click, I'm going to want to spend all of my time with you. Hours every day would be preferable, but sometimes life gets in the way of course. Whether it be messaging, calling, or video chatting, I will want to spend time with you. I will never not want to hear from you, meaning you can double message, triple message, quadruple message, whatever! We don't necessarily have to be doing something together either. Just having each other to talk to while we do our own things is comforting. I'll also add here that I love love love falling asleep together. It's one of my favorite things to do :) Alright, you did it. Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this ridiculously long post. I hope I've convinced you to message me and see where things go, but if not, then that's okay. I hope that you find what you're looking for. To everyone that's taken their time to read this post, thank you, and have an amazing day. P.S. If you are thinking about messaging me, just open with your name, age, location, and why you decided to message me :) Hopefully, we'll hit it off from there, but if not, that's okay. I promise I won't ghost if I don't think we're going to fit well and hope you'll do the same! &lt;3"

Hi there, I'm Gary. Be forewarned that this post is going to be rather long, as most of my posts here have been, but if you read it and find what you're looking for, it's probably worth the five minutes or so spent reading. Let's start with the basics. As you already know (assuming you didn't skip the first paragraph), my name is Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a retail job, and goes to college for Cybersecurity. I'm looking for a serious, long-term relationship with an amazing woman (and yes, you are amazing, so that doesn't mean it's time for you to check out).

I'll also add here that I work nights and many of my classes are at night, so think about how that works with your schedule (EST (GMT -5) time with work being around 4 PM to 10:30 PM on the weekends and class being around 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the weekdays) **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty introverted and, for lack of a better term, a goody two shoes.

567,cybersecurity,r4r,18 [M4F] Michigan / Online. Anyone looking for something serious and long lasting?,1,cp6vz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/cp6vz1/18_m4f_michigan_online_anyone_looking_for/,2019-08-12 13:35:34,"Hi there, I'm Gary. From the title, you can see what this post is about, but I've got a lot more to say, so strap in. Hopefully it ends up being worth it for you. I'm looking for a serious long term relationship with someone around my age. I'm not looking for something short and fun, but instead a close personal connection filled with love and care for one another. It can be long distance, as long as the end goal is to finally be together once we decide that we're ready. Now, here's a little about me. If you share any of these interests, then we have something to talk about. If you don't share any at all, maybe I'm not the guy for you. **Music**: My interest in music is kind of unconventional, but I consider it a large part of my personality. I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation, loved singing (and hope I can find a way to keep singing), and loved the environment of the choir family even more. It shaped me as a person and was the only really good thing about high school for me. It introduced me to musicals, which is where most of my music interest lies. Some musicals I've seen and enjoyed (definitely legally and certainly not bootlegged) were Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and Book of Mormon. I don't really listen to any other kind of music because I'm a bit weird I guess. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: You may have not heard of these before, but Dungeons and Dragons might ring a bell. Whether you know what they are or not, these are my main hobby. I play with friends multiple times a week and it's where most of my friends come from. If you play, have played, or want to learn to play, that's a big positive, but that's not to say that not really being interested is a negative. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but I enjoy many sci-fi, fantasy rpg, and other game genres. Some of my favorite specific games are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the the Witcher. I'm also going to college for Cybersecurity. It isn't exactly a huge interest, more so a career I wouldn't mind going into that I know will be easy to get a good job in and pays a decent bit of money. If money were no object, my dream job would be a writer for some of those video game genres that interest me. I'm also currently working as a retail worker, and plan to throughout college until something better comes along. I almost always work nights, and with that comes me being a bit of a night owl. I'm usually up until at least 2 am EST and sleep until around noon EST. Physically, I have the following features: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer and am still dropping. Appearance: I'd say I'm about average before you take into account acne, so below average. Hopefully I can get it cleared up sometime soon. I'll send a picture if you ask, though will ask for one in return. Physical attraction is important, and I don't want us to get a week in before seeing each other and then not be attracted to one another. If we click, which I hope we do, I will love being able to care for and about you, and will especially love when and if that care is reciprocated. I want to hear about your day, what's happening in your life, and give you the support you need. We all have bad days, but if we're there for each other, maybe they don't have to be so bad. I'm going to be honest, if I like you, I won't want to take things slow. I want us to get to the point in the relationship where we can both love, care about, and support each other as soon as possible, because that's the best feeling in the world. I usually know if I like someone within a couple hours of talking to them. If you're not the same way, that's perfectly okay, we can take our time. If you do feel the same way, then that's wonderful. Things I enjoy and will want to do if we end up in a committed relationship: **Be Present**: Yes, as simple as that, be present. Okay, maybe not as simple as that. I will want to talk to you for hours every day. Whether it be messaging, voice chat, or video chat, being there with you is what I'll want. I also very very very much enjoy falling asleep on the phone together. Sometimes life gets in the way, but ideally we'll be able to spend time together despite it. **Corny Relationship Talk**: I don't care what other people say or think. I'm gonna want to give you a cute nickname, constantly tell you how much I love you, and just be silly with you. **Be Involved**: I'm going to want to know what's happening in your life. Know how you're doing. If you're feeling down, I'll want to bring you up or at least comfort you. I'll want us to both be happy, because what else is a relationship for, right? All right, I'm almost done, I swear. Just want to mention a few things about a few things that are deal breakers. **Drugs, alcohol, and tobacco**: First off, if you do any illegal drugs, this is not going to work. Marijuana is borderline. I'm not against it being legalized or anything, I'm just not interested. If you smoke, the same goes. I can't be with a smoker. I'm a bit more lenient on alcohol, but if you drink a lot, whether you're of age or not, this probably won't work. **Partying**: I'm an introvert. I don't go out to parties or other social functions. If you do, it isn't exactly a deal breaker, but it might be hard for us to be together because I do not enjoy things like that. Overall I'm pretty traditional and, for lack of a better term, a goody-two-shoes. I thank you for your time spent reading this. If I'm lucky, I'll find someone I can hold onto. Whether you want to message me or not, have a nice day, and I hope you find what you are looking for. P.S. If we end up not liking each other for any reason, please don't ghost. I can promise you I won't ghost you, but getting ghosted feels terrible, and I'd rather whichever one of us isn't liking the other say it directly."
568,cybersecurity,r4r,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere: Are you lonely and looking for something serious?,2,cpjkms,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/cpjkms/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_are_you_lonely_and/,2019-08-13 08:16:43,"Because if you are, maybe we have something to talk about. Hi, I'm Gary. I don't have any laser shows or excitement to share, but I do have a lot of love to give. Truth be told, I'm recently out of what was a good relationship, and I want what I had back. I want someone to care about, love, and support, and someone that will care about, love, and support me. Feeling completely and utterly alone, even when you have friends, is a terrible feeling, so maybe we can fix that for each other. I'm an 18 year old guy that is starting his first semester of college here in a couple weeks. I'm headed into Cybersecurity and hoping to get a job in the field as soon as possible. As of now (and most likely until I finish college), I'm working as a retail worker, which isn't exactly the most exciting of jobs. I want a serious, long term, monagamous relationship with someone that I will want to spend countless hours talking to every day and want to not only share my life with, but have her share her life with me. Long distance is fine as long as we plan on eventually being together, though being close enough to visit regularly until then would be ideal. Here are a few of my interests. If we share any, I'd love to talk about them. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: These are getting more popular as time goes on, which I think is very cool. If you don't know what they are, it'll take too much time and space to explain here, but the name Dungeons and Dragons may sound familiar for what it's worth. This is my primary hobby. It's where a majority of my friends come from, It's where I spend a lot of my free time (besides on youtube), and is one of my favorite things. If you do play or want to learn to play, then we have something to talk about. If not, don't worry, there's more to have in common coming. **Music**: My taste in music is odd, but my background in music might explain it a bit. I was in choir from 6th grade all the way until graduation and loved every second of it. It was my home in high school, which didn't offer me much happiness in and of itself. Being connected with people through choir was what made both middle and high school hospitable for me, so I attribute a large part of my personality to that. It also introduced me to musicals, which is where most of my music interest lies. Musicals I've enjoyed are Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Book of Mormon, and Be More Chill, and those musicals' tracks are what a majority of the music I listen to is. **Video Games**: I've fallen off playing them in recent times, but I still enjoy playing them occasionally. Some games I enjoy are Halo, Titanfall, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One, so if you enjoy any of these games (or any other games), that's something fun we can do together. If you enjoy a particular game, I'd love to just sit and watch you play. **Writing and History**: These are more minor interests, but writing can be a lot of fun at times. I mainly do it for my tabletop rpg games, but I'd like to expand out into other forms as well. As for history, I just very much enjoy medieval history, American revolution history, and sometimes ancient Roman history. **YouTube**: Ah yes, youtube. Where I spend a majority of my time while I'm alone. There isn't much to say about this other than mentioning Rooster Teeth. If you know who they are, then that's absolutely wonderful and I'd love to just relax and watch some of their content with you. There's plenty more I watch, so maybe we'll have someone in common. That's about all my hobbies. There's a couple smaller things here and there, but you'll learn about those over time if you message me and we grow close. Now onto my physical features then what I enjoy in a relationship. Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer, which has been great. Appearance: I do have acne, so there's that to consider. Before the acne, I'd say about average, so afterwards, below average. I will absolutely send a picture of myself if you ask, and hope you would return the favor. Physical appearance is important, and I'd always prefer to get it out of the way sooner rather than later. I previously mentioned I just got out of a good relationship, which was also my first relationship (and was long distance and from reddit as well), so what I'm about to say is only governed by that one relationship, as well as just my general thoughts. If I like you, which I usually know after the first couple hours of talking to someone, then this is what I'll want: **Talking for Hours**: I will want to talk to you for hours on end every day. Whether it be messaging, voice chat, or video chat, I will want to be spending a large majority of my time with you if possible. Of course life can get in the way, but we'd hopefully be able to enjoy each other's company a lot. **Love and Care**: The best part of a relationship has to be being loved and cared for. Knowing that this one other person really does truly care about you and wants to be with you. Expressing these emotions is a must. I personally prefer to do it through constant reminders of how much I love and care about you, but that's just me. **Communication**: Being able to communicate what we want and are feeling well is important. I promise to not hold anything back if you promise not to hold anything back, okay? **Plans for the Future**: This is the part where I might scare some of you off. I've said I wanted a serious long term relationship. That means that I will want to eventually talk about our plans for the future. Moving in together, getting married, out stances on children, all of that. Obviously it doesn't have to be for awhile, but I am looking for my future wife with this post. Alright, as we're getting to the end of this post, I first off want to thank anyone that's made it this far. I so hope I get some messages, but regardless if that message is from you, I do hope you find what you're looking for. The last thing I want to talk about is my lifestyle. I'm, for lack of a better term, a goody-two-shoes. I don't do drugs, smoke, or drink alcohol. I'm introverted and don't go out to parties and other social events, I'm not religious (though this one is okay as long as you don't try to force your religion on me; I will absolutely respect your religion), and I'm more liberal than conservative. I won't draw a static line saying what I am and am not okay with, but just take this information and question if you think we'd fit well together. If you still think we would, shoot me a message. I'd love to hear from you. Thank you, and have a nice a day."

I'm Gary, an 18 year old guy currently working a retail job at Dollar General and headed to college in a mere four days for Cybersecurity. Putting it all out there, I'm looking for a long term, serious relationship with a girl around my age that I can hopefully make happy and who will hopefully make me happy. Long distance is perfectly okay, as long as there's a plan to eventually meet up assuming everything goes well between us. Warning: long post ahead (but hopefully it's worth it!) Here are a few of my interests and hobbies. If you share any, I'd love to talk about it! **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is where most of my social life is spent. If you don't know what these are, maybe the name Dungeons and Dragons rings a bell, but if not, that's okay too! I met a majority of my friends through TTRPGS and still regularly play with those friends. If you play or are interested in learning, that's a big positive, but if not, don't worry! There's plenty more for us to have in common! **Music**: I'm pretty weird about the music I listen to. It's all primarily music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and the Book of Mormon, as well as a bit of choir music and mid-20th century music. I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved every second of it, which may explain my music tastes a bit as it's where I was introduced to musicals and, of course, choir music. **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but I grew up playing video games and still do on occasion nowadays. I enjoy Roleplaying Games like the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout, as well as the Halo series and a good amount of other random games here and there. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. Whether we play games together or one of us watches the other play, this is certainly something we could have fun doing together! **YouTube**: When I'm not with my friends, working, or (when school starts) studying or at school, I'm probably on youtube. I watch dozens of amazing channels ranging from gaming, historical, live action, and more. My favorite group is probably Rooster Teeth, so if you enjoy them too, that's certainly something we can do together. There's plenty more I watch though, so I'm sure we can find a channel in common! If you share any of those interests, I'd love to hear from you! Having a significant other that shares your interests and hobbies is important, especially in a long distance relationship. Next, I'll move on to my physical traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of the summer, and am continuing to lose more! Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I'm say about about average before you take into account my acne, so below average, at least until I can get it cleared up. I'm more than willing to send a picture as soon as you ask, and hope you'd be willing to do the same. I find physical attraction important in a relationship, so I'd prefer to get it out of the way sooner rather than later. Next, I want to talk a bit about my lifestyle and how I'd want a partner with a similar lifestyle as myself. I am introverted, don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't go out to parties (or really any social event), and am not religious. I won't draw any static lines saying I won't date someone that does X, but keep these in mind when deciding if you want to message me or not. I will note that I physically can't be with a smoker because I have asthma. If it's a habit you're looking to break, I'm more than willing to help and support you along that path, but if you have no plans on at least trying to stop, it just won't work between us. One last section, this time about what I enjoy and expect in a relationship. It's important my partner share similar ideals on this front, in fact it's probably the most important part of this entire post: **Affectionate**: I always like to show affection in obvious ways. Compliments, straight up saying how much I care about you, using cutesy couple talk, asking for cuddles (even if we're hundreds or thousands of miles away), etc. I want a partner that will be affectionate to me in this way as well. **There For Each Other**: I absolutely love being able to be there for my partner. Listening to them when they need to vent, offering a (usually metaphorical due to distance) shoulder to cry on, and keeping them company whenever they need it. It makes me happy to know I'm helping my significant other in this way, and hope you would do the same for me if I ever needed it. I'll also add here that I reeaaallly enjoy falling asleep on the phone with my significant other. It really helps me have a nice, restful sleep, and I love when she's the last thing I hear at night. **Lots of Talking!**: If we really click, I'm going to want to talk to you nonstop. Messaging, voice calls, and once we get comfortable enough, video calls, any kind of talking. I also will never not want to hear from you. I don't care if you wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. I'll want you to keep calling me until I wake up. Double message me, triple message me, quadruple message me, whatever. I will always want to be talking to you whenever I possibly can. Well that about wraps up the post. I do hope I get at least one message, because that's all you really need, right?. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read all this. Overall, I just want to find my person, and if you feel the same way, shoot me a message. Whether you decide to message me or not, have a great day, and I hope you find what you're looking for. &lt;3"
573,cybersecurity,r4r,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere: Third Time's a Charm...Right? Looking for a Serious and Long Term Relationship.,1,cv35qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/cv35qc/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_third_times_a_charmright/,2019-08-25 12:53:42,"Hey there, it's me, Gary. I say third time's a charm, but I only really mean third time this week. The last two posts didn't get any replies, so I'm gonna change up my strategy a bit here. Usually, I'd post a big long page talking about all my interests, wants, and goals for a relationship, but this time I'm just going to give a bit of a shorter, bite-sized post, and if you want to know more, you'll just have to message me to find out :) Starting with **interests**, I spend most of my time with friends playing tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, which is probably my favorite hobby. In descending order of largest to smallest hobby, youtube is oddly enough the second on my list. It's where I spend most of my time when I'm not with friends, working, at school, etc. Next up is video games. I don't play them all that often anymore, but used to play a lot. I still really enjoy Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. Lastly (at least of those prominent enough to make the list) are my music tastes, which are pretty odd. I mainly only listen to music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, Hamilton, and the Book of Mormon. (I'll also just kind of slide it in here that I'm headed to college for Cybersecurity in a mere three days and currently working as a retail worker.) **Physically**, I'm 5""11, blue eyes, short and brown hair, a bit overweight (though not huge, and am currently losing weight), and probably below average appearance wise, mainly because of my acne (at least I hope so). I'll send a picture as soon as you ask, and hope you'll return the gesture. As the title states, I'm looking for a serious, long term **relationship** with someone around my age. Said relationship can be long distance as long as we can plan to eventually meet up. What I find important in a relationship is being affectionate with one another, being able to support one another, and being able to spend a lot of time together. If you agree with all those, then I think we'd make a great fit. Last bit of this ""short"" post (I swear it's still only like a third of the length of my usual ones) is that I'm a pretty **introverted and traditional** guy. I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, go to parties, etc. That's not to say it wouldn't work if you're more extroverted or less traditional, but just keep that information in mind And that's the end! Thank you for taking your time to read to this whether you decide to message me or not. If so, that's awesome, if not, that's okay too. I hope you find what you're looking for."

A few months back I saw a ""Looking for my Future Husband"", which caught my eye, so maybe this will catch yours? Well hi, I'm Gary. Fourth post this week and I'm gonna continue changing things up a bit, give some new information, and hopefully it gets me at least one reply! What I'm looking for is a serious, long term, monogamous relationship that will hopefully lead to a life filled with love and happiness. As of now, I'm very lonely, and want to find my person so we can share each other's lives with one another. Long distance is perfectly fine as long as we can make a plan to eventually meet once we're both ready. The type of girl I'm looking for is one that is around my age and thinks the same things are important in relationships that I do. I'm very affectionate, and like to show that affection through compliments, cutesy talk, support, and just generally talking about how much I care about and love you. This is the most important part of a relationship in my opinion. I also want to be able to emotionally support and connect through listening to each other, being able to vent to each other, and just being there for each other when we need it. The last main thing about what I want in a relationship is being able (and wanting to) spend lots of time together. Whether it's long distance or not, I'm going to want to talk for hours every day, just getting to know you better and enjoying each other's company. I also reeaaallly enjoy falling asleep on the phone together (hell, we could do it the tonight if you message me now!). I always love getting messages from someone I'm talking in this way, so you don't have to shy away from messaging me tons if you actually like me. Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost weight since the start of summer and am still losing it! Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I have acne, which I'd say puts me below average, but hopefully I can get it cleared up soon, which (at least I like to believe so) would bring me up to average. I am more than willing to send a picture of myself if you ask, and I hope you would return the gesture. I find physical attraction important, so I'd prefer for us to see each other sooner rather than later. A few of my interests are as follows: - **Tabletop Roleplaying Games** (like Dungeons and Dragons) - **Video Games** (Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, Fallout, etc; play on PC and Xbox One) - **YouTube** (gaming, historical, live action, etc; favorite group is Rooster Teeth) - **Musicals** (really the only kind of music I listen to besides a few other specifics because I'm a weirdo) - **TV Shows** (Avatar the Last Airbender, How I Met Your Mother, Breaking Bad are a few of my favorites) - **Cybersecurity** (not so much a hobby or interest, but what I'm headed to college for) - **Singing** (I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation. I've been told I'm good, but I hate my own voice) Lastly, I'll note that I'm a pretty introverted guy that doesn't really do anything some might consider ""bad"" like drinking, smoking, drugs, etc. I don't go to parties or other big social events. That's not to say extroverts that do any of that stuff won't meld well with me, it's just something to keep in mind. Thank you for reading this post. I very much hope I at least get one response this time, but if not, I guess I'll try again later. Whether you decide to message me or not, have a nice a day, and I hope you find what you're looking for!"

Hello everyone! I'm on here looking for a nice girl to talk to and have a good time with, and then who knows maybe it could turn into something else. I don't really want to rush things though. I've tried the whole Tinder thing and all that but I realized it's damn hard finding a girl I'm interested in on there so I figure I'd try my luck here since this is where the more introverted people hang out. ABOUT ME: First things first, I know people care about physical stuff. I'm 6'1"", have long black hair and brown eyes, and I have a pretty fair complexion. You can see me [here](URL I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I feel like gaming is kinda in a tough spot right now since there isn't that one game that is really good, at least for me. As a result, I don't have a defined genre I stick to. It is definitely a plus if you play video games, maybe we could play together? I'm in college right now trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. Fair warning I have some really dark humor, so I have little filter. Of course, it's a plus if you like dark humor too. I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

My name's Gary, and I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan and is currently going to college for Cybersecurity and working a retail job. I'm looking for a serious, Long-term, and monogamous relationship with a girl around my age that shares at least one interest with me. Long distance is perfectly fine (as long as we can eventually plan to meet up), though I'll note that I'm a bit of a night owl, so think of that plus my EST time zone if you are pretty far away :) What are these interests I'd like if we shared you ask? Well, here's my answer: **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: Yeah I'm a bit of a geek. This is what my social life consists of and is where I've met most of my friends. If you enjoy the hobby, I'd love to play with you. If you're interested in trying it out, I'd love to teach you! **Video Games**: Not exactly a huge part of my life anymore, but I still enjoy them occasionally. A few of my favorites are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. There's others, but those are definitely where most of my gaming interests lie. I mainly play on PC, but have an Xbox One as well. **Music**: Here's where I mention I'm pretty weird. My music tastes are...unconventional to say the least. I mainly only listen to music from musicals ( like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, Book of Mormon), some choral music (I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved every second of it), and the occasional tune from the 80s. **YouTube**: I spend faaaar too much time on youtube. It's basically what I'm doing when I'm not with friends, at work, or at school. I watch a few different genres, namely gaming, historical, and some live action. My favorite group is Rooster Teeth, so if you know who they are, that's awesome! Those are all of my main hobbies and interests, but you might find out more if we get to talking! Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer and am still dropping. I even have a progress pic if you want to see :) Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I'd have to say below average due to my acne. Not accounting for acne, I'd say relatively average. Hopefully I can get it cleared up soon! I'm more than willing to send a picture, and I hope you'll do the same. I find physical attraction is important, so I don't want us building a connection before seeing each other. Alright, now we get down into the nitty-gritty (I don't think I've ever used that expression in my life, so don't expect word usage like that if we start talking). I am looking for a woman I can have a loving, caring, and supportive relationship with. It's important to me that she enjoys receiving and giving affection, because I will constantly compliment her, tell her how much I love her, and constantly want snuggles (even if we're hundreds of miles away). It's just the kind of person I am. I'll also want to talk to you nonstop if I can. Messages, calling, video chatting, all of it. If we click, I'll want to be with you whenever possible. On the flip side, I will never not want to hear from you. Double message, triple message, whatever. I don't care if we're not doing anything related, I'll still want to call just to keep each other company. I'd also really enjoy calling for the first time sooner rather than later, as I can usually decide if I click with someone after a few hours of calling in a way I can't over messages. Last part before the end, I promise. Personality wise, I'm introverted and kind of a goody-two-shoes. I never skipped school, don't drink alcohol, smoke, do drugs, etc. My personality type is INTJ if you're into that kind of thing. I won't draw any static lines, just keep this all in mind when deciding whether you want to message me or not. Thank you to all of you that read through this. I very much hope I get at least one message because that's you really need, right? Whether you decide to message or not, have a nice day, and I hope you find what you're looking for."
578,cybersecurity,r4r,21[F4R] Anywhere. I want to bare my soul to you,0,cz54lq,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/cz54lq/21f4r_anywhere_i_want_to_bare_my_soul_to_you/,2019-09-03 23:49:53,"First, for context, check this out [URL As someone who has always looked down upon vulnerability, I want to really know if it makes a significant difference to ""living"". I don't know when I started building walls around me. I probably even have a moat around them (No, I have never been hurt by anyone. I have never given anyone the chance). I have a pretty loving family and friends. But no one knows the whole truth about me. 95% yes, but nowhere near complete. Not all of me. There are obviously things I am not proud of doing but I would do them again given the same circumstances. I do not like regrets and maybe that feeds into me being closed off. I am pretty extroverted and excel in the art of making friends. People seem to think that they really know me because of that. And, over the years, keeping some chunks of me to myself has become extremely easy (maybe keeping a part of you to yourself is a good thing. I am not disputing that). The point is I only gave thought to the issue of vulnerability after listening to that video and I want to see if it is all it seems cut out to be. I am an ENTP. A Leo (I don't believe in Astrology but I find that most of the personality traits ring true for me). I am both book smart (the whole honor roll student gig, topped the graduating class majoring in Comp Sci) and street smart (result of the environment in which I grew up). I am physically and mentally fit. Since, this isn't about finding common ground but being completely vulnerable to each other, we can talk about our interests later on. What exactly am I looking for? I want someone who can commit six months to knowing a stranger. When I say commit, I mean sticking it out, whichever way the road leads. I want someone who is willing to lay their feelings/existence bare. If you judge me on something I say, I want to know about it (and you should also be able to take judgement) \[Include a color in the subject\]If you feel my late responses hurt you, you tell me. I want you to hide nothing from me. I will do the same of course. All of this is assuming that you can hold conversations. Obviously there are some deal breakers : No racists, homophobes, xenophobes, anti-vaxxers, anti-abortionists, smokers, or far right people. Also, I would like you to be in a good place mentally. This is about baring your soul and I do not want to unintentionally hurt you by triggering something. About this turning into something romantic : That is NOT the goal. I would want to hear from women too. However, if it comes to that, it should be worth exploring. I am single and straight. Physically 5'4'' and athletic. If you are hoping that this might turn into something romantic, then of course physical attraction is important. Since I intend this entire exchange to be anonymous (whaaaat? I will explain), I will give you a general idea of my ""type"", having dated around a bit - be fit (health should be important to you) and taller than me in heels (so over 5'8'') About anonymity: I intend to get into a political career in the near future. Also, I have a very unique full name. One google search and you can find more mentions of me than I would like you to. But then, what is the point of this exercise? This is the internet. Having taught a course in cybersecurity, I have good reason to be wary of it. In any case, this isn't about the factual details, it is about stuff much much deeper than that. If you are uncomfortable with the idea of anonymity, please don't respond. Also, I would like you to be below 30 ideally, but I don't really care because you could very well be 60 and tell me you are 20. However, I would hope that no one would want to drain six months pretending to be who they are not. If you do, then again, I won't be the one at a loss. I would like to use discord during the duration of our vulnerability experiment. I am not sure how many people would respond to this. If it ends up being one, I would go with that person. In any case, tell me about yourself in a couple of lines and more importantly, tell me why you are in the best place to take on something like this. I want you to be as excited as I am about this! Please do take time to think it over, considering your prior commitments, I would hate it if you decide to give up midway. Once you are on the roller coaster with me, it only stops after 6 months. I hope I don't change my mind about this before I find someone xD."

I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I'm not above bad sex or dick jokes. \-I love strong women (physically, mentally, strong will, decisive) and sometimes I want to lead and take care of someone, but other times I want to be pulled around and patted on the head. I love short hair and men's clothes on women too! comment"

So, I figured that I would head on over here. Just a disclaimer, I am open to anyone from any walk of life they may be in. I consider myself accepting and open to learn from all people. Anyway, my name is Austin and I have recently found some newfound success in my life. After the death of my adoptive mother roughly a year ago now, I fell into a somewhat depressive spiral. Now, Im completely off of anti-depressants. I feel that this growth in my life has lead me to seek out someone I care about to talk with and potentially strike up a friendship - maybe even more. I currently work in the cybersecurity field doing contract work for various companies and organizations. Its a decent job that has allowed me to travel and explore the world. That being said, I want to settle down in one single place soon. Im a big fan of almost all movie genres and really enjoy a night at a movie theater. Im an amateur chef who likes to experiment with new foods who likes to live on the wild side and not use recipes very often. Lol. I would love to continue talking about mutual interests, or even different interests through Reddit or another chatting app. I really hope that I get some orange envelopes and meet some fantastic people here.

I hope your answer is that you're doing well, but if not, maybe I can cheer you up. My name's Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a part time job, and is headed to college in the fall. As of recent, say a couple months or so, I've started going to bed feeling lonely every night. The problem isn't lack of friends or people to do things with, I've got plenty of stuff to do. The problem is lack of a person to love, care for, give attention to, and receive all of that back from. I want someone like this, and maybe that someone is you. In a perfect world we would have tons of stuff in common, find each other attractive, and connect immediately so these lonely nights can stop being so lonely. Let's start with interests I have. **Singing**. I've always sang for as long as I can remember. Starting my 6th grade year, I joined choir and have loved all of it, all the way up until I graduated high school about a month back. I hope I keep singing in some way, but for now I'm not entirely sure what way that'll be. **Video Games**. I don't play them as much as I used to, but I love RPGs like the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. I also enjoy the Halo and Titanfall games, as well as other random games. I mainly play on PC, but do have an Xbox One. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**. You may not even know what these are, but they are a rather large part of my life. Dungeons and Dragons may ring a few bells, but that's just one of the many different TTRPG games I enjoy. If you like medieval fantasy stuff, but have never really stumbled onto TTRPGs, I'd love to show you some time. **Writing**. I like to do a bit of writing here and there, primarily as world building. Medieval fantasy is my favorite, but I've also done a few fandom things as well with some of the above games I mentioned playing. **Watching YouTube**. Lots and lots of youtube. Too many different channels to name, but my favorite(s) would have to be Rooster Teeth and their other channels. If you've heard of them, that'd be a great starting off point to talk about. **History**. I love learning about history. Medieval, ancient Roman, American revolution, and more. It's just really interesting to me. **Music**. Well everyone likes music, right? I'm kinda weird about what I like though. I enjoy choral music because of my years in choir, as well as music from musicals. My favorite musical is Dear Evan Hansen, and it holds a large space in my heart. I also enjoy the occasional 80s song, especially Queen. **Networking and Cybersecurity**. This is what I'm headed to college for. I've already taken two years of classes in high school that have made me at least semi-prepared (or so I hope). Isn't a super interesting talking point, but just a little about my plans for the future. If you share any or all of these interests, send me a message. I'd love to talk to you. Ideally, you're around my age (the closer the better, but I'm not picky), share an interest or two, and want a committed relationship. It may be long distance and that's totally fine. I want to talk to you every day, lift your spirits, lull each other to sleep over a call or video chat, and more. I want to love you. I've never been in a relationship before, so I'm not sure how everything will go, but I want it all to go well. If you're in the same boat, we can work through it together. Here are my physical traits. I'll also send you picture as soon as you ask. It can be your first message if you want. Physical attraction is important, so I'd completely understand. Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently doing intermittent fasting to lose some weight, and so far it's working, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present Coming to a close, I do hope to whoever reading this that you find the person you're looking for. If that's me, then I'd be overjoyed, but if it isn't, that's okay too. Send me a message talking about anything. We'll talk a bit and hopefully find out we like each other. I mainly use discord, but also have snapchat and am willing to download any free app you prefer to talk on. Can't wait to talk to you. Have a great day. P.S. I'm a pretty reserved guy. I don't do drugs, smoke, vape, drink alcohol, or go to parties. I'm also pretty introverted. You don't have to be introverted, but if you regularly underage drink, do illegal drugs, or smoke heavily, this probably won't work out all that well. P.P.S. If we end up not hitting it off too well, please don't ghost. Being straight and honest isn't always the best choice depending on the person, but it is with me. I won't ghost you and you won't ghost me, deal?"

I am looking for a long term romantic partner.

Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present I'm not super attractive. I'd put myself as average before taking into account the acne, so below average with the acne. Hopefully I can get that cleared up sometime in the near future though! Next are a few things I find I enjoy in a girl: **Expressing Emotions**. Just in the way that she can express her emotions instead of hiding them away and also doesn't mind me expressing my emotions. I want us to be able to talk to each other with open ears about how we feel. **Caring and Affection**. My world would light up from getting a short message that says something like ""Hope work's going okay, big hugs!"". Just little signs of affection and stuff like that makes me so happy. **Wanting to Talk**. If we really like each other, I'm going to want to talk nonstop about anything and everything. As I exist now, I will literally never not want to be messaged. Double message me, triple message me, quadruple message me, whatever. I want to be messaged even if you know I can't really reply. Also falling asleep while on a voice or video call with someone that I've been talking to is a dream of mine. Last thing I want to say about myself is that I'm a pretty reserved guy. I'm introverted, never went out to parties, never drink, smoke, do drugs, vape, etc. You don't have to be introverted, but if you drink a lot/drink underage, do drugs, heavily smoke, party hard, etc, we probably won't work out. Also, if we end up not really clicking, I want you (and myself) to be able to be honest about it. No ghosting or anything, just straight up saying that it's not working out and why you (or I) think that it's not working out. Hope to get a reply and I hope to everyone that's read this far, even if you don't plan on messaging, that you find what you're looking for."

Before I start, thanks for stopping and reading one of the dozens of other posts. Even if you don't send a message, it's good to know I got at least a few of you past my 3/10 face. Why Should You Send Me a Message Over Someone Else?: Truth be told, there isn't any good reason. Everyone here deserves to find someone they can have a truly good relationship with, so good luck to everyone here. If you finish reading and find enough things you like about me to send a message, I'd love to talk, especially if you're in introvert like myself. Hobbies: - **Singing.** Having just graduated high school, my singing's sadly going to be put on the back burner, but all throughout middle and high school I was a huge choir nerd. I've been told I'm good, but regardless can't stand the sound of my own voice. I hope I can find a way to keep singing past high school. - **Video Games.** I don't play as much as I used to, but I still sit down and enjoy a good video game now and then. I'm a fan of RPGs like the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout, as well as some sci-fi games like Halo and Titanfall. There's others, but those are primarily what I play today. - **Tabletop RPGs.** If you don't know what that is, maybe the name Dungeon and Dragons catches the ear? If not, It's too hard to explain in this post, but I'm a huge fan of TTRPGs and play them on a regular basis. - **Watching way too much YouTube.** Pretty self explanatory. - **Writing.** This primarily goes hand in hand with TTRPGs, but I have branched out a little bit in writing other stuff. I love writing medieval fantasy stories for my TTRPG games and would love to branch out even more with an actual book or other form of media. - **Networking and Cybersecurity.** Not so much a hobby, but what I'm going into college for. Already took some courses in high school and hope I'm smart enough to continue through college. Pros: - **Very friendly.** I can and have made friends with anyone I spend time with. - Lots of free time. At least for the rest of summer, I'll only be working a part time job. Leaves a lot of time to talk. - **Trustworthy.** I like to consider myself a good and trustworthy person, but that shouldn't really be something someone has to point out about themselves if it's true, so that's all I'll say about it. - **Good at keeping conversations going.** Whether through natural progression of conversation or just completely segweying into new topics, I can keep a conversation flowing if the other person wants it. Cons: - **Well...you've seen my picture.** If that doesn't deter you though, then awesome. - **I'll probably message you way too often** because I have nothing better to do. - **I've never been in a relationship before,** so I'm sure I'm going to find out things about myself that add to both the pros and cons. If you made it this far, you are awesome. Wrapping things up, I'm looking for someone to have a relationship with because as of late, I've been feeling rather lonely. If any woman reading this feels the same, I'd love to make it go away. I'd like to talk to someone around my age, but I won't set a hard limit. I'm not attractive enough to be picky like that. This is my main account and I frequent many different subreddits. If you're wondering what to talk about when (and if) you message me, feel free to stroll through my posts, comments, whatever and see where my interests lie. Oh, and P.S If you're feeling nervous about sending me, or anyone for that matter, a private message, don't be. I was in the same boat for awhile and finally decided that if I'm going to get anywhere, I need to stop being so nervous. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hope to hear from at least one person. Thanks for reading."

This is a long one so buckle in. These are always weird to start, to let's start with what I'm looking for. - **Someone that wants a serious relationship**. I know I'm young, but I want someone I can wake up with a text from each morning and talk throughout the day as much as we can. Someone who wants to talk about stuff and things with me until the sun goes down, then keep talking until we're both too tired to continue. - **Someone with at least one or two shared interests as me**. You'll see them below. Even one is enough to make a connection with, so if you like even just one of my hobbies, I'd love to talk to you. - **Someone I can be honest with and who will be honest with me**. If we get to a point where maybe we think things aren't clicking as well as they should be, I want to talk about why that is and send each other off on good terms. - **Someone who is okay with long distance**. I don't care if we're halfway across the world from each other or neighbors that just have awkwardly never talked to each other until now. If we can make each other happy, that's all that matters right? And who knows. If it ends up working out really well, maybe we won't be long distance forever. - **Someone around my age**. The closer you are to my age, the better. I'm not unwilling to talk if you're in your mid twenties, but older than that and I think it starts getting a little weird. If you fit any and or all of the above, I think we'd get along nicely. Let's move on to physical traits. Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently trying intermittent fasting to lose some weight, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present If you message me and the first thing you ask is for a picture, I won't get offended. Physical attraction is important and I'm certainly not the most attractive guy. Hobbies: - **Singing**. I was in choir all throughout middle school and high school and would love to continue singing some way. I don't know if I will, but it'll always have a place in my heart for something that's shaped me as a person. I've been told I'm pretty good, but I hate the sound of my own voice so I don't really know. - **Writing**. I like writing stories. I mainly do this for tabletop role playing games, which I explain next, but sometimes just do some writing for whatever. Most often it's medieval fantasy stuff. - **Tabletop Role Playing Games**. If you have no idea what this is, don't worry. Maybe Dungeons and Dragons will ring a bell? If not, It's that thing that nerds do and that's about all I can say about it here without going on for too long, because this post is already getting lengthy. - **History**. Easily some of my favorite content to watch on youtube, my favorite subject in school, and overall piques my interest greatly. I love medieval history, ancient Roman history, and a few other time periods. - **Video Games**. I haven't played them as much as I used to, but I still enjoy a game every now and then. Games I like include the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Halo, Titanfall, Witcher, and other games that kind of fit those genres. I play mostly on PC, but do have an Xbox One as well. - **Watching Way Too Much Youtube**. This is pretty self explanatory, but I watch gaming channels, live action stuff, historical channels, and plenty more. - **Networking and Cybersecurity**. This doesn't really fit anywhere else and isn't really a hobby, but rather what I'm going into college for. Already took two years of courses through a program at high school, so I think I'm prepared (or I hope or I am). Last list, I swear. Pros and Cons: Pros - **I'm very friendly**. I have a decent amount of friends both on and offline. I've never really had a problem making friends and think I could make friends with anyone if I spent enough time with them. It's just my personality. - **I'm caring**. I'll never miss a moment to ask about your day or listen to ""what that bitch Patrice"" did at work today (if you get the reference, I already love you). I'll be here for you and hope that you'll be there for me when I need it. - **I can hold a conversation**. Something nice about myself is I can keep a conversation moving if the other person wants me to. Whether it be finding small things to talk about from an already existing conversation or just segweying into something completely different, I can keep us talking for as long as we need. Cons - **I've never been in a relationship before**. Closest I've ever come is talking to people on here for a couple days. If you want to hear more about why, I'll tell you. This means I don't really know everything that will happen in a relationship with me. More pros and cons might be added to this list in the future. - **I've already said it once**...but I'm not that attractive. Looks are important, especially for starting a relationship. If you see my picture and then say to me directly, without ghosting me, that it's a deal breaker, I won't be annoyed or mad. Knowing that, you may as well take a try right? Bringing this post to a close, I'd like to say that I hope at least one person will find me as someone they're looking for. These days have been pretty lonely and having someone I can care about and who cares about me would brighten my world. Even if you don't plan on messaging me, I'd like to say have a good day and I hope you find what you're looking for."

You've had a long day at work/school/whatever else. You're home now. You lie down on your bed, exhausted, defeated, just wanting to curl up in a ball. Maybe you feel like crying, maybe you don't. You get a message on your phone that says, ""I hope you had a good day! Or if you didn't, I hope it's better tomorrow. If you want to talk, about anything, I'm here. Would love to hear the sound of your voice."" It's from me, that guy you met on reddit a few days ago and started talking to. You decide to reply about how your day wasn't so good after all. We talk, maybe just message, maybe voice chat, maybe video chat. We just talk and your worries, stress, and (maybe) crying goes away. We both go to sleep happy. Hi there, my name's Gary. What you just read is what I want, regardless of which side I'm on. I've had days like that, times I've just curled up and cried. I didn't have anyone to talk to to make it better, but you can have me. The relationship I want is one with mutual support of one another.

Already took two years of courses through a program at high school, so I think I'm prepared (or I hope I am). Do you like anything I listed? Even if it's just one thing (and yes, that includes watching way too much YouTube), that means we have something happy in common. Something to bond over, talk about, and do together. How about my physical traits? Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently trying intermittent fasting to lose some weight, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present I'm also below average looking in general (damn, I'm good at hyping myself up), so if you ask for a picture sooner rather than later, I won't get offended. Physical attraction is important, and I'd rather it not get in the way once we're already formed a connection. How about some pros and cons of talking with (and hopefully forming a relationship with) me: Pros: - **I'm very friendly**. I have a decent amount of friends both on and offline. I've never really had a problem making friends and think I could make friends with anyone if I spent enough time with them. It's just my personality. - **I'm caring**. I want to hear about you. You're going to be important to me, and I want to show you just how important you are to me. Whether it be just short little messages throughout the day, listening for three hours about how your day was, or trying new things you're interested in, I want to be there for you. - **I can hold a conversation**.

How do you like spending your weekends, assuming they're free? Answers to any and all of these questions would be a great start to our conversation. Last section, I promise. This is the **bad zone**. Also known as the very few absolute deal breakers (and I do mean very few. I'm not in a position to be super picky) are listed and explained. **Drugs, Smoking, and Alcohol**. If you drink heavily or do illegal drugs, it is a deal breaker. Smoking isn't a deal breaker on its own, but it is a big downside. **Ghosting**. If you're used to talking to people on here or other sites for awhile then ghosting out of nowhere, save me the heart break. I understand if it's just kind of happened once or twice, but if you do it regularly, it's a deal breaker. **Age**. Pretty simple here. The closer to my age, the better. Mid-twenties is about the oldest I'll go. Any older and it just seems a little weird. If you connect with everything I've said and really already feel a connection and are in your late twenties, shoot me a message anyway. I'll talk to anyone and everyone, even if you are a bit older. And that's it! You've made it to the end. Now you decide if you want to message me or not. If you've had a good read, go for it. If a majority of what I said didn't pique your interest, then you can move on to find what you're looking for. Good luck to everyone."

I am from San Antonio, Texas and I am definitely attracted to women who are strong, willful, and ambitious. A strong woman could definitely make me weak in the knees and I could see myself being cuddled and being the small spoon (he he, jetpack!) When sick, down, or feeling vulnerable, I long for someone to treat me tenderly and affectionately with comforting strength. I have ambition and fire of my own. I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. Rescuing princesses is fine...but nothing lights my fire like a woman that can stand on her own. About Me \-I'm 5'11"" and 250 lbs just to be upfront. I am making progress on shaping myself to a more ideal physique. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. My career is very important to me. \-I am an agnostic unsure about the existence of a deity, and I am progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I am in school online at WGU studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about. I'm also studying Statistics in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, Blues Rock and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting, creepy, and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Payday 2. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! I have a semi-weekly group playing Werewolf. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and a homeowner. \-I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic! \-I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. [Pictures of myself.](URL"

632,cybersecurity,r4r,32 [M4F] VA/NoVa - If more people acted like there was no tomorrow they could really enjoy today,6,ay3tc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/ay3tc8/32_m4f_vanova_if_more_people_acted_like_there_was/,2019-03-07 07:55:09,"Good Afternoon / Evening r/r4r (I am always unsure what the cutoff for that is, I've gotten blasted for saying good afternoon this late so I figured I'd cover both) - I hope everyone is having a run o' the mill Wednesday. I just got back from a wedding in California for a friend whom I haven't seen (in addition to his family) in over 20 years (I grew up with him but he moved away in my early teens but we got back in touch on facebook in our college years) and it was everything I could have asked for in a reunion. Funny how despite how much time has passed his family and him showed the same kindness and warmth that I have come to expect from them - all around a very warm and fun moment in time to share - especially considering the fact we hadn't seen each other in so long. Now I am back in my desk in DC, at work, sad that I have to deal with this chilly AF weather (seriously, these conditions are inhuman and I am going to write a complaint to someone) and preparing for yet another one of my friends to get married next weekend (known this guy for 13+ years though he lives in VA also) this weekend - so arguably, this week is bookended by two weddings. Everyone seems to be in a mad dash to get to the alter and here I am just wanting simple validation and a conversation, different stokes I suppose...? Either way - that was the catalyst which urged me to post again on here as I am hoping (hope beyond hope, really) that there are some sane and like-minded women who don't feel *totally* pressured by the mad dash to marriage and instead prefer the conversational and relationship build-up and investment. There is a middleground (eyyy yo if you're dating for 7 years put a ring on it) but at the end of the day I think what I am looking for (and what I am hoping a woman is looking for also) is the shared understanding that relationships take work and effort , communication and time. I bet if we could snap our fingers and have a perfect situation I believe a lot of people would have - but we don't and that's OK - time invested = return on that investment - that's the name of the game. I am not going to claim I am always going to return 100% of the investment, sue me - I am human. Damn it though if I won't try. For all you Breaking Bad lovers - I don't do half-measures when it comes to these types of things. You're either in or your out. Waffling about and trying to be ambiguous or ""hard-to-get"" is sometimes cute but really it is more off-putting - and that's just me trying to be honest. I'd rather have the honesty upfront instead of being given breadcrumbs and told vaguely about which direction may be right. Lay it all out and let us have a conversation about it, dissect it, discuss it - postulate and debate it. I have my past that own and don't regret and make it a point to accept that every decision I have ever made - good, bad or in-between - has led me to this point writing this very post. If I am going to accept the person I am today I have to be OK with that and not regret those decisions, and I don't. I don't take myself too seriously and I can say that I try to be the more extroverted person in my group(s). I have a high energy motor (mad ENFP-T) and love the stage and center of attention as much as I do a quite room and a book or music. To cap-off this novel - as it says in the title I am 32 and live in Arlington / Rosslyn but wouldn't mind driving around (within 30 miles or even a couple hours depending) to get to know someone - sometimes, it just may be worth it. I currently am a government contractor doing some cybersecurity work for the government. I love my job, am extremely passionate and motivated about it (I lead a large team of \~ 17 people on a good day) and have to constantly be in ""high energy mode"" to make sure my teem can feed off my positive vibes and get the work they need to do done while also succeeding in their various projects. I got a big heart, or so I have been told - though bruised and beaten from relationships of yesteryears I do not let that deter me, that one person probably isn't going to give up looking for their counterbalance - why should I? I believe everyone has a story to tell and sometimes people just want someone to listen. So go on - what's your story? Thanks for reading :)"

I am from San Antonio, Texas and I am definitely attracted to women who are strong, willful, and ambitious. A strong woman could definitely make me weak in the knees and I could see myself being cuddled and being the small spoon (he he, jetpack!) When sick, down, or feeling vulnerable, I long for someone to treat me tenderly and affectionately with comforting strength. I have ambition and fire of my own. I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. Rescuing princesses is fine...but nothing lights my fire like a woman that can stand on her own. About Me \-I'm 5'11"" and 254 lbs. A visit to the doctor has prompted me to change my eating habits and I'm twenty pounds down since November. I'm proud of my progress and I'm determined to continue until my weight is normal. I am loving the way I look in the mirror and lifting weights at the gym is helping a lot. I wouldn't mind a gym buddy, especially someone to lift with. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. My career is very important to me. \-I am an agnostic unsure about the existence of a deity, and I am progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I am in school online at WGU studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying Statistics in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. I am also currently learning Swedish. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, Blues Rock and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting, creepy, and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, Payday 2, and RimWorld. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! I have a semi-weekly group playing Werewolf that I greatly enjoy, and I am learning and loving Mahjong. The competitive kind, not the solitaire puzzle kind. \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and aquariums. I love to play board games with my friends, if you enjoy board games or are willing to try, we already have a lot to connect on! \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent castle-house on a two-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones! \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic! \-Open to poly, just haven't tried it. I am bisexual. \-I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. [Pictures of myself.](URL"

My fall semester just ended, and I anticipate having more free time until classes resume next month. I'm not looking forward to job hunting, but I'd like to get a job working with computers instead of my current job making pizzas at a convenience store. In my free time, I enjoy reading, computer games (mostly strategy games), browsing Wikipedia and Reddit, cooking, following current events, writing, board games, tabletop roleplaying games (Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons), taking walks, stargazing, visiting museums, hiking, kayaking, canoeing, and traveling. I don't smoke or do drugs. I drink alcohol occasionally, though I prefer to drink coffee daily. I'm about 6' (1.8m) tall, straight, and white. Politically I lean left and I'm non-religious.

Im not looking for a relationship but I am looking for something meaningful. Im in the USA, mountain time zone. I am bisexual. Im a socially awkward Latina standing at 57. To be honest with you? I have shit social skills (working on improving bit by bit), I tend to make myself invisible, or I have a hard time trying to truly be myself without coming off as too weird or too stand offish. Ive quit leeching off social media. I have a ton of normal shitty experiences that caused me a lot of grief. All this I am working on. I guess Im looking to fill a void, which isnt right but I figure if I could find someone who SUPPORTS me as I fill that void within myself (instead of person being the filler) then Ill be alright. I am looking for someone that I can communicate with throughout the day. I get that shit happens, but otherwise just need a bond of some sort. I send a ton of long messages and thorough responses. Id love it if you were a conversational individual like this yourself. Im into DC universe comics and Marvel (R.I.P STAN LEE), Star Wars, Harry Potter (Ravenclaw &amp; Thunderbird), TV shows (SOA, The Magicians, This Is Us, Goldbergs, Modern Family, Etc), Film (The Butterfly Effect, Unbreakable &amp; Split, Horror Flicks, Blue Valentine, Lars &amp; The Real Girl, Etc), Forensics, True Crime, CyberSecurity, Math (No Im not fucking Einstein about it but I do enjoy it), Languages, Writing/Journaling, Reading. Also, I will be honest where sometimes I feel like Im faking sympathy or empathy. Like, I cant understand what youre going through nor can I emotionally connect usually, but I can tell you that I will do my best to guide you towards a better version of yourself. Im not perfect and I clearly have my own baggage. Im not expecting you to help me carry it, but I do expect you to be a decent human being - to me and yourself. If youve ever taken MBTI, I guess Im INFP. Im not that into it anymore. Im definitely an idealistic goofball though. Funny how I made a total scrubs reference in my title and forgot to mention it as my damn favorite tv show. Music is my medicine. I do enjoy sharing it with others and I could use someone to watch tv shows or movies with whenever. Please do attach a picture of yourself so I know who Im talking to. Mine is my display picture. I do prefer closer to my age and within the USA but Ill take what I can get. If you read this and we never cross paths, I want to say that I Hope life is good to you and that you are good to yourself. Life wont always be nice, though and thats when showing compassion to yourself and others is going to be more helpful than ever. Good luck on your journey. "

So right to the point, I'm a pre-everything trans woman still mostly presenting as a man, because this is Louisiana and transitioning is scary. But I'm working on it, and I don't look half-bad when I take the time to girl myself up a bit. Aside from that, I work in Cybersecurity. I'm a PC gamer, a tabletop RPGer, a lover of marvel comics, webcomics, the Parahumans web serials, Doctor Who, the works of Terry Pratchett, and all those other standard geeky interests. I'm bisexual, but strongly leaning toward preferring women. That said, I'm most interested in exploring the other side of my sexuality, if anything. Honestly, I'm still kind of figuring out my sexuality, I'm not even really sure WHAT I want. So I guess I'm just saying nothing's off the table? But really, mostly I'm in need of friends.

I am from San Antonio, Texas and a long time ago I discovered that I'm not into wispy princesses like some guys are. I am definitely attracted to women who are strong, willful, and ambitious. I'm not a sub, but I don't want to be in power or in charge all the time. A strong woman could definitely make me weak in the knees and bowing for head pats. I could see myself being cuddled and being the small spoon (he he, jetpack!) When sick, down, or feeling vulnerable, I long for someone to treat me tenderly and affectionately with comforting strength. I'm not going to be someone's house husband or bottom boy. I'm not looking for someone who'll overlook my strengths. I have ambition and fire of my own. I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. Rescuing princesses is fine...but nothing lights my fire like a woman that can stand on her own. About Me \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. \-I am agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I am in school online at WGU studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying Statistics, SQL, and Python in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. I am also currently learning Swedish. Any one that can tutor me in Swedish, Data Analysis, or Cybersecurity would be more than welcome. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, Blues Rock and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting, creepy, and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, Payday 2, Magic the Gathering Arena, and RimWorld. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and aquaria. I love to play board games with my friends, if you enjoy board games or are willing to try, we already have a lot to connect on! \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent castle-house on a two-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones! \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic! \-Open to poly, just haven't tried it. I am bisexual. \-I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. [Pictures of myself.](URL"

A bit about me: I'm a trans woman (yes, I have a dick; no, you cannot see the dick; no, if we get intimate, you may not touch the dick) and I'm bisexual (even though I lean way more towards finding men attractive). I'm also polyamorous, so if we do become more than friends, be prepared that it is something I'm likely to bring up in the future. Some interests of mine: * reading (mostly sci-fi and fantasy, but have recently begun reading more journalistic books. Right now, I'm reading Bob Woodward's new book. ) * TV shows: I love binge-watching TV shows. I'm currently working through Suits and then I have The Blacklist lined up. Feel free to give me some of your recommendations! * philosophical arguments about controversial topics. If a topic is controversial, I'll probably an opinion about it. I always love seeing if I can justify something that's controversial with logic, I find the process riveting. * computers/IT/security: I'm really into computers and cybersecurity. I'm going to study IT next year and I'm hoping to become a system administrator in the future. I'd like to keep this to Reddit PMs until we decide if we click enough to keep talking long-term. After that, I usually prefer to use WhatsApp to talk to people, but I do have a bunch of other apps. So feel free to let me know which one you'd rather use. Anyway, I don't want to share everything about me. The whole point is to get to know each other, after all. So go ahead and send me one of them orange envelopey things. Also, your picture gets mine :) "

(This seems like a good time to apologize for being overly fond of puns) **TL;DR: I'm looking for someone to talk to. This could take the form of friends, pen pals, or, if I'm extraordinarily lucky and somehow play my cards right, maybe even a girlfriend. I'm not picky.** I've been single since last December, and I haven't had much luck with (or interest in) dating apps. I don't have many friends that live nearby and, for better or worse, one thing I do miss about being in a relationship is having someone to talk to and make plans with. I'm currently working on a bachelor's degree in information technology and a master's degree in cybersecurity. To pay the bills, I currently work nights at a convenience store, but I'm working on finding a different job, which is unfortunately a job in itself. In my free time, I enjoy reading (fiction and nonfiction), writing (fiction), computer games (mostly strategy), browsing Wikipedia, cooking, following current events, board games, tabletop roleplaying games (Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons), taking walks, stargazing, visiting museums, hiking, kayaking, canoeing, and traveling. I don't smoke or do drugs, but I do occasionally drink alcohol. Politically I lean left and I'm non-religious. My Myers-Briggs type is INTJ. If any of this intrigues you, I hope to hear from you soon! Have a good day. :)"

When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. \-Someone who aspires to something in life and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway (not that I don't like their food), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" \-Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count. If Reddit PMs are drying up or just not a good medium, I can text, call, I'll meet in person, I know communication is different when you're not in person. Tell me about yourself, I want to get to know you as well. \-If you're offbeat, irreverent, not traditionally feminine, very tall, a tomboy, dress like a guy, have short hair, androgynous, or are just not in the social norm in some way, I'd love to get the chance to talk to you. I love military women as well! I'm not discouraging anyone from messaging me if you're interested in getting to know me, my eye for beauty just happens to be different than most others.

If you'd like to play, I'd love that! \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany.

I hope this Wednesday is going well, currently here in DC it's ~ 90 degrees and looks to be only getting hotter. Having posted and chatted with some fine folks in the past, I am looking for much of the same though I wouldn't mind if the conversations could be a little more meaningful and deeper. Having just took a personality test after a long while (ENFP-T) things tend to just make a lot more sense now. Honestly, and I am curious to know if anyone had this happen - last year I actually truly was an INFJ-T, which is weird because I honestly always felt closer to ENFP-T. I don't think I was *as* truthful to myself as I could have been the last time I took a test, or maybe I have just changed that much in a year - curious, very curious.... Either way I am just looking to have a meaningful conversation with someone, preferably around my age (25-34 is cool, though I won't shoo away anyone that wants to just have a interesting and insightful conversation) and simply looking to see where things go. I think the phrase ""looking for love"" has been used too often, while it may be true, that's not my goal. I am looking for a connection and to get to know people at a deeper love. I am not saying love agnostic, but definitely not the primary reason. I like to know people for who they are, what their desires are, their dreams and hopes and their passions. Getting to know what drives people is just as fun as getting to know the person themselves. A little more about me - Work in DC but live in Rosslyn. I work as a cybersecurity manager which I am pretty passionate about career-wise as I really love / enjoy what I do. 5""10, average-ish build (170lbs), workout 4 - 5 times a week so I keep myself in pretty decent shape. I am Indian / Pakistani and was born in DC (so ya, I'm brown) and have a beard that I am learning to keep groomed which is a lot of fun (who knew there were so many ways to keep a beard looking good). Pics are up for trading of course. Hope to hear from some wonderful people! Happy Wednesday!"

Friends, pen pals, dates, a girlfriend- maybe even all of those, if I'm particularly lucky. Haha. I have a friend's wedding later this summer, and it might be nice to have a date. It's been nearly six months since my first relationship ended. I've tried a few dating apps, but with few results. During the spring semester, classes and work kept me busy, but the semester ended a few weeks ago, and since I have more free time I've been thinking it might be interesting to meet new people. I don't have many friends that live nearby, and, for better or worse, one thing I do miss about being in a relationship is having someone to talk to and make plans with. I'm nearly finished with a bachelor's degree in information technology service management and have started taking graduate classes for a master's degree in cybersecurity. I'm not sure if I want to pursue cybersecurity, but I do know that I would like to find a job where I work with computers, in contrast to making pizza at my current job as a convenience store cook. In my free time, I enjoy reading, computer games (mostly strategy games), browsing Wikipedia and Reddit, cooking, following current events, writing, board games, tabletop roleplaying games (Pathfinder and Dungeons and Dragons), taking walks, stargazing, visiting museums, hiking, kayaking, canoeing, and traveling. I don't smoke or do drugs, but I do occasionally drink alcohol. Coffee is consumed frequently. My Myers-Briggs type is INTJ and I'm about 6' (1.8m) tall, straight, and white. Politically I lean left and I'm non-religious (in contrast to the conservative Christian area where I grew up). Send me a message if I've intrigued you. :)"

701,cybersecurity,r4r,"28 [M4F] East Coast / NA / East Asia  Just pretend this was an interesting title. Also, totally posting for a ""friend.""",2,8j8xut,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/8j8xut/28_m4f_east_coast_na_east_asia_just_pretend_this/,2018-05-14 12:24:39,"Definitely posting this for a friend. So, if you also have a friend who might be interested in my friend then feel free to have your friend send mine a message. Obviously, Im writing this on their account- for obvious reasons. My friend thinks hes probably looking for something that starts as an online thing. He doesnt really believe hes going to find the kind of person he likes where hes currently at, so hes open to people from most anywhere. He would like to move to a state along the East Coast at some point in the near future, so hes interested in hearing from people on that side of the continent or would also like to be on that side of the continent maybe. I stole his drivers license. It says hes 510, weighs 160lbs. He doesnt look like he eats very much, but he definitely does. He has hazel eyes and red hair- though personally, I think it looks more like a dirty-blond now. He sometimes wears glasses when hes trying to be more smarter. My friend works in IT. Hes currently in the military- but I would never have known that if he didnt tell me. I think he said his contract is ending soon. Hes got a B.S. in Management (general) that he doesnt use because he found IT work to be much more enjoyable and hes probably going to get his masters in either IT Management or Cybersecurity. I asked him what he was looking for in a girl. He said physically they would ideally be shorter than him and height/weight proportional. He has a preference for Asian and Hispanic- but really, hes open to any race. He thinks hed do well with another laid-back person, mostly indoors type, He told me a bunch of really weird things he liked, so I came up with a much more normal list for him. Not all-inclusive, but its a start  He likes video games (mostly on PC). Not a whole lot of shooters though. Likes cooperative stuff, RPGs, Stardew Valley/Harvest Moon, some sims, rhythm games, Tabletop Simulator. He also likes board and card games.  Hes into almost any genre of movie, but his favorites are comedies and sci-fi/action. His favorite TV shows include The Office, Its Always Sunny, Impractical Jokers, Stranger Things, The Walking Dead, etc. He started getting into Anime as well.  His music tastes include most forms of Rock, as well as Korean Hip-hop and Pop. Some of his favorite bands are Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, CCR, Imagine Dragons, SHINee.  He's a big fan of Italian, Mexican, Chinese and Korean food. He is NOT a fan of spicy stuff though.  He loves comedy. Dark jokes, dad jokes, bad jokes, ~~hes a joke~~ (ignore that one) Louis CK, Mitch Hedberg, Demetri Martin and Bo Burnham kind of stuff.  Hes mostly indoors-y but he has been snow and water-skiing a fair bit and really likes both of them. He also likes beaches, swimming, hiking and biking. He is a fan of amusement/water parks, festivals, fairs, carnivals and conventions.  He does like to travel when the opportunity presents itself. He said he would love to get to live in either Korea or Japan if he maybe found work out there (hence East Asia in the title).  He is a really big animal person and would love to have a pet. He likes cats the most but is open to really any kind of pet you can well, pet. He does have a few deal-breakers, which I think are pretty reasonable all things considered Hes not really a fan of drug and tobacco use. Hes okay with social drinking. He definitely does not like to debate politics or religion and would not get along with someone who doesnt like animals. And well, Im posting this for him- so it goes without saying hes not the most social butterfly. He does try and is a really nice dude overall, but he needs a little time to get comfortable with and open up to someone. If you were to get along with him, he would really like it if you had Discord too. I think he wants to be able to play games and watch shows/movies and stuff with someone- idk, because Im not him of course."

I know thats pretty hard to start relationships online but Im gonna try my luck. A little background why Im posting here: I was raised a Jehovahs Witness, which if you didnt know is a cult of sorts. On top of that my parents, while great people and very caring, were extremely strict. Therefore I wasnt allowed to do any sort of extracurricular activities at school, no sports, not allowed to go to prom, not allowed to have a girlfriend, not allowed to go to other peoples houses, and not allowed to have other peoples phone numbers/social media accounts. So, long story short, Ive grown up with only a few friends who Ive since lost because I left the church/cult, so Im turning to my favorite website to hopefully find someone since my options are somewhat limited as it is. (leaving the JWs results in shunning from friends and family) I work full time at a cybersecurity firm, a position I was very lucky to get as its great and I love my coworkers. I love anything outdoors, art, music, all that good stuff! So, if youre still reading this after my vent session and, feel free to PM me! Id love to get to know someone and who knows what will work out. Thanks for reading!"

As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" -Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count.

March feels like it is coming and going and with the weather in DC being a cool 33 almost every day I am so looking forward to Spring! I hope everyone has had a good week - it's been a roller coaster for me that's for sure. I live and work in Arlington doing contracting in the cybersecurity field - it's slowly but surely has become a genuine passion of mine and working in this industry - I love growing and expanding my skills and knowledge and am always striving to be better than I was yesterday. I'd love to get to know someone who is down to earth and motivated but really doesn't take themselves too seriously. We are only human and as such we can only be expected to act within our means. I think trying to shove people in a box they don't fit into is one of the bigger pitfalls in relationships. Be you and I will be me - if that doesn't jive then at least we know we were ourselves. With me what you see is what you get - I am sick of the games and the cloak and dagger relationship process(es). I like to go out or stay in, be social or not - I am extremely versatile and as long as the company is great I can find comfort in any situation. I pride myself on my extroverted nature and will talk to the pants off anybody to get to know them better. I love to know what drive peoples' decision making and their choices - it is a true window into a person's soul! At 31 I am annoyed but also just exhausted with the plethora of dating apps and avenues one must pursue just to get a coffee or a night out on the town. I think the unnecessary pressure we put on ourselves to either ""figure things out"" or ""keep things moving"" do everyone a disservice as the journey is not being properly relished. Getting to know people and learning the deeper parts of intellect and insights are the finer things in life. I'd much rather have a solid and deep conversation than go to a bar to get blasted for a night. Hope there are some women who just want honesty and truth - I don't mince words. If you want to trade pics I am all for it! Have a great evening / weekend!"

It's dumb, really -- I didn't even drop my phone in the toilet, or in the sink, or spill water on it... There's just a mysterious small water spot on the side, and of course my stubborn ass self had to get one of the notoriously most-difficult phones to take apart on the market, so here I am. Hi there! I've posted here before, but that was last year and I've apparently changed quite a bit, so here's some stuff about me you're probably interested in hearing before you message me! I'm a second year college student studying International Politics with a concentration in National Security, minoring in Security and Risk Analysis. I'm at my flagship state university and as of this semester, successfully snuck my way into the honors program! Central PA doesn't have much to offer (compared to my hometown in suburban Philadelphia), but it's been growing on me over the past two years and I'm having a blast. Actually, if you're in the general field of cybersecurity or have any wisdom to offer about national security, please let me know! I'm relatively aimless right now and gearing up for a career fair next week to try and get an internship for the summer. Oh, of course I have to insert the disclaimer here that I am **NOT INTERESTED in sexual conversation**. Please do not attempt to steer me in that direction, because I will cease responding. *(Copy/paste below, cause this part hasn't changed, at least!)* Music is hugely important to me, and I tend to love when people I speak to have a similar taste! Lido is my favorite producer, but I'm terrible at favorites and genre-naming. I generally point towards future beats, but lately have been more into a nichey rap/hip-hop side of future beats. I have an EDM background and have gone to a fair amount of shows in the past, so I'm reasonably familiar with a broad spectrum of sounds. I also sing and play a bit of guitar, piano, violin, and drums! As a subset of ""EDM culture"", I'm also very passionate about something called the flow arts. It's a great conversation starter if you'd love to know more, but if you're already familiar with it all, I flow/levi wand and orbit mostly, with a sprinkle of poi! *(End pasting)* I'm pretty involved with the ""gaming club"" at my school, and I'm active on Overwatch (peaked at high plat, currently mid plat and dropping because the community is *completely* non-toxic). I'm running on a laptop for my system so I'm pretty limited, but I have enjoyed the heck out of Starbound, Warframe (longtime veteran player), and Fortnite (getting back into this) in the past! If you take a look at my old posts, you'll notice I am completely basing this one off of whatever I wrote previously so continuing on... I do still lift, but unfortunately am no longer affiliated with the club here at my university (dues/fees were WAY too pricey this year!). I realized I needed to fix my eating habits in order to continue to progress, so I reset my lifestyle and have recently gotten back into regular lifting. I'm a noodle currently (which is a bummer, cause I made a lot of newbie gains last year), but I'm optimistic for the future! On the surface, I am 5'4"" and Korean (born and fluent in the language)! If you've made it this far in this wall of text, send me your favorite story about a physical scar (like, on your skin.. y'know...) you have! "

730,cybersecurity,r4r,29 [M4F] East Coast - Can you scale my wall of text?,6,7llhjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/7llhjv/29_m4f_east_coast_can_you_scale_my_wall_of_text/,2017-12-23 11:35:59,"The first sentence is always just as awkward as the title though. Anyways, Ive posted here before, and while Ive talked to some interesting people, things usually fizzle out or we arent looking for the same things. Ive decided rather than going on and on about things I like (which often has a lot of the same things that most redditors enjoy), I should post something more detailed about myself as a person and what I am looking for in another person. I guess this is the part where I talk about myself a lot. Everyone loves doing this, right?! Lets start with the basic and boring stuff. Im a 29 year old male. I have a very, very useful degree in History which serves the purpose of allowing me to indicate Im university educated. I work in cybersecurity, and it's a pretty fun job most of the time. This is the part where I try to talk about myself as a person, and feel slightly (or extremely) douchey while doing so. Although I treat most things seriously and am often very self-conscious, I much prefer lightheartedness and humor whenever possible. Which is all the time, in my opinion. I also type like a robot, which doesnt match my verbal diction in the slightest. I think maybe Ill go all out and present various traits in bullet formats, while cringing and curling my toes in embarrassment while doing so: * Im usually a bit critical of most everything (excluding people) in my life or anything I participate it. It may rub some people the wrong way, but I genuinely am an optimistic and happy person. I think perfection is sort of pointless, and being able to improve upon something you enjoy only makes that experience better. Without being able to identify flaws, you cant really improve anything or enhance enjoyment. * Im an ambitious person. I study 5-10 hours a week to continue to build upon my knowledge and add formal training/certifications to augment my resume and enhance my career opportunities. Im certainly not a workaholic, but I genuinely want to be able to offer any family I may have as much as/more than what my parents offered me as a child or as much as my father offered my mother. * I would like to think Im a nice person to people I care about. Its subjective, and Im damn sure not perfect, but I take it very seriously to be punctual, respectful, loyal, and honest to anyone I value in my life. I will admit that I could probably be nicer to everyone rather than the people important to me. * I will laugh at everything. I dont drama or serious situations all the time; theyre quite draining. I also prefer to directly engage any emotions or issues which may get in the way of being happy. Oh, and fuck passive aggression. Unless its to people in the work place. Thats fair game. * Im an introverted person/INFJ (if that really matters to you). With that said, Im not the type of person to refuse going out with my SO/friends. I enjoy being alone, but its not so bad that being around people will cause an excessive drain on me or make me uncomfortable in any way. Unless its something ridiculous, like going to see Magic Mike. Then I may try to finagle my way out of it. Are you titillated and riveted my numerous super qualifications as a stellar human? Well, as for what Im looking for in a person: * Some form of ambition or drive. You dont have to be rich or powerful, but having the drive to do something well or be extremely passionate about a topic is an attractive quality. * Independent/Strong-willed. Im not going to rely on you for everything in my life, and I dont expect the same in return. Being able to be yourself, while being able to truly enjoy being with someone, is very important. * Intelligence, and to a lesser extent, knowledge. I like being the dumber of the two in a relationships. Im not the smartest man in the world, and I will end up respecting the hell out of you if you make me feel dumb (in a non-masochistic sort of way). * Shared interests are always cool too. I like a lot of things. Id like to like things with you. Lets like things together. * If applicable, someone who isnt terrified of distance (temporarily, anyways). I dont think its normal to enjoy the distance part of an LDR, but if anything progresses beyond friendship, being able to cope with the difficulties that come along with the distance is important. I have pictures too, and Id gladly trade them in messages. Looks arent everything, but to say they dont matter is just untrue in my opinion. If you read this far, you should probably message me. I wouldnt want to read all that crap for no reason."

Self proclaimed optimistic nihilist. Enjoying the curse of life and being thankful for the beauty in the absurdity and ambiguity of it. Currently working my ass off to get myself a better life and swap careers from the automotive to the Cybersecurity industry. So I don't have a lot of time to go out. Some things I'm into include: classic literature, computer science, Dadaism comedy(I.E. Eric Andre, Tim &amp; Eric, Andy Kauffman), sports, metal music(The Black Dahlia Murder, After The Burial, Carnifex, Thy Art Is Murder..) and most music in general I'll probably have a lot in common with you. Things I'm looking for: someone funny, caring, someone who can hold a good conversation. I'm also pretty weak willed when it comes to a nice ass ;) Straight out of a hall mark card^ XD As cheesy as it sounds I just wanna connect with someone and talk and see where things go. Distance doesn't matter to me. Willing to meet if the chemistry is there I have a lot to give and have never had that reciprocated towards me. PM me if interested:) "

A few things he is doing with his life is: Trying to get back into good enough shape to run a half a marathon next year without wanting to die, and trying to make new friends who want to explore more nature as well as cities(Nashville is his favorite city he visited so far). &amp;nbsp; **Product Information** Education Details| &amp;nbsp; ---|--- High School| Completed 2009 College: UMUC| In progress (Graduation May 2019) Bachelor in Networks and CyberSecurity &amp;nbsp; Work Details| &amp;nbsp; ---|--- Army| Active Duty 25B Nov 2011 - July 2017 Current Job| Working for a IT contractor company while waiting for the Govt to do its things.

One for posting on those NSFW subReddits and the other one for normal stuff. It always puzzled him. Yes Jgatling09 is judging you. Females he'd love to know what you think about people who use only one account for both. Does it affect your judgement on them? He does not like when people talk bad about the military. While yes you're able to have your own opinion, he will always love his brothers and sisters in arms. So don't insult them please unless you've served yourself. Specially in the first few messages of talking :/. He is a firm believer of having to be friends first before being in a relationship. The saying goes you marry your best friend. He is not one to develop feelings over text/chat right away in the first week. While you may sound awesome and amazing through conversation, he likes to let feelings develop. Think the movie What If with Daniel Radcliffe(Harry Potter) and Adam Driver(Kylo Ren). Please understand he is a full time student and works full time. He can't really text while at work so if you require a response right away while he is at work, it probably wont work out. He will text you good morning while at the gym and once he is off work. TV/Movie dates are great for long distances. Also video games and watching hockey. Technology! Guess what, he has flaws. What are they? Oh, he doesn't know. He sings in the shower. Sometimes he spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally he'll hit somebody with his car. So sue him... No, don't sue him. That is the opposite of the point that he is trying to make. -If you get this, we'll get along great. Rewatching this show for the 900th time. &amp;nbsp; **Customer questions &amp; answers** **Question:** Is he religious? **Answer:** He is not. He's agnostic and cool with whatever you practice/follow. Willing to attend church on some Sundays. **Question:** What is he looking for in a potential prospect? **Answer:** He is looking for an individual who he vibes with honestly. He's dated nerds in the past, and also those who weren't nerds. Someone who is honest, down to earth, and semi-healthy.

Hey there, I'm Tim. I am a cybersecurity analyst currently working and living in Indiana. As I am originally from Connecticut, I often seem out of place in rural Indiana with my dress shirts, trench coats, and bomber jackets in the sea of hunter orange and realtree. I have a huge interest in military history, computers, and men's classic style (not something I fell into intentionally, I just wanted to look presentable at college and it all spiraled out of control). When I am not at work or on my computer, I still volunteer as an advisor for a venturing crew or, cost permitting, spend time at the range practicing with my pistol. Lastly, I am an INTJ. If you put stock in that, that's great, if not, no big deal. I've found myself in a situation where I don't live in a part of Indiana where there are a large meeting areas and while I have tried multiple online dating apps, I just haven't found anyone who I've clicked with so far and wanted to see if reddit can remedy that issue. I am looking for someone very strong willed and sharp witted. I love nothing more than a good debate and love figuring out how others think. I am incredibly sarcastic and really enjoy getting sarcasm thrown back at me. If you also think making other people question why we are together is an entertaining idea, shoot me a PM and we will see how things progress. I will likely want to move any conversation to Discord after the initial sets of PMs. "

About Me --- -I am 5'11"" at 269 lbs at 35% body fat, not going to shy away from that, but I am working on it. -I hit the gym at least four times a week after work for strength training. -I am Agnostic and I am liberal in my politics. -I work at UT Health Science Center as IT Support. I love my job. -I am working to get into UTSA's Cybersecurity Master's program. -I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting and educational ones, I am getting into Stranger Things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. -I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. -Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing Charcuterie. -I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent house on a ten-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. -I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. Not kidding, I am a pretty emotional person.

If Reddit PMs are drying up or just not a good medium, I can text, call, I'll meet in person, I know communication is different when you're not in person. Tell me about yourself, I want to get to know you as well. -If you're offbeat, irreverent, not traditionally feminine, very tall, a tomboy, a boi, dress like a guy, have short hair, androgynous, or are just not in the social norm in some way, odds are I'll be very interested in you. I'm not discouraging anyone from messaging me if you're interested in getting to know me, my eye for beauty just happens to be different than most others.

Socializing has never been one of my strong points, so I mostly stay inside and play video games. I enjoy most music, but my favorite is dubstep and EDM. I'm taking online classes to go into the cybersecurity field, with plans on getting a government job. I have four cats (I love animals) named Lil Bit, Muffin, Sweet Pea and Cody. Cody is ""my"" cat, and the rest are my mom's. He is a big, fat white cat with black spots and he loves to snuggle. All of my cats are rescues and I care very much for them. I consider myself to be a very creative and intelligent person, but my major flaw is that I have low motivation. I would have gotten straight A's in school if I had done my homework (which is, for the most part, pointless busy work; that's the way the schools in America work, though) and applied myself a little more. I want to be more active, but I get bored running alone. If I had a running buddy that could help me push myself, and make me go outside once in a while, I would be in a lot better shape. I enjoy deep discussions about philosophy, metaphysics and hypothetical scenarios, among other topics. One of my favorite things to do is analyse movies and find parallels between them and classic philosophy (like Fate vs Free Will in The Matrix). I'm also open to silly discussions (like how much Quentin Tarantino's face looks like a croissant.) Sorry about the disjointedness of this post, but I can be a little scatterbrained at times, and I've never been that good at describing anything, much less myself. "

786,cybersecurity,r4r,"32[M4F] San Antonio, TX - Role Reversal",1,5vmh6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/5vmh6h/32m4f_san_antonio_tx_role_reversal/,2017-02-23 10:55:49,"As the post says, I love a bit of role reversal in a relationship. I love women that are strong, forward, willful, not afraid to speak their mind, not afraid to throw down on a video game or a game of 7 Wonders or Dominion. Someone that can be aggressive and playful and dominant, but is comfortable when I am those things as well. I am not looking for a princess to rescue or to be someone's prince in distress, I'm looking for an equal. Mostly I find myself desiring women that are strong, willful, and act firmly and forcefully. As I've grown and found more confidence in myself and who I am, my understanding of what I'm attracted to and what I want in a relationship has changed a lot. In my twenties, I found myself lovelorn, with little confidence in myself, and pining for a broken girl to fix or a princess for me to rescue. When I grew out of that and started to find direction and focus in my life, my interests in women changed a lot and now I'd find myself far more attracted to a lady knight than a princess waiting to be rescued. I don't want someone to need me, I want someone who wants to be with me, who chooses me. I'm not a sub and I won't always want to be the passive one in a relationship, but I am deeply attracted to women what have strength, ambition, and will take what they want, and sometimes that means a slap on the butt or taking a kiss or spooning me, and has some room for give and take. A saying to summarize it I have found is that when the times are tough, I'd much rather have someone that will stand by my side, spear and shield in hand, then someone that will hide in the shade of my protection. Some things I look for in a partner are strength (mostly of mind, but I love strength of body), ambition, willfulness, someone seeking the next goal, intelligent, playful, someone not afraid to express themselves or share their emotions, someone who is comfortable with their sexuality, someone that can cuddle, hug, and can be understanding. I'm also deeply attracted to tomboys, androgynous women, bois, tall women, gals in masculine clothing, but this is by no means exclusive! About myself, I currently work at a university library as a shift supervisor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in History and another in English Literature and I am currently going to school for a Master's in Cybersecurity to make a career in that field. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list. I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world? Is reality completely different and we're just doing the best with the information we have? -Does morality have a role with humans? Do our laws make us better or worse as a whole? -Is Capitalism the best (read that as fairest) economic system we have? -Is truth objective, subjective, or both? -Does bureaucracy help or hinder the legislative process? (i.e. bureaucracy is a slow and cumbersome process, does it help in preventing bad laws conceived on emotion or autocratic laws, or does it merely hinder the passing of progressive and good laws.) -The Trump presidency in thoughtful and rational conversation. -How do we handle the increase in automation of most jobs? -Why do conservatives think and vote the way they do? -Anything else you want to debate on. I'm not looking for someone to just parrot responses to me, if you disagree that's fine, that's great, challenge me."

A saying to summarize it I have found is that when the times are tough, I'd much rather have someone that will stand by my side, spear and shield in hand, then someone that will hide in the shade of my protection. Some things I look for in a partner are strength (mostly of mind, but I love strength of body), ambition, willfulness, someone seeking the next goal, intelligent, playful, someone not afraid to express themselves or share their emotions, someone who is comfortable with their sexuality, someone that can cuddle, hug, and can be understanding. I'm also deeply attracted to tomboys, androgynous women, bois, tall women, gals in masculine clothing, but this is by no means exclusive! About myself, I currently work at a university library as a shift supervisor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in History and another in English Literature and I am currently going to school for a Master's in Cybersecurity to make a career in that field. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list. I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world? Is reality completely different and we're just doing the best with the information we have? -Does morality have a role with humans? Do our laws make us better or worse as a whole? -Is Capitalism the best (read that as fairest) economic system we have? -Is truth objective, subjective, or both? -Does bureaucracy help or hinder the legislative process? (i.e. bureaucracy is a slow and cumbersome process, does it help in preventing bad laws conceived on emotion or autocratic laws, or does it merely hinder the passing of progressive and good laws.) -The 2016 Election in a thoughtful and rational conversation. -How do we handle the increase in automation of most jobs? Will ""work"" be an outdated concept given enough time? -Why do conservatives think and vote the way they do? -Anything else you want to debate on. I'm not looking for someone to just parrot responses to me, if you disagree that's fine, that's great, challenge me."

I'm going to say exactly what's on my mind and what I'm looking for. The first thing I'm looking for is absolute honesty. Not a complete lack of tact, or intentionally trying to wound someone, just being honest enough to say something when beating around the bush doesn't drive the point home. Don't want to talk anymore? Not interested in meeting up? Then just say so, it's quicker in the long run and it saves a lot of pain and heartache when someone is wondering if they'll ever hear from you again. I'm looking for someone ambitious, driven, and who is willing to, if not already, take steps towards success. Someone who dreams big and won't just sit around waiting. I'm at the foot of a very tall mountain, but I'm starting and I'm committed. Right now I have a Bachelor's in English Literature and a Bachelor's in History and I work at a university library. It's a well enough job and I like the people that I work with, but there's not a lot of opportunity that I'm content with. I'm pushing to get into cybersecurity and to that end I'm going back to school to pursue a Master's degree, and next year I'm considering joining the Air Force Reserve. I want to be a professional and I'm starting now. Well, technically two weeks ago, but you understand. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well.

I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some bonuses, but don't feel these are hard requirements, they're not: -If you're adorkable, geeky, or nerdy -If the terms androgynous, tomboy, or boi apply to you -Really tall and/or really strong (I'm not put off by these things like some guys are, I adore them!) -Dominant personality, strong willed, ect. -You can run with a joke and don't mind dirty jokes either (I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor) -You're looking for a workout partner -You're not afraid to open up (I can be pretty open with my emotions) Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world?

794,cybersecurity,r4r,"32[M4F] San Antonio, TX - Role Reversal",13,5nfcd4,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/5nfcd4/32m4f_san_antonio_tx_role_reversal/,2017-01-12 09:30:31,"As the post says, I love a bit of role reversal in a relationship. I love women that are strong, forward, willful, not afraid to speak their mind, not afraid to throw down on a video game or a game of 7 Wonders or Dominion. Someone that can be aggressive and playful and dominant, but is comfortable when I am those things as well. I am not looking for a princess to rescue or to be someone's prince in distress, I'm looking for an equal. Mostly I find myself desiring women that are strong, willful, and act firmly and forcefully. As I've grown and found more confidence in myself and who I am, my understanding of what I'm attracted to and what I want in a relationship has changed a lot. In my twenties, I found myself lovelorn, with little confidence in myself, and pining for a broken girl to fix or a princess for me to rescue. When I grew out of that and started to find direction and focus in my life, my interests in women changed a lot and now I'd find myself far more attracted to a lady knight than a princess waiting to be rescued. I don't want someone to need me, I want someone who wants to be with me, who chooses me. I'm not a sub and I won't always want to be the passive one in a relationship, but I am deeply attracted to women what have strength, ambition, and will take what they want, and sometimes that means a slap on the butt or taking a kiss or spooning me, and has some room for give and take. A saying to summarize it I have found is that when the times are tough, I'd much rather have someone that will stand by my side, spear and shield in hand, then someone that will hide in the shade of my protection. Some things I look for in a partner are strength (mostly of mind, but I love strength of body), ambition, willfulness, someone seeking the next goal, intelligent, playful, someone not afraid to express themselves or share their emotions, someone who is comfortable with their sexuality, someone that can cuddle, hug, and can be understanding. I'm also deeply attracted to tomboys, androgynous women, bois, tall women, gals in masculine clothing, but this is by no means exclusive! About myself, I currently work at a university library as a shift supervisor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in History and another in English Literature and I am currently going to school for a Master's in Cybersecurity to make a career in that field. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list. I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world? Is reality completely different and we're just doing the best with the information we have? -Does morality have a role with humans? Do our laws make us better or worse as a whole? -Is Capitalism the best (read that as fairest) economic system we have? -Is truth objective, subjective, or both? -Does bureaucracy help or hinder the legislative process? (i.e. bureaucracy is a slow and cumbersome process, does it help in preventing bad laws conceived on emotion or autocratic laws, or does it merely hinder the passing of progressive and good laws.) -The 2016 Election in a thoughtful and rational conversation. -How do we handle the increase in automation of most jobs?

Not a complete lack of tact, or intentionally trying to wound someone, just being honest enough to say something when beating around the bush doesn't drive the point home. Don't want to talk anymore? Not interested in meeting up? Then just say so, it's quicker in the long run and it saves a lot of pain and heartache when someone is wondering if they'll ever hear from you again. I'm looking for someone ambitious, driven, and who is willing to, if not already, take steps towards success. Someone who dreams big and won't just sit around waiting. I'm at the foot of a very tall mountain, but I'm starting and I'm committed. Right now I have a Bachelor's in English Literature and a Bachelor's in History and I work at a university library. It's a well enough job and I like the people that I work with, but there's not a lot of opportunity that I'm content with. I'm pushing to get into cybersecurity and to that end I'm going back to school to pursue a Master's degree, and next year I'm considering joining the Air Force Reserve.

For the sake of forthrightness, I'm 237 (as of Sunday morning) and 5' 11"", just a hair under six even. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list. I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship.

Is reality completely different and we're just doing the best with the information we have? -Does morality have a role with humans? Do our laws make us better or worse as a whole? -Is Capitalism the best (read that as fairest) economic system we have? -Is truth objective, subjective, or both? -Does bureaucracy help or hinder the legislative process? (i.e. bureaucracy is a slow and cumbersome process, does it help in preventing bad laws conceived on emotion or autocratic laws, or does it merely hinder the passing of progressive and good laws.) -The 2016 Election in a thoughtful and rational conversation. -How do we handle the increase in automation of most jobs?

Not interested in meeting up? Then just say so, it's quicker in the long run and it saves a lot of pain and heartache when someone is wondering if they'll ever hear from you again. I'm looking for someone ambitious, driven, and who is willing to, if not already, take steps towards success. Someone who dreams big and won't just sit around waiting. I'm at the foot of a very tall mountain, but I'm starting and I'm committed. Right now I have a Bachelor's in English Literature and a Bachelor's in History and I work at a university library. It's a well enough job and I like the people that I work with, but there's not a lot of opportunity that I'm content with. I'm pushing to get into cybersecurity and to that end I'm going back to school to pursue a Master's degree, and next year I'm considering joining the Air Force Reserve. I want to be a professional and I'm starting now. Well, technically two weeks ago, but you understand. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. For the sake of forthrightness, I'm 250 (as of yesterday morning) and 5' 11"", just a hair under six even. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. Some bonuses, but don't feel these are hard requirements, they're not: -If you're adorkable, geeky, or nerdy -If the terms androgynous, tomboy, or boi apply to you -Really tall and/or really strong (I'm not put off by these things like some guys are, I adore them!) -Dominant personality, strong willed, ect. -You can run with a joke and don't mind dirty jokes either (I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor) -You're looking for a workout partner -You're not afraid to open up (I can be pretty open with my emotions)"

I'm part of the Pokemon GO craze! Running, archery, hiking, I love to discover new trails in San Antonio. I'm huge on board gaming too. I love to go to the movies!

I work at a library at UTSA and I'm looking to get into IT, so tech talk interests me too, especially from a professional in the field! College educated with two BAs, History and English. Aside from the above, what am I looking for? Well, first and foremost, write me up and find out! I'm always interested in talking to geeks (I think adorkable is an awesome word) and gamers. I'm a bit of a grown up child at heart and I'd love someone I can be silly and immature with, while still holding to my goals and ambitions and working towards them. Would love a mentor and tutor for coding, ethical hacking, InfoSec and Cybersecurity, and IT in general. Tall girls, short hair, and tomboys are all a plus. I love anyone that's rough and tumble, not afraid to be immature, and is more of a warrior than a princess. I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, so sex-plus is a big plus. Challenge me physically and intellectually and I will do the same. I really admire strength, will, ambition, and go-getter attitudes! [Here](URL is a photo of me as is the custom here.

Also, while it does say Las Vegas, that's just where I happen to be and the optimal stuff, I'm open to longer distance stuff if there's something that might come of it. Also as it says I'm a trans-woman and I'd say I'm a lesbian. I'm still in the relatively early stages of my transition, but I'm presenting woman full time now and I do have boobs.... though they are small. I'm also really tall and am working on losing weight and developing curves. I'm undecided on the future of what surgeries I will choose to undergo as of right now. I'm putting this out there so if you're interested, you know what you're getting into. I should mention, when I say tall, I mean 6'4"".... so there's that. Oh and I'm working on my voice, trying to feminize it, progress has been made, but it fluctuates on how well I can do it each day. I am also a gamer, I play on basically every platform, loving Overwatch right now. I am going to ITT-Tech for Network Systems Admin and eventually Cybersecurity after I get my associates. I like a lot of Sci-Fi and fantasy stuff, favorite Sci-Fi book being Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and my favorite fantasy series is The Alchemyst and it's following books (the series name is really long). Anyway, if there's more you want to know let me know, I'll add it to this post in edits. I hope to hear something soon. :)"

849,cybersecurity,r4r,27 [M4F] East Coast - Can you scale my wall of text?,13,47z2u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/47z2u0/27_m4f_east_coast_can_you_scale_my_wall_of_text/,2016-02-28 10:50:59,"The first sentence is always just as awkward as the title though. Anyways, Ive posted here before, and while Ive talked to some interesting people, things usually fizzle out or we arent looking for the same things. Ive decided rather than going on and on about things I like (which often has a lot of the same things that most redditors enjoy), I should post something more detailed about myself as a person and what I am looking for in another person. I guess this is the part where I talk about myself a lot. Everyone loves doing this, right?! Lets start with the basic and boring stuff. Im a 27 year old male. I have a very, very useful degree in History which serves the purpose of allowing me to indicate Im university educated. I work in cybersecurity, and it's a pretty fun job most of the time. I just recently moved to northern Virginia, so I'm trying to get used to the area. This is the part where I try to talk about myself as a person, and feel slightly (or extremely) douchey while doing so. Although I treat most things seriously and am often very self-conscious, I much prefer lightheartedness and humor whenever possible. Which is all the time, in my opinion. I also type like a robot, which doesnt match my verbal diction in the slightest. I think maybe Ill go all out and present various traits in bullet formats, while cringing and curling my toes in embarrassment while doing so: * Im usually a bit critical of most everything (excluding people) in my life or anything I participate it. It may rub some people the wrong way, but I genuinely am an optimistic and happy person. I think perfection is sort of pointless, and being able to improve upon something you enjoy only makes that experience better. Without being able to identify flaws, you cant really improve anything or enhance enjoyment. * Im an ambitious person. I study 5-10 hours a week to continue to build upon my knowledge and add formal training/certifications to augment my resume and enhance my career opportunities. Im certainly not a workaholic, but I genuinely want to be able to offer any family I may have as much as/more than what my parents offered me as a child or as much as my father offered my mother. * I would like to think Im a nice person to people I care about. Its subjective, and Im damn sure not perfect, but I take it very seriously to be punctual, respectful, loyal, and honest to anyone I value in my life. I will admit that I could probably be nicer to everyone rather than the people important to me. * I will laugh at everything. I dont drama or serious situations all the time; theyre quite draining. I also prefer to directly engage any emotions or issues which may get in the way of being happy. Oh, and fuck passive aggression. Unless its to people in the work place. Thats fair game. * Im an introverted person/INFJ (if that really matters to you). With that said, Im not the type of person to refuse going out with my SO/friends. I enjoy being alone, but its not so bad that being around people will cause an excessive drain on me or make me uncomfortable in any way. Unless its something ridiculous, like going to see Magic Mike. Then I may try to finagle my way out of it. Are you titillated and riveted my numerous super qualifications as a stellar human? Well, as for what Im looking for in a person: * Some form of ambition or drive. You dont have to be rich or powerful, but having the drive to do something well or be extremely passionate about a topic is an attractive quality. * Independent/Strong-willed. Im not going to rely on you for everything in my life, and I dont expect the same in return. Being able to be yourself, while being able to truly enjoy being with someone, is very important. * Intelligence, and to a lesser extent, knowledge. I like being the dumber of the two in a relationships. Im not the smartest man in the world, and I will end up respecting the hell out of you if you make me feel dumb (in a non-masochistic sort of way). * Shared interests are always cool too. I like a lot of things. Id like to like things with you. Lets like things together. * If applicable, someone who isnt terrified of distance (temporarily, anyways). I dont think its normal to enjoy the distance part of an LDR, but if anything progresses beyond friendship, being able to cope with the difficulties that come along with the distance is important. I have pictures too, and Id gladly trade them in messages. Looks arent everything, but to say they dont matter is just untrue in my opinion. If you read this far, you should probably message me. I wouldnt want to read all that crap for no reason."

Currently, I am working to return to school for a Master's degree in IT and Cybersecurity and that is where my mind is. Anyone with the same drive and ambition to want to better themselves and better things in their life will easily have my attention. I'm taking a break from video games for my studies and my other hobbies. Running, archery, hiking, I love to discover new trails in San Antonio. I'm huge on board gaming too. I love to go to the movies! Also love to listen to power metal, it gets me pumped for the day and for a workout. I'm also interested in making hard cider, martial arts, anime, and talking about anything and everything from politics, world events, mathematics, philosophy, theology, movies, and other things, so if you love to talk, I'm a regular chatterbox! I also do some writing, specifically Gothic horror, Lovecraftian horror, that sort of thing. Physically, I'm 5'11"" just a fraction of an inch under six even. I'm 242 pounds, and falling fast! I'm on a pretty hard diet and exercise routine, trying to slim up for summer and health reasons and it's working so far. My weight is a number, I'm neither proud nor ashamed of it (I don't do the big and beautiful thing, but my weight isn't something I shy away from either.) I have a full beard that I keep relatively short, not viking long, but I grow it out a bit occasionally. Dark brown hair, kept short, blue/grey eyes, Caucasian, broadly built. I work at a library at UTSA and I'm looking to get into IT, so tech talk interests me too, especially from a professional in the field! College educated with two BAs, History and English. Aside from the above, what am I looking for? Well, first and foremost, write me up and find out! I'm always interested in talking to geeks (I think adorkable is an awesome word) and gamers. I'm a bit of a grown up child at heart and I'd love someone I can be silly and immature with, while still holding to me goals and ambitions and working towards them. Would love a mentor and tutor for coding, ethical hacking, InfoSec and Cybersecurity, and IT in general. Tall girls, short hair, and tomboys are all a plus. I love anyone that's rough and tumble, not afraid to be immature, and is more of a warrior than a princess. I'm very comfortable with my sexuality, so sex-plus is a big plus. Challenge me physically and intellectually and I will do the same. I really admire strength, will, ambition, and go-getter attitudes! [Here](URL are some photos of me as is the custom here. As an aside, I've been considering exploring open and poly relationships, but I'm not sure on these. However, I'm not afraid to try even if it doesn't work out."
