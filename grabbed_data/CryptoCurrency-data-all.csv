At least I could see on Ledger and Bitcoin subs, that people think, they are safe if they do not download some malware on their pc/laptop. But this is wrong. The issue can be exploited also when you use only standard applications on your Ledger which are affected (BTC and its derivates) The attack vector here is, if some tricks you to interface with the malicious **web wallet** with your Ledger. (so no you do not need to install anything to lose your coins) As an example: 1. the attacker sends you a link for LTC web wallet (he says it is a new really great wallet and want you to try or whatever other reason) 2. you think you are safe, after all, Ledger protects your private keys and everything has to be confirmed. So you connect and will try to send out some LTC to the attacker just as a donation or anything else. 3. The web wallet sends spoofed transaction to your Ledger, so you think you are confirming LTC transfer, instead your BTC is sent out There are many scenarios like this. You are affected anytime you interact with your Ledger and any web service. (not only if you use fake sw wallets) I explicitly asked about it and this attack vector was [confirmed](URL by Ledger.

It runs through all the basics and discusses some of the pros, cons and risks. &amp;#x200B; ![img](4dfxf2fvfjx41) **Overview** Qtum (pronounced quantum) is a Singapore-based open-source, public blockchain platform launched in 2017 that leverages the security and simplicity of Bitcoins UTXO protocol with the composability and flexibility of Ethereum smart contracts. Qtum integrates an Ethereum-esque Virtual Machine (VM) with open-source Bitcoin Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) code through a proprietary layer known as Account Abstraction Layer (AAL). **QTUM Strengths** * Compatibility with Bitcoin and Ethereum code allowing Qtum to leverage other projects innovation and work. * Active project development dating back to 2015. * One of the first-to-market Proof of Stake v3 projects with competitive staking ROI (\~4.5%). * High node count compared to other altcoins. **QTUM Weaknesses** * Qtum faces immense competitor risk, little user/dApp adoption, and potential project apathy illustrated by low staking participation (\~20%). * Poor token distribution to the masses (51% of supply) and heavy token allocation to team, foundation, and development (49%) resulting in extreme wealth concentration among the top 10 addresses. * Co-founder Patrick Dai denied his involvement with another controversial cryptocurrency project (before being confronted with overwhelming evidence to the contrary) where he used an alias and allegedly profited in bitcoin. * PoS security remains less mature and understood than PoW. Qtum suffered one PoS vulnerability (fake stake attack) already in January 2019 which has since been fixed."

If you can get past our active security, you win it.",1,glzxwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/glzxwt/blockd_has_put_3_ether_in_the_most_vulnerable/,2020-05-18 21:46:25,"Blockd is back again risking another 3 Ether to demonstrate the power of our new product, Blockd Build. &amp;#x200B; Blockd Build provides custom smart contract security that actively monitors for and intervenes in pending hacks. It traces pending transactions to determine their effect, then blocks the transaction or pauses the contract if malicious actions are going to take place, such as the owner variable being changed by a non-owner, the contract losing more Ether than the senders balance, or the Oraclize callback not matching the called API. &amp;#x200B; For this demonstration, weve created a very vulnerable Ethereum contract. Anybody is able to change the owner of the contract, users are able to withdraw as much Ether as they want, and the Oraclize callback function can be called by anyone. Blockd Build, however, will stop any hacks from occurring despite the contract having these unknown vulnerabilities. &amp;#x200B; The specific vectors this security protects represent the DAO hack, the first Parity hack, the recent DeFi hacks, and more that could have been stopped without ever knowing there was a vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; To hack the contract, go to Etherscan (or anywhere else you can interact with the blockchain) and use MetaMask from the write contract tab to call whatever function youd like to take advantage of. If you are acting within the allowance of the smart contract (such as only withdrawing as much as you have deposited), Blockd will let your transaction through. If not, Blockd will race your transaction to blacklist you before your transaction is executed. &amp;#x200B; The Etherscan link is: URL &amp;#x200B; For information on how the system works on Ethereum and any other similar blockchain, you can visit blockd.co or read this Medium article that provides more detail: URL &amp;#x200B; Were currently creating active security systems for a decentralized exchange and a smart wallet system, and if youd like to get your smart contracts protected, contact us at [contact@blockd.co](mailto:contact@blockd.co) or through our website at blockd.co. &amp;#x200B; P.S. 1. If youre trying to beat Blockds transactions through racing, be careful! Its much cheaper for us to blacklist you than it is for you to execute a hack so, if you lose, you could end up spending a lot of Ether in gas! 2. If youre testing a normal deposit/withdrawal, please use just a few wei. We dont want anyones Ether getting locked in the contract after theyre blacklisted. 3. Using a blacklist is for a public example so that many people can test the security. On real contracts, an immediate pause that stops all hack attempts and gives developers time to address the problem is a more likely blocker alternative. 4. Well be withdrawing the Ether and shutting down the security after a day or so or if we start running low on gas funds needed to block the hacks."

When the exchange or wallet does not verify the valid field in the transaction when detecting the crediting of USDT to the account, USDT false top-up vulnerability will occur. Recently, according to the intelligence from SlowMist Zone, some hackers have adopted the new USDT false top-up method. Hackers have issued other types of tokens on Omni to fake the USDT to carry out the USDT false top-up attack on the exchange or wallet. If the propertyid in the transaction is not verified when the exchange or wallet is detecting USDT top-up, a false top-up situation will occur. The SlowMist security team has verified that some exchanges have suffered losses due to this problem. Due to the widespread use of USDT in the Omni protocol, most people believe that there is only USDT in the Omni protocol, which leads to ignoring other types of unknown currencies in the Omni protocol, which can easily cause false top-up issues. The SlowMist security team recommends that the exchange or wallet self-check the USDT credit-to-account logic and contact the SlowMist security team for verification if necessary."

7,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Why I switched to crypto after I traded 10 years with forex,1,f0bqbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f0bqbo/why_i_switched_to_crypto_after_i_traded_10_years/,2020-02-08 02:10:13,"I recently noticed that the Forex trading market is insanely regulated which means that the middlemen are present everywhere in this world, therefore, I decided to make my analysis about the so-called wonderful world of Forex trading. Starting with unresponsive brokers and ending with smartly hidden fees and costs, the Forex trading process can become very expensive very fast and this can happen even before a trader can turn a dollar into profit. This means that traders need to have a considerable amount of capital before they can begin trade. I also believe that institutional involvement is another significant aspect of Forex trading, unlike crypto, Forex traders are competing with established banks, high-frequency traders, and other specialized companies. In a nutshell, I have found that this institutional involvement makes it very challenging to compete. Here are some very interesting and productive facts as to why cryptocurrency trading is better than forex trading: **1) Your safety, your money** Unlike the Forex market where there are many suffocating regulations, as well as many cases of identity theft, crypto traders that use digital currency are in direct control of their transactions which makes everything much safer. Another important thing here that Ive noticed here is that the transactions are made free from the identities of the parties involved. This grants a considerable amount of help in protecting users from all forms of identity theft. **2) There is no inflation** Every traditional currency experiences different inflation fluctuations because of the ongoing movement of global economies which shifts prices continuously. In response to this, countries print more money, therefore, increasing capital inflation. Cryptocurrency does not experience this issue. Thats why it is more predictable. **3) Cryptocurrency trading is a clear process** Unlike forex trading crypto trading uses a recorder which is called a blockchain, it is here where all transactions are recorded and monitored. In other words, when a transaction is completed it is automatically transcribed on the ledger. These transactions can be verified by anyone anytime. No person or organization can modify this ledger this is why this is considered to be the biggest security feature. **4) Fast and solid transactions.** Probably the best advantage, when compared to the forex market, is that the crypto market is free from any type of central banking regulations and control as well as other third-party vendors, thats why transaction fees are extremely low. **5) Availability** The crypto investment funds bring many opportunities between parties anywhere in the world. These enable individuals to use and trade cryptocurrency even if they are from harsh countries without solid banking institutions. **What are crypto funds and why they are beating forex?** In the complex world of cryptocurrency trading, a user is required to have plenty of crypto assets. Those who are new to this practice are already mining an abundant quantity of cryptocurrency, without the help of an investment fund this can be rather difficult due to the growing complexities of the prospecting process. So I ask myself how can novices build up their assets? This is when a crypto fund comes into the picture! Ive discussed with [trading specialists](URL who specialize in creating crypto funds to give you all the characteristics of what the crypto funds are as well as the new outcomes in this field. A crypto fund is the regulated asset of a digital currency that is accessible to the investors for replication, it also works as a connection between a trader, who is producing the crypto fund, and the one who would gladly invest in that supply. The concluding goal of engaging in a crypto fund is to augment crypto assets for both the winning participants. In the year 2020, the crypto funds have evolved as the digital translation of fiat currency. Because this is an independent form of currency, it enables anyone to inaugurate a fund solely by adding a new cryptocurrency. As a consequence, several types of crypto funds have developed aiming to gratify the desire of investors and traders so that they can ultimately increase their digital assets. Many currencies are regulated by their governments making them sensitive to financial and pecuniary procedures as well as other geopolitical developments. On the other hand, cryptocurrencies are managed instantly by clever algorithms and are only influenced by the actions of those using them. This makes the crypto market more engaging for investors who do not want vulnerability to inflation or state administration policy arrangements. **Why did I invest in crypto funds instead of trading or mining** Here are the major advantages that you may experience after you invest in a crypto fund: * The leading advantage of financing in a crypto fund is that the cryptocurrency is going to be the money of the tomorrow. Therefore, financing in such crypto funds will aid you to earn a solid future. * Most of crypto funds are open, sharing their asset structure with weekly reports * People can invest in crypto funds from anywhere in the world * Cryptocurrency mining has now grown more complex than it was in the past. Because of this, the rate of crypto mining is reduced due to the notable turnover of people towards cryptocurrency and the developments introduced in the mining algorithms. It became harder to track new movements in the market * Investing in crypto funds fits a reliable method to develop your assets. * Crypto funds offer greater profit margins. * The volatility of assets is limited. * As a crypto fund manager You can fundraise investments directly to your wallet without any type of fees * Absolutely anyone can invest in your trading strategies even if they are a million miles away. * You are not required to be legally registered (but if you want people to trust you - you have to be legally registered) Ending Ideas In conclusion I feel confident that Forex is now becoming a trading process of the past and it will continue to remain affixed in the 2000s but now in the year 2020 the future resides in the crypto investment fund because it is a highly suitable method to earn money without getting stuck in any difficult mining algorithms.

8,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Attempt at an unbiased summary of the IOTA attack by a non-bag holder,1,f5bw6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f5bw6c/attempt_at_an_unbiased_summary_of_the_iota_attack/,2020-02-18 04:10:58,"On February 12th the IOTA Foundation (IF) posted a status update: &gt;**February 12th 2020 - 08:55** &gt; &gt;After receiving several reports of fund theft that looked out of the ordinary in a short timeframe we decided to warn about this in Discord and on Twitter. As a precaution we ask you to keep your Trinity wallet closed for now. 25 minutes later they decide to shut down the ""coordinator"", blocking all ""value"" transactions. &gt;**February 12th 2020 - 09:20** &gt; &gt;After initial investigation we decided to turn off the Coordinator to make sure no further theft can occur until we find out the root cause of these thefts. Further investigation taking place from here on. They then spend 5 days investigating the theft. After about 24 hours, only about 10 people reported that they had been stolen from. &gt;**February 13th 2020 - 07:45** &gt; &gt;We've shifted the complete focus of all relevant resources of the IOTA Foundation to this investigation last night and we have been working in teams to investigate impact and cause together with the identified victims. The conclusions so far are: \- Most evidence is pointing towards seed theft, cause still unknown and under investigation \- Victims (around 10 that identified with the IOTA Foundation so far) all seem to have recently used Trinity However, it seems by examining at the transactions that they knew were associated with the theft and were able to identify some new thefts. &gt;**February 14th 2020 - 05:45** &gt; &gt;... &gt; &gt; The investigation has yielded absolutely no indication that there has been a core protocol breach of any kind. Rather, **all evidence so far points to a problem with a dependency of the Trinity wallet.** &gt; &gt;The attack pattern analysis showed that the halt of the coordinator interrupted the attacker's attempts to liquidate funds on exchanges. The stolen funds have been purposely and repeatedly merged and split to obfuscate the investigation, and with the **current token exchange rate as well as exchanges' KYC limits in mind.** We received additional feedback from more exchanges (not all yet), confirming that none of the identified transactions has been received or liquidated. Our current assumption is that the perpetrator targeted high value accounts first, before moving on to smaller accounts and then being interrupted early by the halt of the coordinator. (Again: Hardware wallet users are not affected.) To me, the details sound like the perpetrator was experienced and knew how to convert the tokens to a less-centralized cryptocurency without KYC/AML. It wasn't simply a crime of opportunity, but rather there was some planning. There was a lot of speculation over whether or not the hacker was ""sophisticated"". Of course, he did manage to pwn IOTA's official wallet. However, the ""Chairman of the Board"" of IOTA wrote ""**Let's just say theres a lot of traces. The attacker does not seem to have been too sophisticated"",** on discord. [link](URL On **February 16th,** IF released a new version of their wallet. &gt; **- Update: Remove exchange support (#2565)** &gt; &gt; **- Update: Adjust update alerts and disable auto update (#2566)** &gt; &gt; \- Fix: Allow wallet entry when nodes are not in sync (#2563) &gt; &gt; \- Update: New Crowdin translations (#2553) - Fix: Endless loading cycle (#2568) Two interesting changes are they removed exchange support and they disabled auto updates. IF had recently integrated ""Moonpay""in their wallet, which allows users to buy [IOTA with their credit cards](URL for a 4.5% fee. Moonpay appears to be affiliated with Roger Ver and [Bitcoin.com](URL but I didn't look into this too much. Purely speculation, but it seems that Moonpay may be involved in the key theft. Fast forward to today, IF released their remediation plan. **Basically, if you used their official wallet since December 17th, 2019 then your seed might be compromised**. However, they say that the attack didn't really start until January 25th, so the Dec 17th date is out of an abundance of caution. Here's the IF remediation plan from [status.iota.org](URL &gt;**February 17th 2020 - 05:47** &gt; &gt;Here is a short overview of the attack remediation plan and the next steps going forward. Essentially the remediation plan involves three steps: STEP 1: INSTALL UPDATED VERSION OF TRINITY As announced yesterday, we have released an updated version of Trinity which allows you to check your balance and transactions. Please download this newest version of Trinity here and install it over your old version: URL When you download the new version, MAKE SURE TO CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD AND STORE IT IN A PASSWORD MANAGER. If you have used the same password also for other services or websites, we strongly recommend you change it there, too, as a precaution. By upgrading to this new version of Trinity, you will remove the vulnerability from your wallet and render the hacker incapable of accessing your wallet if s/he has not already done so. STEP 2: MIGRATE YOUR TOKENS TO SAFE SEEDS In the upcoming days, we will release a seed migration tool that will allow users to transfer their tokens to a safe seed. We strongly recommend that ALL users who have opened any version of Trinity (Desktop or Mobile) since the 17th of December 2019 utilize the tool and migrate their tokens to a new, safe seed during the soon-to-be-announced migration period BEFORE the coordinator is re-started. More information on the tool and how to use it will be provided when the tool is published. By migrating your tokens to new, safe seeds prior to the re-start of the coordinator, you will render the attacker incapable of making unauthorized transfers of your tokens if s/he has not already done so. \*Note: our current information indicates that **the hack started on or around 25 January 2020** and that only Trinity Desktop users seeds were potentially compromised. However, out of an abundance of caution, we are nevertheless recommending that ALL users (not only desktop users) who are concerned about possible token loss should migrate their tokens to a new seed. \*Note: Ledger Nano users do not need to use the migration tool but a password change is still strongly recommended. STEP 3: RECLAIM YOUR STOLEN TOKENS IF NECESSARY Our current information indicates that only a limited number of bundles were successfully transferred by the attacker out of the true owners wallets. We have notified all exchanges of all compromised bundles we are aware of so as to prevent any further movement of any stolen tokens. We therefore anticipate that in the majority of cases, Steps 1 and 2 will be sufficient to protect most users tokens. To address the minority of cases in which unauthorized token transfers were made out of users wallets, a third step is needed. **We will perform a global snapshot of the network that will, pending community validation, enable us to bring stolen tokens back to the affected users.** More information on the process as well as the consequences for all affected users will be provided soon. Assuming the snapshot is successfully validated by the IOTA community (node operators), we will **implement a KYC procedure involving a third party that will enable all users who had their tokens stolen to reclaim them.** The same procedure will also be required for certain cases in which the migration tool is used fraudulently or incorrectly. More information on this process will follow shortly. After the migration process, we will restart the coordinator and resume normal operations on the network. An update on the timeline will be released in the upcoming days. We will publish detailed instructions on the steps users should take as soon as the remediation tools and processes are ready. For now, please make sure to download the new Trinity version to change your password and check your balance. We would also like to ask any **affected users from the United States** to come forward and DM our team, as your cooperation could assist us with ongoing law enforcement investigations. Thank you all for your patience. We will continue to update you on all important steps along the way and will do our best to make the transition as easy and smooth as possible. So yea, **if you got your tokens stolen, they will return them to you after you submit KYC/AML to the IOTA Foundation, assuming that ""node operators"" agree to roll back the theft.** Hopefully users didn't reuse the same seed for another cryptocurrency because they won't be able to roll those back. It sounds like they're working with the FBI (or US law enforcement) on this which is a bit surprising. I'm skeptical that they have really identified the perpetrator -- a common attack is to steal developer Github credentials which could be what happened here. But again, that's purely speculation. Please don't repost this on your for-profit crypto news site without attributing to me ;)"
9,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,IOTA Trinity wallet hack - status update,1,f6akgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/f6akgu/iota_trinity_wallet_hack_status_update/,2020-02-20 00:28:40,"A short update about the current situation. 1. As a reminder, ALL TRINITY USERS WHO OPENED TRINITY BETWEEN 17 DECEMBER 2019 AND 18 FEBRUARY 2020 WILL NEED TO USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR TOKENS. We are still working on building and testing the seed migration tool. We will inform you here as soon as it is ready. 2. Last night we released an updated mobile wallet for both iOS and Android. Please visit the App Store or Play Store respectively to download it or update your current version. While, as of now, we have no indication that mobile users were affected by the attack, out of an abundance of caution, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT EVEN MOBILE WALLET USERS CHANGE THEIR PASSWORD AND USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL AS SOON AS ITS AVAILABLE. 3. Trinity users who have already updated their wallets will have noticed the removal of MoonPay services from the updated versions of the wallet. This was necessary because the security vulnerability was introduced into the Trinity wallet via the MoonPay integration. We are working on an incident report in which we will publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability, how it was introduced, how it was exploited, and the steps we are taking to improve our security practices as a whole. 4. We have received requests from several users to provide information as to whether any Trinity users credit card information might have been compromised in connection with this security incident. Moonpay provides payment processing as a function of its own platform, which is independent of Trinity. For now, we can only share with the community the below statement from Moonpay on this matter. Please note that the IOTA Foundation is not in a position to independently verify the accuracy of the statement, due to the fact that the evidence to support it is not in our possession. MoonPay Statement to Customers on Credit Card Information MoonPay, as a partner of Trinity Wallet, has been working with the IOTA Foundation and third-party experts to assist with the ongoing investigation. At this time, as the payment processor of the Trinity Wallet, we want to inform users who have input their credit card details into the Trinity Wallet that, to the best of our knowledge, their credit card information is unlikely to have been compromised by this security incident. Credit card details are encrypted and processed in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, until the investigation has been completed, we would like to ask users who purchased Miota using the Trinity Wallet to monitor their statements and report any suspicious activity they observe to their banks immediately. 5. We are constantly in contact with law enforcement in several countries and are working closely with them to ensure fast and thorough investigations. If youre an affected user, we would greatly appreciate it if you could please file a report with your local police, as this will help us with the criminal investigations. In most countries you can quickly file a report online. We recommend that you include in your report the following German case file number so that the authorities in your country can quickly get in touch with the other authorities already working on the investigation elsewhere: Germany, Center for Cybercrime, Case Number: 200213-1717-i00290 6. We are still refining the remediation plan in light of continuously updated information and will provide further details as soon as we can. Thank you all for your patience. We will continue to update you on all important developments as we are able."

They claimed that **~90% of Australia's crypto retail revenue is processed via their own HULA system** and that **~92% of all crypto retail revenue happens in BCH**. They are aggregating two data sources to come up with this claim. One is **TravelByBit (TBB)** who *publishes* their PoS transactions (BTC, LN, ETH, BNB, DASH, BCH) live on a [ticker](URL The other source is **HULA**, a newly introduced POS system (BCH only) and direct competitor to TBB run by BitcoinBCH.com - the same company who created the report. Despite being on-chain their transactions are *private*, not published and not verifiable by third parties outside BitcoinBCH.com Two things stood out in the ""reports"", noted by multiple users (including vocal BCH proponents): - **The non-BCH parts must have tx excluded and the report neglects to mention it** (the total in their TBB analysis does not match what is reported on the TBB website.) - **The BCH part has outliers included** (e.g. BCH city conference in September with 35x the daily average) The TBB website loads the historic tx data in the browser but hides transactions older than 7 days from being displayed, i.e. you can access more than 7 days worth of data if you understand JavaScript and can read the source code ([source](URL ## Hayden Otto's reaction In direct response to me publishing these findings on r/btc, Hayden Otto - an employee at BitcoinBCH.com and the author of the report who also happens to be a moderator of /r/BitcoinCash - banned me immediately from said sub ([source](URL In subsequent discussion (which repeated for every monthly ""report"" which was flawed in the same ways as described above), Hayden responded using the same tactics: *** **""No data was removed""** &gt; ""The guy is straight out lying. There is guaranteed no missing tx as the data was collected directly from the source."" ([source](URL **** **""Only data I considered non-retail was removed""** &gt; ""I also had these data points and went through them to remove non-retail transactions, on both TravelbyBit and HULA."" ([source](URL He admits to have removed non-BCH tx by ""Game Ranger"" because he considers them non-retail ([source](URL He also implies they might be involved in money laundering and that TBB might fail their AML obligations in processing Game Ranger's transactions ([source](URL The report does not mention any data being excluded at all and he still fails to explain why several businesses that are clearly retail (e.g. restaurants, cafes, markets) had tx excluded ([source](URL **** **""You are too late to prove I altered the data""** &gt; ""[...] I recorded [the data] manually from URL over the month of September. The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](URL Fortunately you can, if you can read the website's source code. But you need to know a bit of JavaScript to verify it yourself, so not an ideal method to easily prove the claim of data exclusion to the public. But it laters turns out Hayden himself has found an easier way to achieve the same. *** **""The report can't be wrong because it has been audited.""** In response to criticism about the flawed methodology in generating the September report, BitcoinBCH.com hired an accountant from a regional Bitcoin BCH startup to ""audit"" the October report. This is remarkable, because not only did their reported TBB totals still not match those from the TBB site - their result was mathematically impossible. How so? No subset of TBB transaction in that month sums up to the total they reported. So even if they excluded retail transactions at will, they still must have messed up the sum ([source](URL Why didn't their auditor notice their mistake? She said she ""conducted a review based on the TravelByBit data **provided to her**"", i.e. the data acquisition and selection process was **explicitly excluded from the audit** ([source](URL *** **""You are a 'pathetic liar', a 'desperate toll', an 'astroturf account' and 'a total dumb ass' and are 'pulling numbers out of your ass!'""** Since he has already banned me from the sub he moderates, he started to resort to ad hominems ([source](URL [source](URL [source](URL [source](URL ## Proof of exclusion I published raw data as extracted from the TBB site after each report for comparison. Hayden responded that I made those numbers up and that I [was pulling numbers out of my ass](URL Since he was under the impression that &gt; ""The website only shows transactions from the last 7 days **and then they disappear. No way for anyone to access stats beyond that.**"" ([source](URL he felt confident to claim that I would be &gt; unable to provide a source for the [missing] data and/or **prove that that data was not already included in the report**. ([source](URL Luckily for us Hayden Otto seems to dislike his competitor TravelByBit so much that he attempted to reframe Bitcoin's RBF feature as a vulnerability specific to TBB PoS system ([source](URL While doublespending a merchant using the TBB PoS he wanted to prove that the merchant successfully registered the purchase as complete and thus exposed that **the PoS sales history of TBB's merchants are available to the public** ([source](URL in his own words: &gt; ""You can literally access it from a public URL in the Web browser. There is no login or anything required, just type in the name of the merchant."" ([source](URL As of yet it is unclear if this is intentional by TBB or if Hayden Ottos followed the rules of responsible disclosure before publishing this kind of data leak. As it happens, those sale histories do not only include the merchant and time of purchases, they **even include the address the funds were sent to (in case of on-chain payments)**. This gives us an easy method to prove that the purchases from the TBB website missing in the reports belong to a specific retail business and actually happened - something that is impossible to prove for the alleged HULA txs. In order to make it easier for you to verify it yourself, we'll focus on a single day in the dataset, **September 17th, 2019** as an example: - Hayden Otto's report claims **20 tx and $713.00** in total for that day ([source](URL - The TBB website listed **40 tx and a total of $1032.90** ([daily summary](URL - Pick a merchant, e.g. ""The Stand Desserts"" - Use Hayden's ""trick"" to access that merchants public sale history at URL sort by date to find the 17th Sep 2019 and look for a transaction at 20:58 for $28. This proves that a purchase of said amount is associated with this specific retail business. - Paste the associated crypto on-chain address `17MrHiRcKzCyuKPtvtn7iZhAZxydX8raU9` in a blockchain explorer of your choice, e.g like [this](URL This proves that a transfer of funds has actually happened. I let software aggregate the TBB statistics with the public sale histories and you'll find at the bottom of this post a table with the on-chain addresses conveniently linked to blockchain explorers for our example date. The total of **all 40 tx is $1032.90** instead of the $713.00 reported by Hayden. 17 tx of those have a corresponding on-chain address and thus have undeniable proof of $758.10. Of the remaining 23, 22 are on Lightning and one had no merchant history available. This is just for a single day, here is a comparison for the whole month. | Description | Total | | - | - | | TBB Total | $10,502| | TBB wo. Game Ranger|$5,407| | TBB according to Hayden|$3,737| ## What now? The usual shills will respond in a predictive manner: The data must be fake even though its proof is on-chain, I would need to provide more data but HULA can be trusted without any proof, if you include outliers BCH comes out ahead, yada, yada. But this is not important. I am not here to convince them and this post doesn't aim to. The tx numbers we are talking about are less than 0.005% of Bitcoin's global volume. If you can increase adoption in your area by 100% by just buying 2 coffees more per day you get a rough idea about how irrelevant the numbers are in comparison. What is relevant though and what this post aims to highlight is that BitcoinBCH.com and the media outlets around news.bitcoin.com flooding you with the BCH #1 narrative are playing dirty. They feel justified because they feel that Bitcoin/Core/Blockstream is playing dirty as well. I am not here to judge that but you as a reader of this sub should be aware that this is happening and that you are the target. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes $1,000 Bitcoin tx because of high value but includes $15,000 BCH tx because they are made by ""professionals"", you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes game developers, travel businesses or craftsmen accepting Bitcoin because they don't have a physical store but include a lawyer practice accepting BCH, you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com excludes restaurants, bars and supermarkets accepting Bitcoin and when pressed reiterate that they excluded **non-retail** businesses without ever explaning why a restaurant shouldn't be considered reatil, you should be sceptical. When BitcoinBCH.com claims the reports have been audited but omit that the data acquisition was not part of the audit, you should be sceptical. I expect that BitcoinBCH.com will stop removing transactions from TBB for their reports now that it has been shown that their exclusion can be provably uncovered. I also expect that HULA's BCH numbers will rise accordingly to maintain a similar difference. Hayden Otto assumed that nobody could cross-check the TBB data. He was wrong. Nobody will be able to disprove his claims when HULA's BCH numbers rise as he continues to refuse their release. You should treat his claims accordingly. As usual, do your own research and draw your own conclusion. Sorry for the long read. ## TLDR - BitcoinBCH.com claimed no transactions were removed from the TBB dataset in their BCH #1 reports and that is impossible to prove the opposite. - Hayden Otto's reveals in a double spend attempt that a TBB merchant's sale history can be accessed publicly including the merchant's on-chain addresses. - This table shows 40 tx listed on the TBB site on sep 17th, including their on-chain addresses where applicable. - The BitcoinBCH.com report lists only 20 tx for the same day. | No. | Date | Merchant | Asset | Address | Amount | Total | | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | | 1 | 17 Sep 19 09:28 | LTD Espresso | Lightning | Unable to find merchant history. | 4.50 | 4.50 | | 2 | 17 Sep 19 09:40 | LTD Espresso | Binance Coin | Unable to find merchant history. | 4.50 | 9.00 | | 3 | 17 Sep 19 13:22 | [Josh's IGA Murray Bridge West](URL | Ether | [0x40fd53aa...b6de43c531](URL | 4.60 | 13.60 | | 4 | 17 Sep 19 13:23 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Lightning | lnbc107727...zkcqvvgklf | 16.00 | 29.60 | | 5 | 17 Sep 19 13:24 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Lightning | lnbc100994...mkspwddgqw | 15.00 | 44.60 | | 6 | 17 Sep 19 14:02 | [Nom Nom Korean Eatery](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1w5mwu9...552thl4ru5](URL | 30.00 | 74.60 | | 7 | 17 Sep 19 15:19 | [Dollars and Sense (Fortitude Valley)](URL | Lightning | lnbc134780...93cpanyxfg | 2.00 | 76.60 | | 8 | 17 Sep 19 15:34 | [Steph's Cafe](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb124hcjy...ss3pz9y3r8](URL | 57.50 | 134.10 | | 9 | 17 Sep 19 19:37 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb13f58s9...qqc7fxln7s](URL | 18.00 | 152.10 | | 10 | 17 Sep 19 19:59 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575880...48cpl0z06q | 8.50 | 160.60 | | 11 | 17 Sep 19 20:00 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575770...t8spzjflym | 8.50 | 169.10 | | 12 | 17 Sep 19 20:13 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc202980...lgqp5ha8f4 | 3.00 | 172.10 | | 13 | 17 Sep 19 20:21 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc577010...decq7r4p05 | 8.50 | 180.60 | | 14 | 17 Sep 19 20:24 | [Fat Dumpling](URL | Lightning | lnbc217145...9dsqpjjr6g | 32.10 | 212.70 | | 15 | 17 Sep 19 20:31 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc574530...wvcpp3pcen | 8.50 | 221.20 | | 16 | 17 Sep 19 20:33 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc540660...rpqpzgk8z0 | 8.00 | 229.20 | | 17 | 17 Sep 19 20:37 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc128468...r8cqq50p5c | 19.00 | 248.20 | | 18 | 17 Sep 19 20:39 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc135220...cngp2zq6q4 | 2.00 | 250.20 | | 19 | 17 Sep 19 20:45 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc574570...atcqg738p8 | 8.50 | 258.70 | | 20 | 17 Sep 19 20:51 | [Fat Dumpling](URL | Lightning | lnbc414190...8hcpg79h9a | 61.20 | 319.90 | | 21 | 17 Sep 19 20:53 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc135350...krqqp3cz8z | 2.00 | 321.90 | | 22 | 17 Sep 19 20:58 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Bitcoin | [17MrHiRcKz...ZxydX8raU9](URL | 28.00 | 349.90 | | 23 | 17 Sep 19 21:02 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Bitcoin | [1Hwy8hCBff...iEh5fBsCWK](URL | 10.00 | 359.90 | | 24 | 17 Sep 19 21:03 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc743810...dvqqnuunjq | 11.00 | 370.90 | | 25 | 17 Sep 19 21:04 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc114952...2vqpclm87p | 17.00 | 387.90 | | 26 | 17 Sep 19 21:10 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc169160...lpqqqt574c | 2.50 | 390.40 | | 27 | 17 Sep 19 21:11 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc575150...40qq9yuqmy | 8.50 | 398.90 | | 28 | 17 Sep 19 21:13 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc947370...qjcp3unr33 | 14.00 | 412.90 | | 29 | 17 Sep 19 21:15 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1tc2vva...xppes5t7d0](URL | 16.00 | 428.90 | | 30 | 17 Sep 19 21:16 | [Giardinetto](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb1auyep2...w64p6a6dlk](URL | 350.00 | 778.90 | | 31 | 17 Sep 19 21:25 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3H2iJaKNXH...5sxPk3t2tV](URL | 7.00 | 785.90 | | 32 | 17 Sep 19 21:39 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb17r7x3e...avaxwumc58](URL | 8.00 | 793.90 | | 33 | 17 Sep 19 21:47 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [32kuPYT1tc...uFQwgsA5ku](URL | 18.00 | 811.90 | | 34 | 17 Sep 19 21:52 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3ELPvxtCSy...4QzvfVJsNZ](URL | 36.00 | 847.90 | | 35 | 17 Sep 19 21:56 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Lightning | lnbc677740...acsp04sjeg | 10.00 | 857.90 | | 36 | 17 Sep 19 22:04 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [38b4wHg9cg...9L2WXC2BSK](URL | 54.00 | 911.90 | | 37 | 17 Sep 19 22:16 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb14lylhs...x6wz7kjzp5](URL | 18.00 | 929.90 | | 38 | 17 Sep 19 22:21 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3L8SK3Hr7u...F3htdSPxfL](URL | 90.00 | 1019.90 | | 39 | 17 Sep 19 22:30 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | Binance Coin | [bnb19w6tle...774uknv57t](URL | 5.00 | 1024.90 | | 40 | 17 Sep 19 22:48 | [The Stand Desserts](URL | BCH | [3Qag8c4UYg...9EYuWzGjhs](URL | 8.00 | 1032.90 |"
14,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Mobile wallets and security,4,df3mdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/df3mdy/mobile_wallets_and_security/,2019-10-09 04:57:27,"So in the light of Coinbase Pro's recent fee hike, and because ""not your keys, not your crypto"", I'm planning to pull my coins (mostly Bitcoin/Ether and some DAI) out of their custody and into a proper non-custodial wallet. In preparation for that, I've recently downloaded a bunch of popular iOS wallet apps to take them for a test drive so I can make an informed decision. My criteria for a wallet are as follows: * Multi-coin support (at least Bitcoin + Ether + ERC20) * Strong security (key never leaves device, ideally stored in the iPhone's [secure enclave](URL * Ease of use * (Bonus) built-in dapp browser Wallets I've considered so far: * [Coinbase Wallet](URL * [Ethos Wallet](URL (no dapp support) * [Exodus Wallet](URL (no dapp support) * [Trust Wallet](URL * [Argent](URL (Ethereum only, no multi-coin support except for ERC20 tokens) One thing I've noticed, and which strikes me as a bit odd, is that all of these wallets are free, and all of them quite professionally done. I literally could not find any wallet that costs money, which obviously raises the question ""how are they paying their developers?""  As we all know from companies like Facebook and Google, if the product is free, then YOU'RE the product being sold. Sadly, none of these apps even address this seemingly obvious concern on their websites. At least [Ethos takes the time to explain their wallet's security measures](URL however, just like with the other apps, you'll have to take them by their word when they say that your key never leaves your device. Now, Coinbase Wallet and Trust Wallet are owned by major exchanges (Binance ownes the latter), so they are likely financed by revenues made from trading fees, and provided for free as a customer service. Trust has integrated support for [Binance DEX](URL which would potentially create another stream of revenue for them, while Coinbase likely just want to offer a non-custodial solution for customers who are concerned about security. The other wallets include fiat gateways, so I am assuming that this will pay for the development of their apps. I do wish, however, that companies would take a more proactive approach and answer the obvious question ""why should I trust YOU with my coins?"" After all, you are putting yourself at risk to potentially lose a significant amount of money in case they mess up, and [it wouldn't even be the first time](URL Has anyone here used a software wallet to store a significant amount of coins (&gt; $10k)? If so, which one, and why? Or should I just invest in a hardware wallet at this point? My gripes with the latter (I've test driven a Ledger Nano X before) are that ... 1. Yet another device to keep track of (and potentially lose) 2. UX is quite cumbersome (it's awfully annoying to enter a 4-8 digit PIN code using only two buttons) 3. No biometric authentication (I'm sure that's bound to come at some point in the future) Looking forward to hear your thoughts on this."

19,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Cosmos Hub ATOM Token and the commonly misunderstood staking token - Yield does not equal Profit,2,cfihfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cfihfr/cosmos_hub_atom_token_and_the_commonly/,2019-07-20 15:55:25," This is part three where we look at the ATOM token and general misconceptions around staking tokens. Part one can be found [here](URL and part Two can be found [here](URL # The ATOM token I often see a lot of confusion around what the ATOM token is used for, so let me clarify: * The ATOM token is **NOT** used for all staking / transactions across the entire Cosmos Ecosystem. **It is specific to only the Cosmos Hub**. The Cosmos hub is one of many hubs / zones within the Cosmos Ecosystem. There are other hubs live today such as IRIS (which has its own token IRIS) and Sentinel due to launch later this month (which has its own token SENT). Each Zone will also have its own token to incentivise validators to secure their zone. * Transactions fees paid for the Cosmos Hub **Do Not** have to be paid using ATOM, a wide selection of different tokens will be able to be used to pay transaction fees such as BTC, ETH etc. **The incentive for staking is that you will receive a proportion of these fees in the various currencies depending on the number of ATOMs staked.** * It is **NOT** a currency, nor your normal token that you invest in and just HODL on your ledger. **It is a staking token used to secure the Cosmos Hub**. **ATOM is hyper inflationary** (which rewards those that stake the token to provide security to the Cosmos Hub and punishes those that dont stake via decrease in value per ATOM via inflation. * The Top 100 Validators which stake the most atoms are selected for validating / creating new transactions ATOMs are like ASICs, just as ASICs are a piece of capital you need in order to mine POW chains like Bitcoin, ATOMs are a piece of capital that you need in order to stake on the cosmos hub and earn transaction fees going through that hub. If a lot of ASICs are already in use it is very difficult to attack the network and similarly if a lot of ATOMs are staked, then it is very difficult for someone to buy a large portion of the ATOMs to attack the network. You can read the document explaining the token by the team [here](URL as well as the video below (time stamped from 44:30) as well as [here](URL &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; # Staking Tokens Staking tokens are very commonly misunderstood by people, they assume its a passive income where they can earn 1020% for doing nothing but staking their tokens. Rewards are created by minting new tokens via Inflation, this depreciates the asset of each token by increasing total supply of the tokens. To counter the negative effect of inflation, you can stake your tokens to earn a reward which is greater than the inflation increases. If there was 20% inflation and 100% of the tokens were staked, then there would be no rewards. Its would just be like projects increased their total supply when doing coin swaps such as VEN going to VET where they increased the total supply of the tokens and everyone received the same proportion. Those that do not stake are punished as they are not receiving the % increase in new supply and so their proportion is diluted. &gt;*There are many examples of some version of the following: Earn a 15% yield per annum when you stake on x network! This is at best misleading and at worst potentially fraudulent depending on the jurisdiction where these claims are being made. It causes token holders to evaluate and hold PoS tokens on a basis that isnt applicable or relevant. Even worse, using these words incorrectly can lead regulators to draw unnecessary negative conclusions about how to tax and regulate these networks/tokens: If you are calling it yield then it should be taxed as income* *Staking rewards  and the possibility of slashing  are a set of incentives that encourage token holders and validators to secure a PoS blockchain. In return, they maintain or grow their relative share of token holdings in the network. Staking creates the skin in the game necessary for good behavior such as running nodes in the network and discouraging bad behaviors like failing to remain online or double signing.* *Staking rewards do NOT exist to provide an income stream to token holders. Think instead, by staking I can increase my network participation (ownership if you like) by 0.3% over the following year or if I do not stake, my relative participation/ownership in the network will be diluted by 1.5% over the next 12 months.* *The economic rationale for staking a PoS token is not to receive yield (it doesnt exist) but because you believe that by doing so you will be growing your relative interest in the network and also contributing to significant token appreciation.* The above is taken from a great article which can be found [here](URL which explains the commonly misunderstood Staking Token and related terms such as Yield and Inflation. # Basic Example of how this works To see how it works lets look at a basic example. For simplicity assume there are only 2 Validators, Validator 1"" and Validator 2"" and there is a current total supply of 1000 tokens. 300 tokens are being staked with each Validator, with the validator for each staking 150 tokens and the delegators also staking 150 tokens. 60% of the total supply is staked whilst 40% is not staked. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; Again, to keep it simple rather than do the rewards per block i am just going to use the yearly figures. So, if total supply is 1000 and inflation is set at 20% then there will be 200 tokens to be minted over a year to be used for rewards and added to the total supply. So total supply now becomes 1200 and the 200 tokens are distributed according to the diagram below (and using the commission / staking values in the diagram above) &amp;#x200B; URL So now that the 200 tokens have been minted the total supply has now increased to 1200 and we can compare how the proportions of supply have changed. **The users that didnt stake**  initially had 40% of the supply, they have been penalized for not staking and now only own 33.33% of the supply. (Note they havent had any tokens removed from them its because additional tokens have been minted and they havent received a proportion of them by not staking.)  a decrease of 6.66% **Delegator using validator charging 20% commission**  Initially had 15% of the supply and now has 15.84% of the supply  an increase of 0.84% **Validator charging 20% commission**  Initially had 15% of the supply now has 17.5% of the supply  an increase of 2.5% **Validator charging 10% commission**  Initially had 15% of the supply now has 17.08% of the supply  an increase of 2.08% **Delegator using validator charging 10% commission**  Initially had 15% of the supply and now has 16.26% of the supply  an increase of 1.25% &amp;#x200B; URL You can see how the users that dont stake get penalized by not receiving rewards with the increase of additional supply. The proportion of supply that they lose gets transferred to those that stake. # 21 Day unbonding period To protect against a validator attacking the network and then immediately withdrawing his stake, the Cosmos Hub is enforcing a 21-day unbonding period. During this period, staked Atoms do not receive rewards anymore, but slashing is still possible. This means your Atoms are illiquid for 21-days after you decide to stop staking. You will not be able to trade them on an exchange etc until the 21 days have passed. There are however exchanges now looking at offering services where you keep your ATOM on their exchange, and they stake them for you. This has advantages of being able to day trade etc whilst still earning rewards to counter inflation. The downsides are that they normally charge high commission (30%), plus security wise its not great to have everyone leaving their tokens on an exchange as has been proven time and time again. The other potential issue is that it gives the exchanges a lot of voting power over the network if everyone uses them which creates centralisation and may be more inclined to vote on for governance that benefits them. EOS has this issue. &gt;*Whale Exchange, Newdex, Hufu, Bigone, and several other exchanges and wallets, have been elected as the top 10 BPs. In the meanwhile, the original supernodes, EOS Newyork, EOS42, EOS Authority, and EOS Canada, all have dropped out the top 21 rankings. Huobi Pool continues to see its dominance.* *At present, two of the top 5 ranked super nodes belong to one entity: EOSLaomao and Bigone exchanges both belong to the individual Laomao and team. The interests of the two are closely tied, and the strong essentially becomes stronger.* *And now we are seeing a phenomenon where an overarching number of top BPs are coming from mainland China, and in other words, we are seeing EOS even more centralized than before.* *Most of the top supernodes currently as of publishing date are either based in China or ran by a Chinese team* *Brian, the head of the EOS Amsterdam community, also believes that the exchange is considered to be the leader in the ecosystem. He is more worried, however, that the supernodes are almost occupied by mainland China nodes, leading to network security vulnerability, centralization and long-term negative PR. This would subsequently bring down the price of the token.* &gt; &gt; [URL # Slashing Staking is not without its risks and its important to choose a secure and trusted validator or risk having your tokens that are staked slashed. On the 29th June the first validator had all tokens that were staked with them slashed by 5% due to a misconfiguration which caused them to double sign a block. Whilst in this case, the slashing was neither the consequence of an attack on the network nor the result of a compromised validator key, it demonstrates that slashing is real and that validators should carefully design their infrastructure to mitigate the risk of losing their own and their delegators funds. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; # How to choose which Validator to delegate to? &gt;*The first metric I look at when evaluating validators is how much self-bond they have. If they have 30% or higher self-bond, this gives me confidence that they dont want to get slashed as much as I (delegator) dont want to get slashed. When a validator has low self-bond (1% or less), it makes me less likely to bond to them because they are playing with other peoples money, and theres less incentive for them to bolster their setups.* *Many of the top validators are highly visible by making their contributions to the ecosystem known. A lot of them have built useful tools that add to the richness of the Cosmos ecosystem, and thus you recognize their brand through their contribution. For example, you would know about a validator because youve used their block explorer. All this of course isnt telling of the hardness of their setups. This part is hard to verify yourself without going into their data centers and auditing their servers yourself. For now, doing your research on what theyve got set up as described by their website/content is the best option to understanding what kind of setup theyve built.* [URL Tendermint uses Proof of Stake where all validators are known before hand. The current maximum amount of Validators is 100. Validators run a full node for the Cosmos hub and provide its security, as well as being able to vote on Governance about future decisions for the Hub. The 100 Validators which stake the most ATOMs are selected. Currently the minimum amount of ATOM staked to be in the top 100 is 39,047 ATOMs. The amount of ATOMs staked by a Validator is a combination of ATOMs that the validator personally holds as well as Delegators, those that rather than run a validator, delegate their stake to another validator and receive a % of their rewards depending on the amount they delegate. There is normally a commision fee that the validator takes as a fee as a % of the rewards received for delegating to them which can normally ranges from 0% to 30% (can see in the picture below). This pays for the equipment, wages etc needed to run a secure validator. URL Tendermint requires 2/3 of votes for consensus to be reached. Currently 2/3 of the vote are controlled by the Top 16 Validators (so effectively if these all agree to vote on a proposal then that would be sufficient without the input of the other 84). If a validator / group of validators control more than 1/3 of the vote then whilst they cant force any changes through, they can prevent any further proposals from being accepted that they dont agree with regardless of what other validators vote. So the idea is to have the voting power distributed widely throughout the top 100 for more decentralisation. # Calculating the values for Cosmos ## Current Total Supply: There is no fixed total supply of ATOMs and the total supply will increase each year by between 7% and 20% due to inflation. [URL { ""not\_bonded\_tokens"": ""71341288426570"", ""bonded\_tokens"": ""170079253911157"" } Bonded Tokens + Not Bonded Tokens = Total Supply. The values in the API include 6 decimal places so you need to divide the number by 1,000,000. So to work out the total supply it would be: (71341288426570 + 170079253911157) / 1,000,000 = 241,420,542.337727 ATOM You then have a minimum of 7% and a maximum of 20% inflation per year on top of that depending on how much has been staked. ## Circulating Supply: The only tokens that are under a vesting period are for All in Bits Inc (AiB, the company doing business as Tendermint). They have a total of 23,619,895.81 ATOMs vested which are split into two sets, each subject to a different form of vesting. The first set consists of 1,777,707 ATOMs allocated to 44 addresses owned by AiB founders, contractors, and employees, current and past. These atoms are non-transferable for 12 months, but can be used for staking and governance. These will become unlocked on the 13th March 2020. The remaining set of AiBs atoms are held in an AiB multisig and vest continuously starting 2 months after genesis. This is a total of 21,842,188.81 ATOMs. Each month 992,826.76 of these are released on the 13th (Starting May 13th 2019 and finishing on March 13th 2021. So Circulating Supply = Total Supply  (Amount Vested by AIB) Circulating Supply = 241,039,982.546951  (1,777,707 (21,842,188.81  (3 x 992,826.76)) (represents 3 months which have been released so far) Circulating Supply = 220,398,567.016951 ATOMs Current Market Cap: $872,778,325.39 # How to work out Profit from Staking The Annual reward yield is currently 10.19 % which can be seen from sites such as [here](URL This is the bit where people get confused with staking. They see 10.19 % reward and think easy money, passive income etc. What you need to understand is that these rewards are from new ATOMs being minted and added to the supply via inflation. And so with a higher supply the value of each ATOM is worth less. ## Calculate effective reward rate in ATOMs ((100%  Commission Rate%) \* Yield Rate)  Inflation So if you delegate with a validator which charges 20% commission It would be (0.8 \* 10.19)  7.66 = **0.492% a year in ATOMs** ## Calculate effective profit in FIAT terms ATOMs hasnt been trading for a full year but if we take the first value in CMC which is $6.44 and is currently $3.95 which is a decrease of 38.66% per ATOM. The yearly reward yield is 10.19% so in profit terms its 10.1938.66 = -28.47% Profit in USD Terms = 10.1938.66 = **a loss of 28.47% in USD** ## Calculate effective profit in BTC terms At the start of trading each ATOM was worth 0.00164490 satoshis, as of the time of this writing they are now 0.00037155 satoshis which is a decrease of 77.41% Profit in BTC terms = Reward Rate + Change in Price per ATOM in BTC over year Profit in BTC Terms = 10.1977.41 = **a loss of 67.22 % in BTC** Note that these calculations do not include transaction costs for traffic going through the Hub. Once IBC is released (minimum viable product version is supposed to be at the end of this year, so i would estimate mid next year for full feature version to be released), adoption of the ecosystem will increase and zones will be transferring between each other over hubs then additional revenue is earned via transaction fees of other tokens. This site you can see the correct value for Total Supply, % Bonded and Inflation Rate [URL Be warned there are some other sites such as [URL which show incorrect values (for example they say the staking ratio is currently 88.06% which is incorrect and skews the figures for rewards. Mintscan is accurate and the API site that i listed before is direct from the Cosmos Official website so is correct. [URL"

21,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Top 5 Crypto Coins With A Lot Of Promise That Never Made It,0,cmac22,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/cmac22/top_5_crypto_coins_with_a_lot_of_promise_that/,2019-08-05 22:26:08,"&amp;#x200B; URL The cryptocurrency market is littered with what most people call dead coins. These are cryptocurrencies that exist with almost no market value mostly as a result of insignificant network effect. Several reasons could lead to a cryptocurrency becoming a dead coin, even though in the actual sense it is difficult to establish that a coin is completely dead. Some of these reasons include the disappearance of a project team, inability to follow through on promises, bad management, conflict within a projects community and outright scam. In the past decade that cryptocurrencies have existed, many coins have fallen into this category. Lets take a look at the top 5 cryptocurrencies with a lot of promise that never made it. **5. SpaceBIT** The goal of SpaceBIT, at least what was communicated to the public, was to create a blockchain product that will launch several nano-satellites into space providing a globally accessible blockchain. This idea was made known to the public in 2014, and news about it was still all over the blockchain industry into 2015 and the community waited with palpable enthusiasm. Everyone looked forward to the project until the propagators went silent. Reports indicate that the SpaceBIT team diverted into another project, BlockVerify. This took their attention off SpaceBIT and it became an abandoned project till date. **4. GEMS** Gems, which later became GetGems tried to build a decentralized social app that will reward users for viewing advertisements within the app. At the time, the project team described it as the eventual disruptor of social media as we knew it. Unfortunately for Gems, a failed crowdsale exercise in 2014 discouraged the team and community over the planned execution. Only $111,000 was raised during the crowdsale, in an ecosystem that similar projects were raising millions of dollars. The team continued with the development of the project still, but adoption level is nothing to write home about. **3. DODGECOIN** Also created in 2014 in what looked like an unserious ambition, DODGE became a cryptocurrency that was used by its community for charitable causes. A popular case was when it was used to raise funds to sponsor the Jamaican bobsled team to the winter Olympics. This act boosted publicity for the coin and it grew. Unfortunately, the Dodgecoin exchange crashed, and the founder, Alex Green vanished with all the funds. That was it for DODGE which still exists today, but in a crashed mode with almost nothing to show for its past performance. **2. PAYCOIN** Paycoin fell really hard in 2015 after its founder Josh Garza fled the US while being investigated for fraudulent activities surrounding the project. The journey of Paycoin started in 2014 with a beautifully crafted whitepaper that attracted a sizeable community. With GAW miners, who were in partnership with Garza at the time, failing to follow through with its promises, things began to go south for the project. GAW finally shut down in 2015, leading to investigation by the authorities, which led to the fleeing of Garza as mentioned above. The community that Garza left behind have tried to revive the project, all to no avail. **1. DAO** Ethereums DAO breach of 2016 remains the biggest fail so far in the cryptocurrency industry. The promise of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) was too good that its tokens were bought in droves during a crowdsale. The over $168 million achievement in the DAO crowdsale was a record-breaking event. In June 2016, an attacker took advantage of a vulnerability in the DAO system and stole $50 million. This was the beginning of the end for DAO, as traders dumped the token. Ultimately, this was what led to the eventual fork of Ethereum to create the new Ethereum platform with the Ether tokens, alongside the existing Ethereum Classic platform with token ETC. **Conclusion** Coin fails are common in the crypto world and a lot of investors are still suffering from the losses sustained from failed projects. However, things are beginning to change in the industry, with the [CoinJanitor](URL project determined to revive the so-called dead coins, bringing liquidity back to their owners. The aim of CoinJanitor is to identify dead coins with large communities that are unable to trade their purchased tokens, helping users who have put money into the market, get money out. CoinJanitor restores the dead coins value through JAN coins, which can be traded on several exchanges. This is an interesting arrangement that will certainly draw the attention of a lot of investors in the cryptocurrency market. [URL"

Another limitation of the swap protocol presented here is the assumption that the swap digraph, its leaders, and their hash locks are common knowledge among the participants. Future work might address constructing and propagating this information dynamically **Other solutions** Smart Swap is a P2P trading technology built on the Ethereum network. The key aspects of Smart Swap are (1) Its 100% decentralized (2) eliminate the need for trust between the parties. Its secure, easy to implement, protects the user against losses in case of currency rate changes and it doesnt require blockchains involvement to have code abilities and the same Hash algorithm (like Atomic Swap does).

29,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,14 Things We Learned Creating a Million Dollar Hyperdeflationary Currency,1865,bt0wi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bt0wi0/14_things_we_learned_creating_a_million_dollar/,2019-05-26 09:07:24,"Four months ago we made a [reddit post](URL announcing a social experiment to create a **self-destructing currency** called [BOMB](URL The reactions were polarizing, to say the least: Some comments were [positive](URL &gt;*A currency that no one wants to spend but everyone wants to have would result in an ever growing value. However, it might only be on paper because no one wants to spend it. I wonder what will happen. I really hope this gains popularity, very interesting.* Many comments were [negative](URL &gt;*Aaand this is why crypto is viewed with such cynicism. People can literally create their own private currencies in their basements.* Multiple comments were [entertaining](URL &gt;LOL, I wonder how many FBI safeguards this will trigger. The success and legitimacy of the project were still to be determined, but one thing was for sure: ***people were curious.*** &amp;#x200B; # The Big Bang &amp;#x200B; On January 15th, we launched one million [BOMB](URL into the digital abyss known as the blockchain. The rules of the currency were simple: * Only 1,000,000 BOMB would be created. * Each time the BOMB is transferred, 1% is destroyed * There would never be a newly created BOMB. Over the following months, more than [750,000 tokens](URL were distributed for free, over [3,000 individuals](URL participated, and over [20,000 BOMB](URL were burned through transfers and trading (2% of total supply). The [social communities](URL grew into the multiple thousands, and many [respected projects](URL began getting involved. The intention was not to be used as a transactional currency, but rather a consistently deflating and decentralized store of value. The problem we were attempting to solve (or at least experiment with) is the [token velocity problem](URL that plagues many of the tokens in the market today. The goal was to become *the* deflationary currency of the decentralized world. Many currencies focus on speed, cost, and privacy. We focus on deflation. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [BTC vs. BOMB](URL &amp;#x200B; # The Journey &amp;#x200B; The reaction of the events over the next months took us down a winding road of adventure and a fair share of heart attacks. One day we would get an endorphin rush after the co-creator of the #[OccupyWallStreet](URL movement [wrote an article](URL the next day we would find a major vulnerability in the code that would literally cause us to [re-issue tokens](URL Through it all, the journey has been a rewarding one, and we learned a lot along the way. Here are the top 14 things we learned while creating a million dollar hyper deflationary currency. &amp;#x200B; # 1) A Deflationary Asset Can Survive... So Far At Least. &amp;#x200B; One of the biggest things we wanted to learn when starting the social experiment was to ask: &gt;Can a deflationary asset survive? &amp;#x200B; Good question in theory, but how do you measure that? Do you measure it by price? Do you measure it by how many people hold it? Do you measure by usage? Within the community, one of our members recently public a [The Bomb Report](URL a case study breakdown of some really interesting statistics and analysis of the currency and the success/failures it has had so far. &amp;#x200B; [Bombs Burned Per Day](URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [Total Bombs Burned Over Time](URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [Price vs Total Burned Percentage](URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; # 2) If You Build it, They Wont Come &amp;#x200B; The blockchain industry consists of some of the most talented technical and visionary minds in the world. However, despite this, most average consumers havent experienced a blockchain application or used the currencies built on top of it. While there is still plenty of time for true mass adoption to occur, it has become clear that the amount of technical value being developed is not equating to the amount of activity or users. We believe this is not for lack of building, but for lack of storytelling and communication. Average consumers dont resonate with technological features, they resonate with the stories and the advantages within a solution. Bitcoin, the most successful cryptocurrency to date, has one of the best stories behind it. An anonymous and mystical figure behind the name of Satoshi Nakamoto took his passion and pain from the financial crisis of 2008 to create a better solution. The building behind BOMB wasnt intensive or complex at all, just a few dozen lines of code in solidity. But that wasnt our story. Our story was our journey and social experimentation of a deflationary currency. That is why people joined, and this is what keeps people intrigued still to this day. &amp;#x200B; # 3) Hodling is Still Alive &amp; Kicking &amp;#x200B; Despite the average airdrop value sitting over $200 per participant, **84.5% of people have not touched or moved their BOMB**. Out of 3073 current addresses, 2604 people would rather hold than sell their BOMB. &amp;#x200B; # 4) The Cryptocurrency Industry is Skeptical by Default &amp;#x200B; Despite giving away all our tokens for free and answering questions as transparently as possible, the default response was skepticism; and rightfully so. Despite over [$13,000,000,000](URL in public capital allocated to the decentralized world in the first half of 2018 alone, over [1000 projects are now dead](URL Many of the people who joined the industry joined during this time and still feel the resentment to this day. While it will probably take many years to overcome this skepticism, and may never go away, we learned it is important to take every comment and negative remark in stride. Some are valid concerns, but a majority arent actually mad or disgruntled with you, but at the industry as a whole. &amp;#x200B; # 5) Going from 0 to 1 is 10x harder than 1 to 10 &amp;#x200B; Like most projects, when we started, our followers and community count started at zero. During the first few weeks of sharing the story of BOMB with a few friends, the growth was extremely slow (relative to what it is today) at maybe 15 people per day. Nobody wants to be the first to the party. When youre walking down the street, everyone assumes the crowded bar is better than the empty bar. The one thing you can do to overcome this early stage is making your early adopters feel like absolute VIPs. More than the early adopters getting more free tokens than everyone else, myself and the co-creators spent endless hours on telegram talking with each and every single person who joined. There was not a lost soul who wandered into our group that didnt get an overly ambitious introduction. This is the core and foundation that will set everything in motion. While I no longer introduce myself to every new person to the group, our community does, and its an amazing feeling. &amp;#x200B; # 6) Clear &amp; Concise Communication is Everything &amp;#x200B; When I first started telling my friends about BOMB, the natural response was What else does it do? We as humans have a natural instinct to think more is better. Many founders start with a very clear mission to create something like a comfortable chair but they end up explaining their product as an Anti-Gravitational Sitting Apparatus to Disrupt the Entire Furniture Industry with Built-in LED Lights and Omni-Rocking Functionality The problem is when we try to communicate this vision to the world, our vision becomes convoluted and messy. The most successful projects to date consist of the ones doing one thing better than anyone else. When people explain *what* BOMB is, they explain it very clearly and concisely: A deflationary currency. When people explain *how* BOMB works, they easily recall and reference the three rules of the currency as stated above. &amp;#x200B; # 7) Transparently Bad News is Better than No News &amp;#x200B; The biggest OH SNAP moment for BOMB occurred in February, just a few weeks after airdropping our creation to the world. A community member following the project found an error on the code that could open up the currency to exploitation in the future. Rather than attempting to hide the situation, we made a [medium post](URL to explain the situation and news to the community. Just a few weeks ago, many of our community members began to get anxious about a potential exchange listing that was taking longer than expected. While frustrating to take criticism for items we couldnt control, we wrote a 19 thread tweet storm titled [Transparency Update](URL Despite the negative news, the community loved it and felt closer to the project than ever. People many times dont mind what happened, as long as they understand why you did it, and the reasoning behind it. Yes, there will always be that 10% that wont accept your answer. But the people who truly care about your vision and value will stick with you. Those are the people who matter. &amp;#x200B; ## 8) You Dont Need to Spend $25,000 on an Exchange &amp;#x200B; Getting on an exchange after raising zero capital was definitely hard. We made a commitment early on that we would never ask our community for money, so everything we did had to be extremely scrappy and resourceful. To help get us off the ground, a few of our early members kept talking about a community/technology called [ParJar](URL In short, this was a telegram bot we could implement that allowed our community to openly trade BOMB instantly and feeless whenever they wanted. There are a lot of items that helped us build our community, but we believe ParJar gave us more native engagement than any other campaign we have done. This organic incentivization ecosystem for individuals to exchange assets was and continues to be the backbone and foundation for our growth. &amp;#x200B; # 9) Not All Exchanges Are Created Equal &amp;#x200B; Even at the peak of the bear market, exchanges attempted to charge anywhere between $20,000 and $250,000; and those were the low-level ones. We definitely couldnt afford this. After doing more research, we narrowed down our goals with exchanges and what we were trying to accomplish. While many projects immediately want to get on the bigger volume markets, [research showed](URL there were only a handful of exchanges that had real volume. The rest were doing a lot of wash trading. Instead of going after the top level exchanges, we focused on connecting with other respected and up-and-coming exchanges that would be willing to work with us on integration. The deflationary features inside our contract make us incompatible with many exchanges. This was a full-time job in itself. After many months of searching, we were able to really connect with the team at [DDEX](URL (an exchange that is venture backed by reddits co-founder) that saw the potential in BOMB and took a chance on us. &amp;#x200B; # 10) Liquidity Premium is a Real Thing &amp;#x200B; While I have heard the term Liquidity Premium before, I didnt quite know how this would impact a deflationary currency. In short, a liquidity premium occurs when something costs more/less because it has high/low liquidity. The best way for me to think of this is a house. Although houses are valuable, they many times take months to be sold or liquidated for cash. Because of this, prices can be up to 2030% lower than it would be if it were liquid. In relation to BOMB, our goal from the beginning was to decrease token velocity as much as possible. The side effect of this was low liquidity. As soon as we reached [Mercatox](URL (a centralized exchange that didnt burn the tokens) BOMB value increased by nearly 2550% overnight. Of course, we can probably attribute some of this to new eyeballs and demand, but it has been interesting to watch the arbitrage between a DEX (burns BOMB) and a CEX (doesnt burn BOMB). &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [Growth after Liquidity](URL &amp;#x200B; # 11) The Market Decides Value, Not the Founders &amp;#x200B; One of the biggest questions we got in the early days was: &gt;How much are BOMB worth? When we explained that the tokens were being given away for free, many equated this to *no value*. In traditional coins or tokens, the value is determined (or at least decided) by the founders at the price they are willing to sell them at. If XYZ project decides to launch an ICO and sell them at $1, that is the given value of the token. The problem with this premise is that this initial value is completely arbitrary and theoretical until it can be actively traded. I can attempt to sell my car for $250,000, but if the market will only pay me $250, thats what its worth. If we learned one thing from the 2018 bear market, its that the founders of projects are very bad at knowing the intrinsic value of their own tokens; many times [9099% off](URL Rather than giving our token an arbitrary number, we gave every single token away for free and let the world decide its value. &amp;#x200B; # 12) Capital is a Luxury, Not a Necessity &amp;#x200B; In the startup world, people many times reference the [Lean Startup](URL approach. The premise is pretty simple, get your idea into the world for as little amount of money as possible, and see if the world is willing to give it value. In the cryptocurrency world, everything seems to be backward. Cryptocurrencies spend months planning an ICO, then another few years developing a project, only to find out if their idea is worth building. Millions of dollars are spent on the building before confirming the demand. IF you truly believe you have an idea that people want or need, and IF you are willing/able to build an MVP first, and IF you want to build a community fueled project; give a portion away for free and let the market decide your fate. Then, if the market gives it a thumbs up, you have some liquid capital to build your grand vision; all while raising zero capital. &amp;#x200B; # 13) Code is Replicable, Community is Not &amp;#x200B; One mission of BOMB from the beginning was to hopefully provide a financial case study for other people to learn from and implement into their own tokenomic structure. We anticipated and expected others to do this. But, what we did not expect is the number of exact copy cats that would arise of the first weeks. At this time on Etherscan, there are more than five other replicas of BOMB that people created. While we were originally discouraged at others attempting to directly imitate our project, we quickly learned that what made BOMB special was no the code, but the community of people around what we were creating. You can copy code, but you cant copy a community. &amp;#x200B; # 14) People Who Truly Believe in Something Will Go Above and Beyond &amp;#x200B; To this day, we havent paid anything beyond a few #[BombUp](URL rewards to our community. And yet, they do some of the most creative, amazing, and impressive creations we could have ever asked for. &amp;#x200B; [**Report**](URL An in-depth financial and data-driven report on BOMB explosions, price, and analytics trends. [**Art**](URL Everything from designs to stickers for the community to use and play with. **Bomb Up****:** A community member-run group that gives away BOMB every day for playing telegram games. [**Articles**](URL Some of the most passionate people writing in-depth articles about the project. **Languages:** Alternative languages that wanted to discuss BOMB in Russian and German. &amp;#x200B; # Conclusion &amp;#x200B; There is no doubt that to some, BOMB will be nothing more than a meme coin, and we are okay with that. One of the most fascinating parts of this experiment has been watching our original meaning, goal, and vision of BOMB change and evolve for other people over time. Instead of attempting to control the dialogue, we let the community interpret the project in whatever way they want. This individual empowerment has truly given the currency a life of its own and the amount of fun, insight, and overall awesome people we have been able to connect within our short lifespan has been nothing short of amazing. At the current rate of deflation, if the current pace stays constant the last BOMB is expected o be destroyed by 2031. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ &amp;#x200B; ***If you would prefer reading or sharing this story through a medium format,*** [here is the link](URL"

A minimum of 11 million private and public photographs have been exposed. Not all information was leaked but usernames, first and last names, as well as captions, were exposed along with the images. &amp;#x200B; It was only last month that Instagram had a data breach that left 49 million users actual sensitive data online allowing anyone to access. Data such as biodata, profile picture, the number of followers they have, their location by city and country, and contact information like the Instagram account owners email address and phone number. &amp;#x200B; Even WhatsApp also last month which is owned by Facebook as many of you know, had discovered a vulnerability which let hackers install spyware via an infected WhatsApp voice call. &amp;#x200B; What are the changes that tech giants and major social sharing platforms would be more secure by using blockchain to store information? Facebook, for example, relies on having access to user data for the core of their business so using blockchain, how do they keep that power without the chance of someone breaching the security? &amp;#x200B; There are already a few blockchain based social media platforms such as Akasha, Peepeth, indorse and steemit and which are built on the blockchain but none yet have made it into the tradition space yet. &amp;#x200B; Vid looks really interesting as an Instagram / Youtube alternative. The UI looks great and its main focus is on creating auto-generated video memories and securing them using Zero Knowledge encryption. Not even Vid can see them unless you make them public so no chance of data breaches like current social platforms. Users and influencers can also monetize their content directly with advertisers without the company taking a huge chunk of that revenue. &amp;#x200B; With over 5 billion users between the 5 largest social media platforms, I think each one of them has experienced a major data leak in its time. It is our content, they make money from it but cannot even keep it secure.

It resolves all of the main chalenges we faced as scalability, micropayments and transaction fees. However, having in mind that after year the miners rewards will be cutted down to 6.25 BTC and the main part of transactions will be proceeded outside the BTC blockchain what could we expect: 1) surprisingly high transaction fees 1.1. so some users may preffer to move to some feeless blockchins (may be You remember RaiBlocks surge during the last peak) and such actions may 1.2. prevent the price to go too high 2) (which is more important) If too much miners can not cover anymore their costs with these rewards and leave the nodes, will it 2.1. make the 51% attach vulnerability to rise too high? I am NOT sure if mine thoughts are reasonible, so want to let`s disscus to make it clear."
33,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,RECAP OF NEBULAS AMA,1,bgxayb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bgxayb/recap_of_nebulas_ama/,2019-04-25 03:17:41," \*\*Nebulas AMA with Dr. Xuepeng Fan and Ecosystem Growth, Marketing Executive of Nebulas, Ruby Wu.\*\* On April 24th 2019, Dr. Xuepeng Fan and Ecosystem Growth, Marketing Executive of Nebulas, Ruby Wu. Took the the time to talk to the community and answered many questions via the Nebulas English Telegram channel. The topic of the AMA was ""The first on-chain vote via Nebulas NOVA."" but also other questions where answered. We have also chosen the 10 questions submitted via Twitter/Reddit that will receive a 5 NAS reward. The winners are announced at the bottom of this article: Okay, lets get to the questions. \*\*Question 1:\*\* What happens if there are not enough applicants for the council, federation and tech committee? The amount of NAS required makes it almost impossible for regular community members. Answer 1: If no enough applicants, things will be delayed. However, seems we already have enough candidates, so thats not our main concern now. \*\*Question 2:\*\* How many NAT tokens will be issued and what is the formula for determining how many each wallet will get? When is the snapshot being taken for this and how often will it be done? Answer 2: About 100,000,000,000 NAT tokens will be issued totally. We will uncover the details in the governance paper later, which will be released soon. The issue of NAT happens in every week, so there is no snapshot. \*\*Question 3:\*\* I want to create a NRC-721 standard (non-fungible tokens) under Nebulas. What do I need to do in order to make it official? \*\*Answer 3:\*\* We really appreciate this work. Its really simple, you just create the NRC-721 contract and submit it to our official wiki. Then everyone in Nebulas community will appreciate your contribution. Nebulas is opensource and a community project. So we need every one in the community. \*\*Question 4:\*\* Is there any plans to push NAS into [Shapeshift.io](URL \*\*Answer 4:\*\* Not yet. Were focusing on technologies on Nebulas. And we wanna leave these ecosystem efforts to the whole community. We believe the community will do a better job than us. We're not experts in all fields. \*\*Question 5:\*\* Is there any really dumbed-down PDF or tutorial that one can read to understand what is Nebulas exactly and how it can help the average Joe? \*\*Answer 5:\*\* Thats really a tough question. I think the best way is to read the official wiki. And if you have any questions, just talk to anyone in the community. Yes, we do have some PDF or tutorials, but they are not that easy to understand. The more important thing is that Nebulas is a community project, and its not only defined by us. Its defined by the community, and the community shares their knowledge on the official wiki. We hope you can share your thoughts on the wiki too. In the long run, Nebulas hope to achieve our vision as  Let everyone get values from decentralized collaboration fairly. This is not easy, and we are forging ahead step by step towards it, with the support of Nebulas NOVA, our community governance structure and the support of our community, we believe we are one step closer to the goal. \*\*Question 6:\*\* I've read that Nebulas Rank is impervious to Sybil attacks. Can you say that NR is immune to any other similar attack? And in the event someone discovers a vulnerability in NR, how fast can Nebulas Team fix it? \*\*Answer 6:\*\* Seems you have a deep understanding of NR. NR is not immune to all kinds of attacks. The gaming problem on the blockchain is really complicated and we are excited to see new attacks. Fixing a vulnerability in NR shall be very fast since we have NBRE. That means we can update NR implementation in just a few blocks. Let us know if you find such vulnerabilities in NR, :) \*\*Question 7:\*\* How will the NAT tokens work? What will it take to vote with these NAT tokens? Do you plan to make a video to show how it will work? \*\*Answer 7:\*\* NAT token info is disclosed step by step recently Check our recently medium announcement and you could know how could you get NAT airdrop, whether you have NR or not Voting wise, proposals including the parameters of Nebulas mainnet, like our gas fee, the parameters for DIP and the projects on go nebulas, changes on our governance structure and etc. will be decided by community voting and the only voting token will be NAT. \*\*Question 8:\*\* Will users who get voted into the council position receive #NAT on their 100,000 $NAS collateral during the initial 6 month holding period? Also, will the founders have access to the NAT from their locked NAS funds? \*\*Answer 8:\*\* A good question. A simple answer is no, only the NAS tokens that locked up in the voting smart contract will be able to receive NAT. \*\*Question 9:\*\* What is the plan from the team to increase the visibility of gonebulas? The few number of users using the platform is quite alarming and the lack of votes influence the development of Nebulas \*\*Answer 9:\*\* We are expecting the issuance of NAT to incentive our community members to be more active in voting, this is also one goal when we design the token economy for NAT. The visibility of go.nebulas relies on the contribution of our community as well. Currently, all the work within the previous core team of Nebulas is all open on Go Nebulas, and we tried our best to keep all the project updated on the platform. More transparency relies on complete market competition, we hope all community members could come and leave your voice on the platform. We need a bigger market and more participants. \*\*Question 10:\*\* What's the limit of TPS the mainnet can withstand right now? \*\*Answer 10:\*\* Its about 2000 TPS now. But still, we don't think TPS should be the key focus for blockchain as long as it is not a constraint \*\*Question 11:\*\* Is Nebulas planning on having a desktop and hardware wallet. Just feel like there more options to store NAS would be better than just Nas Nano Pro. \*\*Answer 11:\*\* Not yet. However, there are some proposals to develop such alternatives from the community. For example, [URL And we do care about ledger either it is from the community or supported officially by Nebulas Foundation. \*\*Question 12:\*\* Hello, I have a question regarding the on-chain voting system on Nebulas. I was watching today the whole day 1 of the AION Rebuild event, and how all the panelists throughout the day were all talking and praising the concept of on-chain governance and community vote, and it just kept making me think of Nebulas how early they have thought of it and i find it absolutely incredible how ahead of the curve we are and how the Nebulas team has been delivering so far. truly exceptional. Something did come up during the Polkadot panelist, how he was mentioning how they will have on-chain governance and voting, and how they have a system in place in the event of a low turnout of voters, giving the power to the council as a plan B to vote Ayes or Nayes. It appears that low public voting has been an issue in the space, specifically with the project MAKER early on. My question is how does Nebulas plan to work around the current state of the market with low public votes? hoping that projects just don't get killed if they do not go through the votes. Surely 1000 votes at the moment isn't a very realistic number. Also, is Nebulas keeping a close eye on other projects progress in the space such as AION, Cosmos, Polkadot, amongst others, who are planning to implement the same type of onchain governance as Nebulas? Thank you. \*\*Answer 12:\*\* Firstly, 1000 is not a constant number, so don't be scared. It will only exist during the transitional period before we have the voting token NAT goes live. Actually, given the current budget supported by Nebulas Foundation for the projects on Go Nebulas, only the projects with budget below 5000 NAS will be considered before June 23, when the 35mln community portion of NAS is activated, For budget below 5000 NAS, you need maximum 100 votes. Secondly, when NAT goes alive, two things will happen: 1. the address who actively involves in voting will get an incentive in NAT from voting, which would largely promote to the participation rate of voting. 2. the voting quorum will not be a constant, it will be decided by the onchain liquidity of NAS and the NR of entire mainnet and the amount of budget the project is planning to claim. It will be a dynamic equilibrium situation. \*\*Question 13:\*\* Why is the voting for the DIP and GAS change proposals being done outside of go nebulas? They should have been done inside the platform to bring visibility to it. \*\*Answer 13:\*\* Because it is about the parameter in Nebulas mainnet and involves no budget, go nebulas it for community collaboration. \*\*Question 14:\*\* I am a normal non-technical community member. How can I help the ecosystem and improve my NR at the same time? \*\*Answer 14:\*\* NR could be simply improved by making onchain transactions check here. [URL Also, even if your address dont have NR, you still have chance to earn NAT. More details will be disclosed recently. Hope this is clear. \*\*Question 15:\*\* I did read something about NASlockup to receive NAT. does this mean we will be able in the future to send our NAS to a smart contract and receive NAT? \*\*Answer 15:\*\* Pretty much so. \*\*Question 16:\*\* Will in June of this year circulation supply be 80 millions of Nas? \*\*Answer 16:\*\* Ok, this involves quite profound understanding about Nebulas governance 35mln is reserved as community development as described in our white paper, and from June on, this portion will be handled for Nebulas Council to supervise and have the entire community to govern. \*\*Question 17:\*\* What is the most motivation should be for the people to buy and hold Nebulas aside from airdrops and Binance promotions? will holders have any way to grow their NAS by launching a node or delegation system? \*\*Answer 17:\*\* I think different people have different motivation. For you I think it should be NAT. You could get NR by holding NAS, and therefore NAT. Besides, NR means a lot of things on Nebulas, like DIP and PoD. \*\*Question 18:\*\* Will you be able to trade nat tokens? \*\*Answer18:\*\* Technically, NAT is just another NRC-20 token, so should be able to trade. \*\*Question 19:\*\* When will we be able to launch a node? \*\*Answer 19\*\*: Not decided yet. Basically shall be launched around July this year. \*\*winners of the 5 NAS reward!\*\* prior to the AMA, We asked the community to submit questions via Twitter/Reddit and the questions with the most combined up-votes/retweets would receive 5 NAS each.

The excerpt below is taken from Blockport's updated whitepaper. &amp;#x200B; **3.1.7. Hybrid-decentralized architecture (addressing a lack of usability and security)** &amp;#x200B; Blockports hybrid-decentralized architecture combines the best of both centralized and decentralized models. &amp;#x200B; The first feature of this architecture gives users the choice to store their funds in a centralized way to enable high performance trading, or store them directly on the blockchain, thereby allowing them to own and manage their own private keys. This way, users can easily choose between storing their funds for trading on the platform, or safely store it on the blockchain for long term investments. This includes a unique on- and off-chain protocol that allows users to manage their own private keys. &amp;#x200B; The second feature addresses the issue of safe and easy-to-use private key management. If users want to store their funds in a safe and decentralized way, they dont want to deal with the hassle of storing and managing multiple private keys for every chain. Neither do they want to be confronted with the disastrous consequences of losing their private keys. In order to solve this, we are internally developing decentralized asset management features (dWallet). More detailed information about these features will be described in chapter 3.3. &amp;#x200B; The final milestone is developing and integrating decentralized trading infrastructure into the platform. By doing so, we initiate the massive potential of global integration between fiat and crypto-enabled technology in a seamless and extremely secure way. Usability, stability, and performance remain top priority at every stage in the path towards this milestone. Status: in research &amp; refinement (see in-depth vision and strategy in chapter 3.3) &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; \--- &amp;#x200B; Blockport is also one of the very first Blockchain companies in Europe to hold their own fully compliant and regulated Security Token Offering (STO), which is going on NOW and ends May 15th. STO funds will be allocated to expedited global expansion (USA specifically), a USD fiat gateway and a BPT (the platform utility token) ""buy"" program."
35,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,About Binance hack from the point of cybersecurity,1,bmgryo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/bmgryo/about_binance_hack_from_the_point_of_cybersecurity/,2019-05-09 17:33:43,"Hi all, Last month Binance started a bounty bug program, here the error has occurred which has allowed the platform to be hacked. Normally when carrying out a bounty bug program, accesses and environments are limited so that ""white hackers"" can test vulnerabilities and report them. Limiting this type of activity reduces the risk of a black hacker exploiting a vulnerability with a criminal purpose. To this end, measures are implemented (Monitoring via alerts, perimeter protection, SIEM, etc.). Binance opened a large security hole by allowing a test in a preproduction environment which was the same as the production one. This has allowed bugs to be found that could be exploited in productive environments in the same way. A poorly done bounty bug is a shot to yourself, in this case I think it has been what happened. A badly done limitation allows external users to discover more errors than they should without the platform owner having control over it."

46,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,WARNING - Coinomi Wallet CRITICAL Vulnerability Made Me Lose My Life Savings,512,av7gfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/av7gfi/warning_coinomi_wallet_critical_vulnerability/,2019-02-27 12:36:22,"***Please note that you can view a better version of this post here:*** [URL # TL;DR [Coinomi](URL multi-asset wallet poor implementation leads to sharing your plain-text passphrase with a third-party server. My passphrase was compromised and $60K-$70K worth of crypto-currency were stolen because of Coinomi wallet and how the wallet handled my passphrase. Im disclosing this issue publicly because Coinomi refused to take the responsibility and all my attempts through private channels have failed. Please note that this security issue cannot be exploited by anyone except by the people who created it or have control over the backend. To everyone who is using or used Coinomi wallet, make sure to remove your funds from the wallet and change your passphrase by creating a new wallet using another application otherwise your funds might get stolen sooner or later. To understand how catastrophic the security issue is, they simply take your crypto-currency wallets passphrases/seeds and spell check it by sending it remotely to Google servers in clear plain text! They did not take the responsibility of my loss, I gave them more than 24 hours before full disclosure, they fixed the issue without notifying their users and they kept procrastinating like scumbags to buy more time. Below is a link to their final response to my request after going back and forth with them for over 3 days to get my stolen funds back, even after they confirmed the security issue and you can clearly see how silly and reckless their responses are (these responses are just examples): [URL My advice never ever trust Coinomi with your hard earned crypto-currency assets. Read this post entirely to understand why because this is not their first time reflecting this kind behavior. # The Incident First of all I admit it was my mistake trusting Coinomi wallet by inserting one of my main wallets (Exodus wallet) passphrase into their application. I trusted them because I downloaded the software from their website, the setup file was digitally signed and was mentioned by several reputable websites such as [bitcoinwiki.org](URL I wanted to shift some of the assets that were not supported by Exodus wallet using the same passphrase/seed. The incident began on 14th February, 2019. I downloaded and installed Coinomi application (Windows version) and noticed that their setup file was digitally signed but their main application was NOT signed after the installation process was completed. I contacted them publicly through twitter ([@warith2020](URL and they confirmed the issue then uploaded a new version with the main application signed. At that time I had already entered my Exoduss wallet passphrase into Coinomis application. On 22nd February 2019, I noticed that more than 90% of my Exodus wallet assets were transferred to multiple wallet addresses and the first transaction began with BTC on 19th February 2019 around 3:30 am UTC. Then followed by ETH (including ERC20 tokens), LTC and finally BCH. # Technical Analysis I started going back in time and arranging the events. The only new thing that I did was installing and running Coinomi wallet so my first conclusion was that the unsigned version of the application had a backdoor. I did further investigation and compared both the unsigned version of the setup file and the signed version. The only difference was they added digital signature to the main executable file and the Java file (the main application). At that stage I thought that there is probably something suspicious about the application apart from having their main executable unsigned, so I started replicating what I did in a new virtual machine but this time I installed Fiddler. A software that allows you to monitor and debug HTTP/HTTPS traffic of all applications running on your machine. I started monitoring the traffic by running Fiddler in the background and then started Coinomi wallet. The first thing I noticed is that Coinomi application starts downloading dictionary wordlist from the following web address: [URL &amp;#x200B; Then I clicked on restore wallet and pasted a random passphrase and suddenly the screen screamed SURPRISE MOTHER\*\*\*\*\*\* (boom puzzle solved!) The WHOLE passphrase in plain-text is sent to [googleapis.com](URL a domain name owned by Google! It was sending it as a spelling check function! Here is sample of the screenshot of the HTTP request: [URL &amp;#x200B; To verify my findings I have uploaded a video for anyone who wants to test and replicate what I did: [URL &amp;#x200B; You can also simply paste any random sentence with spelling mistake in the textbox in Coinomis Restore Wallet form/page and you will see that it gets underlined with red line after being sent in clear text to [googleapis.com](URL To understand whats going on, I will explain it technically. Coinomi core functionality is built using Java programming language. The user interface is designed using HTML/JavaScript and rendered using integrated Chromium (Googles open-source project) based browser. The whole thing is done using JxBrowser to build cross-platform applications and before you say (like Coinomis CTO did) that its JxBrowser issue, let me tell you that they mentioned this on their website in 2016 and how to disable the spell checking default behavior: [URL &amp;#x200B; So essentially the textbox which you enter your passphrase in, is basically an HTML file ran by Chromium browser component and once you type or paste anything in that textbox it will immediately and discreetly send it remotely to [googleapis.com](URL for spelling check (how awesome is that!) As a result, someone from Googles team or whoever had access to the HTTP requests that are sent to [googleapis.com](URL found the passphrase and used it to steal my $60K-$70K worth crypto assets (at current market price). Anyone who is involved in technology and crypto-currency knows that a 12 random English words separated by spaces will probably be a passphrase to a crypto-currency wallet! # Coinomis Response The team behind Coinomi are either extremely smart to add such backdoor so that when they get caught they would simply say it was an honest mistake or they are extremely stupid to overlook such security bug. I will not be surprised if they intentionally created this backdoor behavior function and had an insider at Google especially when you learn from recent news about a founder of crypto-currency exchange claiming weird suspicious death while no one except him has access to the crypto-currency assets! Coinomis team did not reflect any responsible behavior and they kept asking me about the technical issue behind the bug because they were worried about their public image and reputation. They kept ignoring my request of taking the responsibility and ignored my solid facts regarding it. They didnt give a single \*\*\*\* about my stolen crypto assets. They kept reminding me (kinda threatening me) of the legal implications if I go public with the information I have and they forgot their legal responsibility for my stolen crypto assets as well as the risk that impacts other users of the wallet. In fact, Coinomis team discreetly deleted their reply to my tweets to hide the evidence regarding their unsigned main executable in which they confirmed the issue and they didnt respond to my requests as shown in the following screenshots: [URL &amp;#x200B; Such behavior was a clear evidence for me that there is something suspicious about their wallet and they didnt want to expose it. It seems the founders are the developers of the application and they dont like anyone who criticizes their ugly baby creation Coinomi wallet. They think that they are the code gurus fallen from the heavens who write perfect code. However, before I published my findings I sent them the whole thing giving them more than 12 hours heads-up because they requested a clear technical evidence. Their CTO told me that he will download the report within 3 hours (they downloaded the report after 5-6 hours). Imagine someone tells you that you have a CRITICAL vulnerability in your software which holds users' hard earned crypto assets and yet you act carelessly because somehow you think you are a superior creature (*Khan from Star Trek Into Darkness movie*). Below are the screenshots of the private messages between Coinomis CTO and me: [URL &amp;#x200B; This is not their first time behaving this way especially when someone finds an issue with their application. Luke Childs previously published a security vulnerability/misconfiguration and their response was somehow similar: [URL [URL # Recap To recap the events for further investigation: * My first passphrase attempt was sent to [googleapis.com](URL through Coinomi wallet was on 14th February 2019 * Googles employee or whoever has control over the data that are sent to [googleapis.com](URL processed the data that had my passphrase and that was between 14th and 19th February 2019 * My crypto assets were stolen on 19th February 2019 starting around 3:30 am UTC and the transactions continued for 15 minutes. At the end 90% of the assets were gone and remaining assets were only left because these assets were supported by Exodus wallet but NOT Coinomi wallet (what a coincidence you say!) Please note that I took all the security precaution to keep my passphrase and wallet safe. I have a separate isolated virtual machine for it with Anti-Virus/Anti-Malware and firewall installed. I also had other wallets on the same virtual machine for years. Nothing was stolen except for the wallet which I recently used my passphrase in, which is Coinomi wallet! # What's Next I will start taking legal actions against the company behind Coinomi if they dont act and take the responsibility. The company is registered in UK as Coinomi LTD if anyone one has faced or facing similar case were you suddenly lost your crypto assets and you happen to have used Coinomi wallet. The funny thing is that they state on their website: *Most importantly, no Coinomi wallet has ever been hacked or otherwise compromised to date.* (bull\*\*\*\*!) Be aware that probably all desktop versions are affected (Im not sure about the mobile versions) and the guy/group who is/are capturing the passphrases, possibly targeting only wallets with decent amount of assets to stay low profile as long as he/they can. I have also uploaded copy of the latest version of Coinomi application in case they take down the links to hide the facts: * [Download UNSIGNED version (proof that the main application was not signed)](URL * [Download signed version (proof that the wallet sends passphrase to a remote server)](URL * [Screenshot of the SHA256SUM hashes before the patch](URL # Final Thoughts This was an expensive and mentally painful experience to learn from and hopefully after publishing this post no one will experience the same. The lessons learned so far: * Never trust any multi-asset crypto wallet unless they have done an external security audit by a trusted third-party and their security audit is publicly available. * Never ever trust Coinomi with your hard earned crypto-currencies. They do not take any responsibility and when they f\*\*\*-up things they just run away like its not their business. * Never ever trust Google services/products with your sensitive information. They have great control over the data and it seems their policy isnt that strict which results in taking advantage and the power of the collected data by their employees especially who have malicious intents. At the end I need to make it clear again why I published this: * Spread awareness among users who are using or used Coinomi wallet. * Demand my stolen crypto-currency assets from the company behind Coinomi wallet either in terms of crypto currency or in terms of fiat currency. The more they procrastinate the more the value of the assets increase by time. * Force Google to start investigating the issue. Im pretty sure this is a serious issue not only in regards of my stolen crypto-currency assets but also in terms of users privacy and their data being maliciously used by Googles employees or whoever have control over these data. Finally I hope the moderators pin this post to spread awareness. Im pretty sure hundred thousands of crypto assets will be saved and many users will have the opportunity to save their hard earned crypto assets! **Next time if you need to spell check your passphrase/seed and to make sure that you are following the English dictionary just use Coinomi wallet LMAO!**"

To start off, CoinSplit is a way to automatically split Crypto transactions between friends and partners. I've used it for a couple of projects as a donation address. Automatically split between my two partners. Disclaimer, I'm not trying to get you to sign up and use CoinSplit. If you want to do so, cool. If not, also cool. Merely sharing a Blockchain project that has a real use case, and real users. From him, I've received the following data: CoinSplit has been in operation since 2013. In that time (at current prices) they've transacted 4700 BTC, close to 20m USD. This has taken place across 93000 transactions, resulting in an average transaction value of $200. With 1200 active users, the average user has transacted $15000. Although CoinSplit doesn't collect KYC/AML data, with this large of an average transfer value, we can conclude that the average CoinSplit user is a business, rather than a single person. Unfortunately, a hacker exploited a vulnerability in CoinSplit, and made off with 4 BTC. As unfortunate as this is, CoinSplit covered the losses from their own funds. To me, this is admirable for such a small service to do so. CoinSplit supports BTC, LTC, Doge, Dash and ZCash. If you had any requests, I'm sure Ivan would consider adding them if there was enough demand. My use case is splitting some payments we get from our Dash masternode. I set this up with a few buddies, we use coinsplit to keep it fair. I don't have confirmation from Ivan but I believe this is the most popular use case. Thanks for reading! I'm curious to see some discussion in the comments about blockchain projects (maybe dapps) that have real users. There is a lot of vaporware in Blockchain, but among that are some real projects.

We are working with an editor on documents such as the White Paper and Mathematical Plan. We wish to publish all of our documents to the public simultaneously and ensure the writing is of optimal quality. - Economy of Trust   We continue to enrich our project with various documents and reports. In order to share our understanding, I invite you to consult the next few paragraphs which present the economy of trust in today's world. Defining Trust in the Modern World  Trust, in a traditional sense, has functioned as the solution to managing risk in interpersonal economic relationships from the earliest days of modern society. Characterized as a difficult-to-define aggregate of social capital and the history of individual transactions and interactions in a society, trust has traditionally remained a relatively intangible element of any economy, reliant upon authority for enforcement. In modern society, opaque interpersonal relationships and a lack of familiarity between individuals, compounded by distance, make traditional trust models less effective. Trust is defined as a state or precondition wherein a person has a belief in the reliability, truth or ability of someone or something to undertake or perform a given task or objective. Trust, therefore, incorporates elements of vulnerability, risk, expectation, and uncertainty. The reputation systems that exist within the current digital economy, which largely manifest in the form of star-based rating systems, do not provide sufficient insight into the identify, behaviors and potential future actions of any given individual. Operating as simple rating mechanisms, contemporary reputation systems rely heavily on the honesty and active participation of stakeholders. In addition to their dependence on user honesty, reputation systems are also susceptible to manipulation. Fraudulent sellers or buyers frequently orchestrate fake reviews or ratings in reputation-based economic systems, disrupting the accuracy of reputation models and eroding user trust in the target platform. A New System of Trust  In order to adapt to the rapidly evolving digital economy, a new model of trust must be created that takes into account the various layers of the qualities of trust. We believe that such a system should have the following characteristics: A trust relationship between two persons or entities should take into account the historical and current trust status of both parties. Individuals or parties should be able to conduct a transaction or interaction with another party without sharing all of their private information. Trust systems must manage privacy in a manner that facilitates trust without compromising privacy. A trust system must incorporate a presupposition of risk by reflecting the amount of risk undertaken in the transaction between two persons or entities that are not known to one another. The expectation that one party will not take advantage of the trust given by another party must be enforced by the risk of incurring a penalty. Penalties enforced by the system may be executed in reputation or economic form. - Request for Presentation  Following our victory at Blockshow Asia last November, we were contacted by some events with requests to present our project at pitch conferences, with the aim of presenting the TustUnion project to future investors in several countries. We are working on the pitch presentation for the project so we can introduce our concept to the public and capture the attention of a new community. Thank you for your attention, and wish you a pleasant day. "

I woke up early in the morning my local time. Right away I turned on the laptop and checked my inbox where I discovered the abnormally large volume of letters from the COSS Exchange. There were a few thousands of them. Each letter informed me about a failed attempt to enter my account on the Exchange. [URL [URL All the security measures were taken properly: [URL I received all of the e-mails when I slept. I rushed to check the account and discovered that all my holdings were gone. More specifically, they were sold on low-liquid markets at the rates substantially lower than the market ones. [URL In no time I turned to the support of the Exchange and informed about the incident. I wrote about this situation on Reddit and in the public Telegram group of the Exchange. Naturally, the first reaction that I experienced from the community was humiliation and accusations of stupidity. Many called me a dumb fool because I stored funds on the Exchange and so on. No need to point out how I kept the funds. I have what I have now. So on a weekly basis, the Exchange shares the trading fees with the holders of its tokens. The profit is distributed among token holders proportionally to the number of tokens they possess. That's why I decided to keep my tokens with COSS exchange. The exchange claims: [URL [URL They forgot to mention one small fact that access to my account was received using vulnerability which allowed hacker to perform brute force attack on my 2FA.

The Exchange claims that the hacker had my password. Of course, the most natural and the easiest thing is to accuse the user of being responsible for the accident. But I can assure you that it is far from being the case. I have been in this industry since the end of 2011, and I do know how to generate and store wallets, passwords etc. I neither use Android smartphones, nor computers with Windows OS. I do not use SMS 2FA. I am meticulous and do not do bullshit. What if it was some internal job? Or users data base leaked?

However, I had a 2FA verification installed for this occasion. [URL It was designed exactly for the situations like the one I described above. 2FA enables to keep the funds safe even if the password/login was compromised.

[URL If I had additional time, I would manage to respond and prevent the hack. Even if there was my fault, but only 50%, the other half is that exchange gave the opportunity to the hacker to brute force 2FA.

Basically, the whole industry would become a mess. If the case, exchanges/platforms would suffer multi-billion dollar losses, in particular, translating into even more significant losses for the industry as a whole. No matter what decision COSS exchange will take I call other exchanges to add an extra security feature to protect users funds. TRADING PASSWORD.

That is strictly against Reddit's policies, and ours. ) &amp;#x200B; Oyster Update All, Earlier today, it was discovered that the transferDirector function was utilized on the Oyster Protocol token contract. This allowed the new director to re-open the ICO for PRL and re-issue new tokens (1 ETH = 5000 PRL / .04 per PRL). The individual in question then sent these tokens (upwards of 3M PRL) to KuCoin where the tokens were market sold. They were able to extract \~$300,000 in funds prior to us being able to shut down trading and withdrawals on KuCoin. Despite Oyster passing three separate smart contract audits, we were told by Bruno Block, the original founder and chief architect of the project, that the directorship of the token contract had to remain open so that the peg could be adjusted over time. This ultimately turned out to be a trapdoor mechanism in the contract that was eventually exploited. This contract was written by Bruno Block prior to the ICO, at which point Bruno was the only member of the team. We relied on the auditors involved here for assurance that the smart contract was safe. Bruno was the only one who had the ability to transfer directorship within the PRL smart contract. **After our initial review, we are inclined to believe that these were solely the actions of Bruno Block and that he did this now to avoid detection from KuCoin KYC procedures (that will be implemented on November 1st)**. These KYC procedures would have limited withdrawals on Non-KYCed accounts to no more than 2 BTC per day and would have prevented this from happening. This was well-orchestrated and well-executed (at a time when he knew a majority of the KC team would be offline). This also caught the entire team outside of Bruno Block by surprise, as the team collectively holds \~5% of the total supply in personal wallets. The team has been working tirelessly on this since day 1, without pay at some points in time. This project has been built on the back of hard work and raw determination and we will not let Brunos role as a bad actor in all of this undermine a project that the entire rest of the team is completely devoted to. For those of you holding PRL, **your PRL holdings are safe**. We are still evaluating our options, but will most likely be executing a contract swap on the block just prior to this all happening (e.g. All 98.5 million PRL prior to the contract vulnerability will be exchanged on a 1:1 ratio to PEARL (or something to that effect)). We will also be evaluating how we can help those that were taken advantage of from this incident. More details to come here but we will do our best to make everyone whole. Despite the losses, $300k only represents \~1.5% of our market cap prior to this all transpiring. While this is far from ideal, this will most definitely not be a deathknell for the project. So where do we go from here? We are continuing to investigate this but could use your help along the way. Here are the withdrawal addresses that Bruno withdrew the funds he sold on KuCoin to: **ETH:** [0x0001Ee57Bb28415742248d946D35C7f87cfd5A54](URL **BTC:** [17pwqhD9dLGMcMZD9xvKxiePHNffHV5T6y](URL In the interim, our team will be working around the clock to remedy this situation. We dont know why Bruno did what he did or what his intentions were at the end of the day, outside of profiting from a loophole that he intentionally left in the smart contract. While I still take full responsibility for this all transpiring, I had no reason to believe Bruno would do something like this to harm the project and much of the work that he had a significant role in creating. We will not let his selfish actions today damage the long-term viability of the project. \- [William Cordes](URL CEO of Oyster "
61,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,FunFair has a vulnerability which is even worse than Oyster!,1,9vgesp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9vgesp/funfair_has_a_vulnerability_which_is_even_worse/,2018-11-09 13:10:47,"Few days back the Oyster exit scam happened because the developers had failed to close the possibility to re-open minting of Oyster tokens for a certain price. An anonymous developer took advantage of this and re-opened the Oyster ICO, bought a lot of Oyster for the ICO price and then dumped them all via a market sell on Kucoin. FunFair is susceptible to the same level - but this is even WORSE! * FunFair can currently STEAL your tokens from your wallet * FunFair can MINT infinitely many tokens! Let's take a look why this is possible. Let me stress that this is all fixable, but right now FunFair is *NOT* trustless. You need to trust that a single wallet - we don't know who has this private key (does one person have it, or do multiple people of the company have access to it who can pull of this attack?) - does not do something funny and dump YOUR coins on Binance! [This is the FunFair contract](URL The contract is called ""Token"" so in the etherscan source code we find the contract ""Token"" and take a look what's in there. function transfer(address _to, uint _value) onlyPayloadSize(2) returns (bool success) { success = controller.transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); if (success) { Transfer(msg.sender, _to, _value); } } This is the transfer function which you use to transfer tokens to anyone (like Binance, or Binance transfers to you). What is funny is that this actually calls into `controller` which is ANOTHER contract! This means that the actual transfers are done via another contract! The ""owner"" can set the controller address: function setController(address _c) onlyOwner notFinalized { controller = Controller(_c); } But only when the `finalized` property is set to false. When it is finalized this property cannot be set to true. What is the setting of this now? Well, if we `Read Contract` on etherscan we see that `finalized` is false which means that the owner ([0xb2e4f9c3ca031894a96197de724f05786a00dbf1](URL can set the controller to anything! Note that this is a normal address, not a multisignature address which would need multiple owners to sign off a transaction. Everyone with this private key can reset the controller! And what can they do? Well, we already know they can transfer tokens with NO arbitrary check. Even the `balanceOf`, the ERC20 function to check the balance of an address, calls into `controller`: function balanceOf(address a) constant returns (uint) { return controller.balanceOf(a); } This basically means that you can create a controller which can return any amount of tokens for a certain address! In fact, if you reset the controller you can create an account with an arbitrary amount of tokens, **even more than the circulating supply!** Let's take a look at the [controller](URL which calls into this [Ledger](URL contract. This Ledger contract is the core of FunFair currently and this contract actually holds your balance! Now what is funny is this function: function transfer(address _from, address _to, uint _value) onlyController returns (bool success) { if (balanceOf[_from] &lt; _value) return false; balanceOf[_from] = safeSub(balanceOf[_from], _value); balanceOf[_to] = safeAdd(balanceOf[_to], _value); return true; } As you can see, the `controller` here can just supply a `from` address and a `to` address. If the `from` address has enough tokens they can just transfer these tokens! This means that if the `Controller` contract wants to take all tokens from Binance, they can just do so (probably by resetting the controller contract to a malicious one). Or, what they can also do is just erase all connections to this `Ledger` contract and create a new one where one address (the attacking address) has one trillion Fun tokens! This can all be prevented by: * Finalizing the FunFair contract * Verifying the Controller code which the FunFair contract is tied to But, right now, your Fun funds are not safe! It only takes one person who has access to the `owner` account to pull an Oyster and steal all your FUN. Also realize that if you are playing in one of their casino's the funds you get from them are NOT final at this moment!"

The guy who posted the question in Discord yesterday evening is a former lead developer of Zethr, a casino exit scam.

Block one mitigated this by claiming they would offer to fund free accounts, but this is not a viable option in the long term - how many accounts could they potentially fund themselves for free in the long run? Accounts could potentially cost as much as $100 to open in the future. One of the key selling points of EOS was the governance, they had a centralised model comprised of a constitution, and a keeper of the constitution who could potentially roll back malicious transactions by ""ordering"" the 21 block producers to return the funds. This approach already had its day in the sun when they decided early on to ""lock"" 7 accounts from making transaction, but due to the non co-operation of the BPs, the hackers were able to steal the money anyway. (related to point no 5 above) Now evidently with all these hacks appearing in a series, this model of governance is not working at all.

Therefore it is much more costly to scale up mining operations than it is currently with GPU minable algorithms. Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) manufaturing has become a very large industry to mine cryptocurrencies in recent years. While these machines perform much more efficiently than consumer grade hardware, they bring their own set of risks to a currency. The largest of these risks is centralization of hashrate and the potential for using that large hashrate as an attack vector on blockchain integrity. The primary purpose of the blockchain is to provide a decentralized record of transactions for a currency. When computational power is concentrated in a small number of miners, it becomes possible to manipulate the blockchain to steal coins, reverse transactions or with malicious intentions, destroy a cryptocurrency completely. However for all the damage these machines can do in malicious hands, they have one distinct vulnerability. They are designed at a hardware level to only mine a single algorithm. If a cryptocurrency changes their POW algorithm, the ASIC becomes useless. Typically, crypto developers have circumvented ASICs by way of a hardfork; A periodic update to the network that incorporates new developments in the code and a POW algorithm change. This has been done recently with most cryptonote based coins. This has two side effects. Firstly it breaks support for GPU miners and the software developers must update miner code to allow GPU's to mine the currency. This creates disruption to the network as miners have to update their software or wait for updates to be able to resume mining operations. The proposed cryptonote adaptive algorithm aims to remedy these issues. The algorithm changes dynamically each block. This means that no ASIC can ever be produced to mine NERVA (XNV) and it becomes exceedingly difficult to create GPU based mining software to mine NERVA (XNV). Since ASICs and GPUs can not mine the coin, it also becomes an unattractive option for mining rental services such as NiceHash."
66,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin DoS Vulnerability Explained in Full,6,9h2339,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9h2339/bitcoin_dos_vulnerability_explained_in_full/,2018-09-19 14:27:58,"Bitcoin Denial of Service Vulnerability Found in Core Code (Patched) Today, on September, 18th, 2018, there was a vulnerability in the Bitcoin client (specifically versions 0.14.0 and 0.16.2) that were identified by an anonymous reporter via [Bitcoin Cores main repository.](URL There has [since been a fix](URL that was released formally by [Pierre Rochard,](URL a developer (?) on the Core team. According to the documentation of the fix, posted in the GitHub cited above, &gt; A denial-of-service vulnerability (CVE-201817144) exploitable by miners has been discovered in Bitcoin Core versions 0.14.0 up to 0.16.2. It is recommended to upgrade any of the vulnerable versions to 0.16.3 as soon as possible. # Description of the Issue The issue, which was exposed to a greater audience via a Reddit post, appears be borne from a flaw in the compilation of transaction data on the protocol. Specifically, [this mailchimp newsletter,](URL referenced in the Pierre Rochard pull request, covers the issue in greater depth. **_In the newsletter, it states:_** &gt;  **Upgrade to Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 to fix denial-of-service vulnerability:** a bug introduced in Bitcoin Core 0.14.0 and affecting all subsequent versions through to 0.16.2 will cause Bitcoin Core to crash when attempting to validate a block containing a transaction that attempts to spend the same input twice. Such blocks would be invalid and so can only be created by miners willing to lose the allowed income from having created a block (at least 12.5 XBT or $80,000 USD). Herein lies the vulnerability, as described above. While it may seem insignificant at face value, it could actually cause considerable issues on the network. Before explaining some of the issues that it could cause, its best to first make sure that were caught up to speed on what a Denial of Service attack is and what it means in the context of blockchain, specifically Bitcoin. # What is a Denial of Service Attack? According to us-cert.gov, &gt;  A denial-of-service (DoS) attack occurs when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor. Services affected may include email, websites, online accounts (e.g., banking), or other services that rely on the affected computer or network. A denial-of-service is accomplished by flooding the targeted host or network with traffic until the target cannot respond or simply crashes, preventing access for legitimate users. DoS attacks can cost an organization both time and money while their resources and services are inaccessible. Whats stated above is a bit of a mouthful, but it does accurately describe what a Denial of Service tends to be. Now, in the context of blockchain, since it is a decentralized protocol, a denial of service attack is not the exact equivalent in this case (typically, it renders a network inaccessible), but the fundamental principle is the same. # One of Satoshis Main Concerns was Preventing DoS Attacks on Bitcoin In order to assess the impact of a DoS attack on Bitcoin, we need not look any further than at the forum posts [posted by Satoshi Nakamoto himself.](URL [**_Where is the separate discussion devoted to possible Bitcoin weaknesses._** Where is the separate discussion devoted to possible Bitcoin weaknesses.bitcointalk.org](URL ""URL In the conversation cited above, Satoshi admitted that he/she/they were musing the possibility of adding a PoW operation to transactions in order to ensure their validity and prevent a DoS attack via a flood of inaccurate transactions. The greater alternative that was decided upon by Satoshi was to just create a fee market while giving miners the option to only mine transactions that contained the greatest fees. The logic behind this decision was that, if the mempool became clogged with illicit/fraudulent transactions, then users would be able to bid with other users to have their transactions mined by applying a fee to the network (which miners would receive for successfully mining a block that included said transactions). By doing so, Satoshi reasoned that this would undermine a DoS attack by simply allowing the legitimate actors (on the user-facing end) to get their transactions confirmed without delay by simply offering a higher fee to the miners for mining their transaction. In such a situation, an attacker would need to outbid the majority of legitimate actors on the protocol in order to ensure that they accomplished their mission, because their transactions would be reviewed first before the others, thus creating a lull in the chain. ## Assessing Satoshis Fee Model Method for Preventing DoS Attacks While Satoshis method of preventing DoS attacks is not bullet proof and there were tertiary consequences to its implementation that were not felt until years later (i.e., the 1 MB block limit being hit, resulting in an excess amount of TXs in the mempool, which spiked the fee rate on the protocol exponentially), it still proves to be the most effective and least invasive means of preventing a DoS attack. And, the core philosophy (pun intended), mirrors Satoshis to the extent that security has been considered paramount to the efficiency of the chain itself. **_Here are some of the implementations of DoS-prevention measures on Bitcoin:_** ![](URL ![](URL Source: [URL # Potential Threats in the [Patched] DoS Susceptibility in Older Bitcoin Client Versions (0.16.2 &amp; 0.14) Based on what we know, the obvious threat comes from the fact that invalid transactions being mined would result in the failure of nodes on the above listed clients. This means that the attack vector inherent in this incident would stem from a miner mining an invalid block purposefully, which would be a waste of the resources that are necessary to fulfill the Proof of Work as well as the forfeited block reward (12.5 BTC at the time of writing). However, they would succeed in knocking out a number of nodes on the network, which could then open the network up to more nefarious attacks. A full node is not necessary for mining, but it is rare that any mining operations would be running on the protocol without one, since it is helpful to know when a block has been propagated to the network. It is also not entirely uncommon that an incorrect block could be propagated to the network. # Conclusion After review of the issue and the subsequent fix, it appears that the issue itself is under control. As to how the issue itself manifested in the code of Bitcoin Core is a question that remains unanswered at this point in time, but the important thing for Bitcoin users is that it has been fixed. Again, more information can be found in the links posted throughout this piece."

The very first bitcoin client was released on the 9th of January and SourceForge hosted it. On the 12th of January, Hal Finney, one of the first adopters took part in the worlds first peer-to-peer transaction. He received 10 bitcoins from Nakamoto. Since then, it hasnt been a rollercoaster ride. Bitcoin has had its good, bad, and ugly times. One of the best periods for Bitcoins is undoubtedly 2017; when the price skyrocketed from $1000 to over $20,000 in twelve months. But apart from this, the currency has also experienced several high points, as well as low ones. The aim of this post is to look back in time, take you through the different phases of Bitcoins and the crypto market, and see how one currency was able to disrupt the entire financial institution. URL **2010** About a million Bitcoins were mined during this time, and the official value of the currency was a topic of discussion among members of the Bitcoin Foundation, the community in charge of the currency. This was the time when about 10,000 BTC was used to purchase 2 pizzas from Papa Johns. In August, there was a serious vulnerability that was identified in the protocol which caused transactions not to be properly verified. This resulted in the generation of 184 million Bitcoins. But soon, the addresses where the funds were sent to were discovered and the error was reversed. **2011** Up till now, Bitcoin remained the only notable cryptocurrency, but this stance wasnt held for long. Shortly after, new entrants arrived. Namecoin, GeistGeld, iXcoin, SolidCoin, and a number of others were created. As at October, there were 9 currencies in total. URL **2012** 2012 saw a number of platforms accepting the currency. According to BitPay, over 1000 merchants were accepting Bitcoins and this included popular platforms like WordPress and WikiLeaks. **2013** This was the year when people began to take that new currency serious. Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin-based payment processor, reported that they sold over $1 million worth of bitcoins in a month. At this time, one Bitcoin was selling for just $22. The success also brought about a few shady deals, with the US authorities seizing accounts associated with Mt. Gox. The US Drug Enforcement Administration also seized about 11.02 Bitcoins during this period. By December 2013, the number of cryptocurrencies had skyrocketed to 197, with 38 new coins emerging in December alone. **2014** 2014 was another year of crypto-explosion. More and more people became interested in Bitcoin. Microsoft accepted Bitcoin payments for Xbox games and Windows Software. Other companies like Dell, Newegg, and even Casinos were also accepting the currency. Although the price of 1 BTC was between 340 and 450, it caused even other currencies to emerge. By the end of the year, exactly 646 new currencies were in the market. Although only a handful of these currencies are still in circulation, their addition to the crypto market heralded prosperity and strengthened belief. **2015** Over 100,000 merchants were accepting Bitcoin payments at the time. Earlier in the year, Coinbase raised another $75 million as part of a Series C funding round. Without a doubt, this was a very good year for cryptocurrencies in general, although the number of new coins didnt demonstrate this fact. In fact, the number of cryptocurrencies didnt exceed 800. URL **2016** Cryptocurrencies were gradually becoming a mainstream form of payment and cross-border transaction now. The price hovered between $600 and $780, but this was the period when we had approximately 1000 existing cryptocurrencies. At this time, Ethereum was also emerging as a force to be reckoned with in the crypto sphere and the smart contract platform was particularly taking off. **2017** Some people remember this period as the year of the rise of the cryptos. Bitcoin increased in value by almost 200%, from $1,000 in January to $20,000 in December. By December, the number of official cryptocurrencies in the market totaled 1,341. Although there were several other currencies that werent recognized. This era saw many early investors become billionaires, with several new ones emerging. **2018** Were still in it, right? So it is possible that we experience a miracle. But as it stands, Bitcoin has crumbled, merely peaking at $11,000 for months now. The average value of the currency is close to $6,000 and experts say theres no certain prediction about the future. As of April 10, 2018, there are over 1565 currencies and it is still growing. We can only watch and see how the next year unfolds. **How Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Has Changed the Landscape- ICOs** An ICO or Initial Coin Offering is a method of sourcing for funds via cryptocurrencies, especially for blockchain-related startups. This method is similar to an IPO (Initial Public Offering) where the shares of a particular company are sold to the investors. In an ICO, the company provides tokens which the public can purchase. If the venture pans out, the owners of the token enjoy the increased values of the tokens they have. Companies like Grid+ and Ethereum raised a significant amount of money via token sale and it is becoming increasingly popular in this tech world. Although the same drawback to using cryptos affects ICOs; they are not regulated. Hence, investors are always advised to invest with caution. *Processing img c6v0gcwd57g11...* If we compare Bitcoins growth to that of the internet, we can say that theres hope. Considering that Bitcoin just emerged about 9 years ago, and the internet has been around for decades, we have reason to think that the crypto market can replicate the performance in a better time. But then, remember that the market is heavily volatile! This makes it very difficult to accurately predict how itll fare. Kindly remember that you are not to take this as financial advice. URL"

78,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Did the Iota foundation commit fraud,0,9blm0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9blm0s/did_the_iota_foundation_commit_fraud/,2018-08-31 03:22:04,"In early October 2017, the iota foundation froze over 1,000 iota accounts over a vulnerability to brute force hacks. I was one of the people who had his account frozen. Im not an especially technical person, but my understanding of the vulnerability is this: When you create an iota seed, it has 81 characters. There are a total of 27 possible characters for each individual character. Therefore, to accurately brute force a wallet, you would need to guess on average 27 to the power of 81 times, which is a huge number. The issue is that for whatever reason when you send an iota transaction you broadcast half of this seed somehow (I dont understand how this works and one of you can probably do a better job of explaining it). The end result, as I understand it, is that the amount of computing to brute force a seed is halved each time a transaction is broadcast. So, if you send one transaction from an iota wallet, that seed can now be brute forced with roughly 27 to the power of 40. Still a massive number. In my case, I watched a video on YouTube, thought IOTA sounded interesting, bought some from a friend who was in another country (it was only listed on bitfinex at the time, and I didnt have access.) I sent him a little bit of iota back as a tip and he said naw, I dont need your stupid tip and sent it back. It seemed like a normal crypto experience and I figured my coins were reasonably safe in what felt like a desktop wallet and I didnt think about it. 3 months passed and iota went on a crazy pump to roughly $5 and I was up thousands of dollars. I looked at my portfolio and decided to sell it. I logged in with my seed and began a long and shitty process. I couldnt see my balance. I read that I should try to reattach 100+ times to get it to reappear (due to tangle pruning). I did so, but only recovered a few miotas out of about 1.5k (the worthless tip that I sent my friend). Then I learned about the reclaim process. I learned that my account was frozen. I tried to complete it but I couldnt get a transaction through. The network was basically collapsed under spam and only full nodes could process transactions. I wasted a full day trying to figure this out and finally gave up and decided to wait. I was working 60 hour weeks at my day job and didnt have time to fix this. I missed my opportunity to sell. Months passed and I tried again. I couldnt get a transaction through. I figured that my laptop was shit, so I bought a desktop for the purpose of processing this reclaim transaction and for other crypto purposes. I still couldnt get a transaction to confirm. Baffled, I said fuck it and gave up for a few more months. Finally I discovered that there was a website to make these transactions actually process. In June or July, with the help of a community member (not the Iota Foundation who seized my money), I was able to get my reclaim transactions submitted. Since then, I have been waiting. It has been almost a year since I bought my iota. I should have been able to sell my iota at $4-5, but wasnt able to because the iota foundation seized my funds, along with those of many other investors who also could have sold at a high price. Heres where the question of fraud comes in. Did Foundation insiders sell during this period of restricted supply? I dont have access to the full tangle to try to find their addresses due to the nature of how the tangle is pruned. That information is stored by the foundation. I have asked foundation members if they were selling during this period, and have received no reply. Those of us who lost money because of this reclaim debacle deserve to be made whole. If the foundation cannot do this, it should disbanded. This potential fraud needs to be investigated. If you lost money in the iota reclaim debacle, please contact me through pm or comment below. If theres enough of us, maybe we can get some answers. Thank you. "

They do this to prevent other contracts from being able to generate the random number ahead of time to decide if they should buy in at that moment to win the ""random"" airdrop, which returns free ETH.

Apartment on credit, car on credit, household appliances ... the list can go on forever. Entrepreneurs actively use borrowed funds as capital to start and develop their business. What can we say about the everyday use of loans, when the economy of whole countries is held with credit funds. Every year, the volume of lending is growing. Loans are becoming more affordable. Nevertheless, the modern credit system, despite all its relevance, has significant shortcomings. What are the disadvantages in the modern banking credit system? First, monopolism and centralization of power in the hands of the state and large banks, which dictate their conditions in the market of credit services. And we do not have another real safe alternative, unfortunately. Secondly, the cost of loans. High interest rates on loans and their uncontrolled growth at the discretion of major players. Thirdly, low profitability on bank deposits. Fourthly, the bureaucracy and the complexity of borrowing procedures, from collecting documents to formalizing a loan agreement and already the process of its execution. The procedure for collecting and verifying documents takes a lot of time and effort. Fifth, the hostility of the system to the consumer services. The system of checking borrowers is inefficient and often leads to mistakes in making decisions on the issue of a loan or refusal. This all entails financial losses for both the banks themselves and their conscientious customers, as the bank, by raising interest and other fees, is trying to compensate for its losses. Sixthly, a complete lack of transparency in the actions of financial institutions. Seventh, vulnerability to third parties personal data of borrowers, which are stored on the servers of banks. An alternative solution for a cheaper, safer and more effective way of providing loans is the technology of blockchain. However, in order to create a full-fledged lending system for one blockchain, there are few, we need developed standards and infrastructure. So, meet! The company is on the scene Distributed Credit Chain! What is the Distributed Credit Chain? In general, the project is aimed at decentralization of the financial system as a whole, and in particular to solve existing problems of the credit sphere. Distributed Credit Chain is a decentralized credit platform that will allow you to make any type of loan with minimal time and money. The ecosystem will bring together borrowers and lenders from around the world. Regardless of where the borrower is located in the world, he will be able to obtain a loan from a credit organization of any country in the world that will offer him the most favorable conditions. We, living, for example, in Africa, can get a loan in the UK. To receive a loan, the customer must create his account on the site, providing the system with all the necessary personal data. For all operations and data on the platform, encryption will be used, at each stage of the process digital signature technology will be used, which will ensure the security of all operations and the credibility of the system. What positive changes will the project bring to the credit sphere? The main thing that Distributed Credit Chain will do is ensure decentralization of the entire credit system and its return to market mechanisms. The main advantages for borrowers are: the opportunity to get cheaper loans. Interest rates on loans will decrease, and the quality of financial services will improve. In conditions of competition, the user himself will be able to choose the most favorable and comfortable conditions for himself. the speed of acceptance of the credit decision will increase, since the entire credit history of the client and information about the transactions that have ever been committed will be kept on the detachment. This will ensure the accuracy and reliability of information with the ability to quickly access and analyze data. Plus, there is no need to provide additional information on paper.- cross-border lending regime; full protection and security of personal data; more efficient and transparent credit system based on the application of smart contracts. The project will benefit not only the borrowers, but also the credit organizations themselves. I see the following benefits: The project will create on its platform conditions for a healthy competition of credit institutions. The working conditions will be formed by the market, not by the monopolists. the platform erases the territorial boundaries between borrowers and creditors; reducing credit risks, reducing fraud, delinquency and non-repayment of loans. Within the system, all information about lending will be displayed on the blockchain and, thus, will be easily accessible and transparent. This will ensure a reliable credit history, which can not be faked. the availability of a common database, as well as the platform's capabilities for rapid analysis of each client, will significantly reduce labor costs and increase the efficiency of verification of each borrower; there is no need to contain a centralized server to store the entire credit history of customers. Obviously, the project will bring significant benefits to both parties. DCC and ICO TOKEN The platform is based on the Ethereum blockchain with DCC standard tokens ERC20. Tokens will act as a payment currency within the ecosystem. Interestingly, borrowers who returned credit on time will be rewarded with DCC tokens. At the end of May this year, the ICO was launched. Hard cap was achieved in just 20 minutes! The company collected almost $ 49 million. And this is in the context of a recession in the crypto currency market, when many teams can not even collect half of the software. All this shows the relevance of the product and its relevance to the market at the moment! Now tokens can be purchased on stock exchanges. They are already traded on Bibox, Kucoin, FCoin, DEx.Top, IDEX. In general, I believe that the project has a huge potential and in the future will be able to replace the outdated banking credit system with a modern effective solution for blockchain. WebSite: URL"

I think I've just realized why but I'm not totally sure. It seems like the only vulnerability with crypto is an attacker trying to double spend. They'd be a buyer and they would emit a legitimate transaction between them and a seller. Then, they'd have to instantly try and mine a new block themselves that doesn't include that transaction, hoping if it gets accepted, the original transaction is never recorded. The only have a ~10 minute window though, because if the original transaction is recorded with another block, other miners will start working off that other block including the transaction. So the chances of them successfully mining a new block without the transaction after the original transaction was emitted are so low that it'll likely never happen. Is that correct? If so, my follow up question is, what if by chance the attacker does successfully mine a new block without the transaction right away, before any other blocks are made (and after getting the goods/services from the seller). And then everyone else starts mining new blocks based off of that block without the transaction. Is the only solution for the seller to wait a long enough period before releasing the goods/services to know that the transaction was successfully recorded? Thanks in advance!"

Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL --- EDITS: 1. make dates unambiguous, make it clear that [5] disputes the benefits alleged by Core developers"

89,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,"DAOstack Project Review - Insights on Team, Value Proposition, SWOT Analysis and more",3,8nu17r,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8nu17r/daostack_project_review_insights_on_team_value/,2018-06-02 04:01:34,"DAOstack has been dubbed the Wordpress for DAOs. They aim to catalyze decentralized companies, funds, and markets to collaborate and take fast, innovative decisions at scale. # Let's decrypt DAOstack Use Case ## What Problem is DAOstack Addressing? The advent of blockchain has made it possible to create open, reliable, and decentralized systems, consequently leading to the creation of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). DAOs are open, decentralized, and self-organized networks coordinated by crypto-economic incentives and self-executing codes. Put differently, these networks are not controlled by any single individual or organization. In comparison with traditional governments, this seems like a quantum leap in the right direction. Coordination of large and even small groups in the bid to point them towards collective action is often based on traditional top-down hierarchy, as evident in the military, government, corporate organizations, and even families. And there&amp;#39;s no arguing the fact that it is easier to point the ship in a single direction when there is only one captain. Despite the obvious benefits of top-down hierarchies, they are fundamentally flawed because individuals can be subject to bad judgement, bias, or bad influence. Also, as in the case of corrupt governments, the interests of a few powerful individuals may supersede that of many less powerful individuals. This flaw in traditional systems and the idea of eliminating middlemen and bosses, as well as replacing centralized mechanisms with decentralized systems has made DAOs popular. The mere thought of having hundreds and even thousands of people working together to solve major world problems without any hierarchy of command seems promising. Decisions will be made through the wisdom of the crowd, and rewards are distributed based on the value contributed. Unfortunately, blockchain tech and DAOs are still in their infancy stages, and DAOs in particular still remain a largely abstract idea, because there are a handful of limited use cases. In addition to lack of widespread adoption, one of the biggest challenges of DAOs is inefficiency. As earlier referenced above, it is easier to move a ship in a single direction if there is only one captain. While decentralized applications may be giving everyone in the system a voice, decision-making processes will become susceptible to noise (_a situation where everyone is talking and trying to steer the ship in his own favor_). Such a scenario makes it difficult, if not impossible to reach consensus. Additionally, there is a programming barrier in the execution of Ethereum smart contracts. Developers and users need to be familiar with Solidity in other to execute smart contracts. This is arguably one of the barriers to widescale adoption and implementation of smart contracts. DAOstack aims to solve this problem that is bound to arise in DAOs, by building a decentralized governance system for these organizations. ## DAOstack Value Proposition In line with the inherent problem of DAOs, solving it would require a technology or system that tallies and manages collective attention. Questions like _who_ can make a proposal and _how_, need to be answered. Also, _which_ proposals out of the possibly numerous proposals should get the attention of voters? Who has the right to vote and what are the criteria towards deciding this  reputation or subject-matter credibility? Upon answering all of these questions, a critical aspect that should not be neglected is vulnerability to corruption. That is to say, decisions or voting power within these decentralized networks should not be easily bought or sold; everyone should be incentivized to work towards the greater good. DAOstack provides the framework for answering the questions and for the creation, governance, and interoperability of DApps, DAOs, and Web companies. With the framework, content creators, freelancers, and individuals with relevant skillset can cooperate in producing DApps. According the DAOstack architect, Matan Field, &amp;quot;The first principle of designing the DAO stack was not to build a specific protocol or a specific application, but rather to build the soil, the ground from which a whole ecosystem can grow and thrive.&amp;quot; With this in mind, DAOstack provides a sandbox for experimentation of different governance structures for DAOs. Each DAO can customize its own governance structure; add and remove certain elements, define agency functions, and specify what can and can&amp;#39;t be done. Additionally, DAOs have the ability to manage, maintain, and curate their own collective databases. One of the main components of DAOstack is its reputation scoring system. This allows for a fair decision-making structure in decentralized organizations. By integrating a reputation assignment system, DAOs can assign reputation scores, which are non-transferable to its members. In order to increase in ranking, members have to make positive contributions to the DAO. DAOstack is also working to remove the learning barrier present in using Ethereum&amp;#39;s native programming language, Solidity. Many developers are still illiterates in this regards because of the infancy of blockchain tech. DAOstack&amp;#39;s solution is a valuable service, as many developers who are keen to enter the industry can create decentralized applications using JavaScript. DAOstack&amp;#39;s technological stack comprises of: **Arc:** This is the base layer of the stack and comprises of a framework for governance. It is a library of smart contracts that can be modified, mixed, and matched to create, deploy, and operate governance protocols for any given DAO on the Ethereum blockchain. **Arc.js:** Arc.js is a JavaScript library which allows front-end developers to easily build apps on top of Arc without being familiar with Solidity. **DApps Layer:** DAOstack has envisioned individuals and developers building decentralized applications on their platform. **Alchemy:** Alchemy is the first browser DApp built on the stack. Its function is to enable interoperability between DAOs and other applications in the ecosystem. **Archives:** These are a set of public and shared registries gathered by the community to enhance interoperability and collaboration within the ecosystem. DAOstack is starting with 3 key registries; the Hive, Compendium, and Mosaic ## DAOstack Leadership Team DAOstack is made up of a decent and balanced team with experience spanning from entrepreneurship, to blockchain, and academic backgrounds. Currently, there are 7 members and two advisors, mostly based in Israel. The CEO and Architect is Matan Field who has a background in education, with a Ph.D in Theoretical and Mathematical Physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science. He has worked as a research fellow at the Technion-Israel Insitute of Technology. He also has a strong entrepreneurial and blockchain background, having co-founded La&amp;#39;Zooz (a decentralized collaborative transportation system) and Backfeed (a social OS for decentralized organizations). Adam Levi is the CTO of the organization. He has a Ph.D in Physics and has worked as a radar engineer at the Israel Defense Forces. On their team of advisors are Jordan Greenhall and Seth Taube. Greenhall is the co-founder and former CEO of DivX, and also has affiliations with Harvard law School and Backfeed. Taube on the other hand is the CEO of Sierra Income Corporation and Director of Medley Capital Corporation. ## DAOstack Target Market Considering the fact that blockchain tech is still at its infancy and it is expected that as more and more individuals and institutions adopt the tech, there will be a need for some structure in governance. DAOstack is positioning itself to tackle this need when it arises. It is expedient to note that some various blockchain projects are already integrating the services of DAOstack. Some worthy mentions on the list includes Sapien, Gnosis, Menlo, iAngels, and NfX. Competition in the marketplace is quite stiff. Aragon which as a market cap of $77 million is DAOstack&amp;#39;s direct competitor. Aragon already has a working product that allows the creation and management of organizations on the Ethereum blockchain. Other competitors include DigixDAO and Maker. ## DAOstack roadmap DAOstack already has a MVP  Alchemy on the Kovan Ethereum Testnet, which was released on Mainnet along with the crowd-sale. With regards to the entire stack, they have the full DAO stack architecture and the Arc framework for governance. Other upcoming milestones on their roadmap includes: - Genesis Release and Pilot Program in Q4 2018 - Release of a second version of Alchemy in Q1 2019 - Genuine Release in Q2 2019 - A third version of Alchemy in Q3 2019 - Generosity Release in Q4 2019 ## DAOstack SWOT Analysis **Strengths** - Active code development - Strong team and advisory board - Lucrative market - Effective token structure - Partnerships with other solid blockchain projects **Weaknesses** - Untested market - CEO Matan failed with Backfeed, a similar project **Opportunities** - DAOstack are at the forefront of solving the problem of decentralized governance. Pulling through will send them to the skies. **Threats** - Highly competitive landscape **Conclusion** In general, DAOstack is a promising and exciting project. They have been able to reach a remarkable stage in product development. As with most blockchain projects, competition is stiff in the marketplace. However, considering the fact that blockchain tech is still new, we can only but hope that the team pulls through. --- If you enjoyed this review, please share it and follow us to get notified when we publish new reviews. * **Follow us on Twitter =&gt; URL *This article was originally published on DigitalAssetDB =&gt; **URL "
90,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Uncloak: The Cybersecurity on the Blockchain,16,8q6th7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8q6th7/uncloak_the_cybersecurity_on_the_blockchain/,2018-06-11 14:45:37,"Most decentralized platforms pride themselves in the apparent security of the blockchains and their impervious nature to hacking. However, they do not give the same assurances to the exchanges and the clients that work with the blockchains, due to the centralized nature of these systems. sav.png Is it possible to provide blockchain based solutions to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities on computer systems? While many virus detection systems exist, there is little or no effort at all to use artificial intelligence and blockchains to provide a holistic security net for corporations. Uncloak is the exception, and we need to dissect just how they are going about this. **How IoT increases internet vulnerabilities** Are our computers secure? In fact, what are our computers now, and in the future? To understand how essential the security of our systems in the future is, we need to understand several things. The world is becoming one gigantic computer. This is being achieved by the power of the internet combined with the advanced capability to connect almost anything to the internet. Add decentralized systems to that too. We now have the emergence of smart cities, smart homes, etc. it is now possible for a car to tell a gate that it has arrived, and for the entrance to automatically open, only for the designated car. Beds are telling electric kettles, toasters and microwaves to start with the breakfast now that you are awake, and autonomous cars automatically leave the garage and park outside once you lock the front door to go to work. What can happen if all your devices are hacked? What if your car was driven off the road to a cliff by a cyber-criminal? Are there clear safeguards out there? **The Current Situation** The main problems with security currently in the cyber world are not viruses. They are hacking and ransomware. Most people believe that with updated anti-virus software, enough firewalls and proper intrusion detection software, they are safe from internet-based attacks. But hackers are crafty people. They have the same software, and they understand the architecture of threat identification and elimination. So they run rings around security providers and stay miles ahead in the new technology ridden field, costing the world trillions of shillings in data leaks, lost revenues and mitigation costs. And it is not only money that can be lost. Reputations are at stake too. Hackers have been known to infiltrate devices, acquire private photos or messages and propagate them where most damage will be caused. The damage can either be immediate or slow burn' due to customer drain and loss of personal or corporate image. **The Uncloak Solution** **Vulnerability Scanning** Uncloak will come with the ability to enable clients allow the system to automatically identify their internet footprint, including websites, devices, databases and any other internet data facilities. They will then scan the customer landscape for any threat that has been identified and mapped onto the blockchain, and where they are found, the community of white hat hackers, IT expertsand engineers will work with the client to identify the best remedial actions to take. This is vulnerability identification and not attack remediation. It allows the system actually to avert future attacks. **The Bug Bounty Element** Uncloak will operate with a blockchain-unique token called UCC, which shall be availed to users of the platform. The experts will perform an essential role in threat identification. Through assessing the clients systems and devices, the hunters will identify threats and broadcast them for validation. If validators confirm that there are no copies of the same threats on the blockchain, then the hunters will collect 10,000 UCC while the validators will each pocket 1,500 UCC. The UCC can be converted to tradable UNC tokens which can be sold for Eth on public exchanges. The hunters will also be motivated to identify remedies to deal with imminent attacks. **AI-based Threat detection engine** Now, this is where things get interesting. There is the internet we know, and then there are the black hat' abodes where evil lurks. It is known as the dark web, and this is where the trade between those who know of various system vulnerabilities and those who need it happen. In exchange for the untraceable cryptocurrency. What Uncloak will do is institute a listening system backed by their interaction with Krzana to build threat landscape reports and use them to occasion customer remedies. Once threats have been identified, clients will be notified to initiate measures to prevent attacks. **The Uncloak Roadmap** With the test MVP (Minimum Viable Product) already released and the token sale underway, the platform is now in the later stages of the documented roadmap. The main milestones that remain include their collaboration with Krzana and the launch of the community and strategic relationships. **Final Thoughts** So many technologies, devices and indeed, whole companies are now dependent on the internet and the ever increasing connectivity of devices. The security of systems and data used to control these devices is of utmost importance to protect both resources and reputations of their owners. Cybersecurity is not only achieved through the use of proper antivirus software but the capability of avoidance of hacking and such vices as ransomware. Uncloak has identified distinct technologies to achieve this. Through their vulnerability scanning, bug bounty and threat detection, they are capable of listening to the dark web and alerting clients who have vulnerabilities before attacks can happen. Their tech is unique in the sense that they will use existing ethical hackers and IT engineers to identify and notify clients of vulnerabilities before they happen. And they have a test-ready Minimum Viable product, their token is affordable, and their software is easy to use! Uncloak Sub-Reddit : URL Give your views in comments."

93,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Elastos ($ELA) Explained + List of Impressive Partnerships and dApps,69,8filld,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8filld/elastos_ela_explained_list_of_impressive/,2018-04-28 18:14:49,"**What is Elastos?** *BLOCKCHAIN POWERED INTERNET* Elastos is a blockchain based operating system which is the world's first open source Internet Operating System. The Elastos Foundation was founded by Rong Chen and Sunny Feng Han, aiming to create a new Internet system powered by blockchain technology. On this new Internet, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Elastos will be used as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application and has received sponsorship of over 200 million RMB from the Foxconn Group and other industry giants for its research and development. Elastos has open-sourced tens of millions of lines of source code, including more than four million lines of original source code. DApps are forced to never connect directly with the internet and only interact with the Elastos runtime (which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet) and youve essentially got a system thats 90% more secure than the way IoT or smart devices currently work. Today if I have 50 smart devices in my home, they all interact with the internet, I need to worry about 50 security threats. With Elastos, all I need to worry about is 1 threat, an attack on the Elastos runtime itself, this is a 10x better set-up and applies to IoT or frankly any device, with the beauty being its code written in C++ so any device can run it, even your fridge, and its open source, so any developer can make whatever DApps they want. **The Elastos Value Proposition** * There are three major value propositions to Elastos. First is consumer/enterprise IoT as the key Elastos feature is security. In essence, this is targeting the onboarding of infrastructure/industrial software. DApps here would really be non-interactive secure software behind smart devices, not something you and I would really interact with on a tablet for example but necessary to be secure if you want sustainable IoT per above. * Second is consumer DApps, i.e. B2C. This really takes advantage of the P2P network aspect of Elastos OS and user IDs on the blockchain, with the security being an added plus but not the prime driver per say. These DApps will have their own side chains/tokens for whatever utility they serve. Elastos has a number of DApps already building on the platform - Zapya is a good example on the consumer end for P2P file sharing with 500 million users. Elastos often talks about facilitating a real digital asset economy where scarcity and thus re-sale/trading of digital assets is possible (today if you buy a movie on the internet you cant resell it like you can in the real world, which Elastos thinks should be fixed). Again, a big market with essentially the whole eCommerce market as a target market, underpinned by the security of Elastos. * Third is enterprise DApps, i.e.B2B. Again this makes use of the P2P network, a good example here is ULink (China rentals) or the seed company Elastos has building DApps on it. Here the emphasis really is ability to track supply chain or information across the value chain and uses sidechains again. This market is large but this is where competitive advantage is weakest for Elastos as could use any blockchain for this purpose. **Brief Summary?** * Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger: Bitcoin introduced the power of decentralised ledger technology to the world, showing how we dont need financial institutions to transact value. Bitcoin's purpose is a digital currency, with the intent to become electronic cash. Bitcoin is great; however, it is extremely outdated. Bitcoin has very slow transaction times, expensive transaction fees and uses Proof of Work mining which is vastly uneconomical. Thanks to Bitcoin, the 2nd generation cryptocurrencies were born. * Ethereum = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts: Ethereum, as well as many others, are second generation cryptocurrencies. Ethereum was one of the first cryptocurrencies to introduce smart contracts and the concept of decentralised apps. Smart contracts put the trust of contracts in the trust of code. For example, If I bought a TV from an online merchant, the payment would only clear once the TV had arrived and I was satisfied with it. They can be coded to included things like 14-day money back guarantee and every other element that is in a normal contract. Drastically improving efficiency and breeds a new generation of trust. Ethereum is a great project, however the scalability of smart contracts that are hosted on the Ethereum network is limited. A game called CryptoKitties caused massive network congestion and that is just one of many decentralised applications that use smart contracts. * Elastos = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts + Monetizable Dapps and Digital Assets: Elastos is one of many new cryptocurrencies that are build on a third generation blockchain, focussing on a few main elements to combat the scalability issues that arise with 2nd generation cryptocurrencies: 1. Storage and Speed 2. Bugs within the Smart Contracts (security vulnerability). 3. Cost 4. Deletion of redundant data 5. Security The issue with second generation smart contracts is that they have to run solely on the blockchain, which causes network congestion and high transaction costs. Decentralized applications for Elastos are run by blockchain technology but can be built on current Operating Systems (IOS, Andriod and computer). Rong Chen understands the importance of ease of use for both the consumer and the producers. The integration of multiple well known coding languages make development relativity easier than other blockchains. They also support Android and Apple Operating Systems, which most other blockchains do not. Elastos is not just the new internet, but the entire smart economy. Focusing on digital assets, monetizing computing power and spare storage, financially incentive trade of digital assets all combined with the highest level of security and the removal of the middleman. With speed, security and minimal cost at the heart of Elastos, it is bound to scale over time. Elastos is a third generation blockchain technology that tackles the issues we have with second generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. **What is the business model for Elastos?** * Provide large blockchain applications with the secure running environment * Digital content remains intact after multiple uses * Big data and digital content can identify ownership on blockchain and correspond to tokens * Tokens can be transferred and traded legally on the blockchain, realizing future capital * Usage of tokens can consume/use digital content in Elastos Runtime. * Elastos can set a fixed limited amount for digital assets, thereby creating a scarcity of valued products **Development History(Tens of Millions of Open-Source Code spanning Decades)** * Rong Chen talks about Elastos' 17 years of history: URL * In 2000, Rong Chen, a senior alumnus of Tsinghua Universitys Computer Science department, returns to China from Microsoft USA and begins research and development for the first-generation Elastos network Operating System. * In 2003, Rong Chen was received by Jin-Tao Hu, the former CPC General Secretary. * In 2013, Foxconn makes investments in the Elastos Operating System open-source software project. * In 2017, Sunny Feng Han and Ji-Han Wu started running the Bitcoin Investment Elastos Blockchain Community and founded G3 with Bitmain and NEO. * In 2017, the Elastos Blockchain community received a global digital token investment worth 600 million RMB. **PARTNERSHIPS** * SAIC Motor: China's largest auto manufacturer.

94,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Elastos ($ELA) Explained + List of Partnerships and dApps,65,8fkhce,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8fkhce/elastos_ela_explained_list_of_partnerships_and/,2018-04-29 01:12:15,"**What is Elastos?** *BLOCKCHAIN POWERED INTERNET* Elastos is a blockchain based operating system which is the world's first open source Internet Operating System. The Elastos Foundation was founded by Rong Chen and Sunny Feng Han, aiming to create a new Internet system powered by blockchain technology. On this new Internet, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Elastos will be used as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application and has received sponsorship of over 200 million RMB from the Foxconn Group and other industry giants for its research and development. Elastos has open-sourced tens of millions of lines of source code, including more than four million lines of original source code. DApps are forced to never connect directly with the internet and only interact with the Elastos runtime (which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet) and youve essentially got a system thats 90% more secure than the way IoT or smart devices currently work. Today if I have 50 smart devices in my home, they all interact with the internet, I need to worry about 50 security threats. With Elastos, all I need to worry about is 1 threat, an attack on the Elastos runtime itself, this is a 10x better set-up and applies to IoT or frankly any device, with the beauty being its code written in C++ so any device can run it, even your fridge, and its open source, so any developer can make whatever DApps they want. **The Elastos Value Proposition** * There are three major value propositions to Elastos. First is consumer/enterprise IoT as the key Elastos feature is security. In essence, this is targeting the onboarding of infrastructure/industrial software. DApps here would really be non-interactive secure software behind smart devices, not something you and I would really interact with on a tablet for example but necessary to be secure if you want sustainable IoT per above. * Second is consumer DApps, i.e. B2C. This really takes advantage of the P2P network aspect of Elastos OS and user IDs on the blockchain, with the security being an added plus but not the prime driver per say. These DApps will have their own side chains/tokens for whatever utility they serve. Elastos has a number of DApps already building on the platform - Zapya is a good example on the consumer end for P2P file sharing with 500 million users. Elastos often talks about facilitating a real digital asset economy where scarcity and thus re-sale/trading of digital assets is possible (today if you buy a movie on the internet you cant resell it like you can in the real world, which Elastos thinks should be fixed). Again, a big market with essentially the whole eCommerce market as a target market, underpinned by the security of Elastos. * Third is enterprise DApps, i.e.B2B. Again this makes use of the P2P network, a good example here is ULink (China rentals) or the seed company Elastos has building DApps on it. Here the emphasis really is ability to track supply chain or information across the value chain and uses sidechains again. This market is large but this is where competitive advantage is weakest for Elastos as could use any blockchain for this purpose. **Brief Summary?** * Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger: Bitcoin introduced the power of decentralised ledger technology to the world, showing how we dont need financial institutions to transact value. Bitcoin's purpose is a digital currency, with the intent to become electronic cash. Bitcoin is great; however, it is extremely outdated. Bitcoin has very slow transaction times, expensive transaction fees and uses Proof of Work mining which is vastly uneconomical. Thanks to Bitcoin, the 2nd generation cryptocurrencies were born. * Ethereum = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts: Ethereum, as well as many others, are second generation cryptocurrencies. Ethereum was one of the first cryptocurrencies to introduce smart contracts and the concept of decentralised apps. Smart contracts put the trust of contracts in the trust of code. For example, If I bought a TV from an online merchant, the payment would only clear once the TV had arrived and I was satisfied with it. They can be coded to included things like 14-day money back guarantee and every other element that is in a normal contract. Drastically improving efficiency and breeds a new generation of trust. Ethereum is a great project, however the scalability of smart contracts that are hosted on the Ethereum network is limited. A game called CryptoKitties caused massive network congestion and that is just one of many decentralised applications that use smart contracts. * Elastos = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts + Monetizable Dapps and Digital Assets: Elastos is one of many new cryptocurrencies that are build on a third generation blockchain, focussing on a few main elements to combat the scalability issues that arise with 2nd generation cryptocurrencies: 1. Storage and Speed 2. Bugs within the Smart Contracts (security vulnerability). 3. Cost 4. Deletion of redundant data 5. Security The issue with second generation smart contracts is that they have to run solely on the blockchain, which causes network congestion and high transaction costs. Decentralized applications for Elastos are run by blockchain technology but can be built on current Operating Systems (IOS, Andriod and computer). Rong Chen understands the importance of ease of use for both the consumer and the producers. The integration of multiple well known coding languages make development relativity easier than other blockchains. They also support Android and Apple Operating Systems, which most other blockchains do not. Elastos is not just the new internet, but the entire smart economy. Focusing on digital assets, monetizing computing power and spare storage, financially incentive trade of digital assets all combined with the highest level of security and the removal of the middleman. With speed, security and minimal cost at the heart of Elastos, it is bound to scale over time.

With speed, security and minimal cost at the heart of Elastos, it is bound to scale over time. Elastos is a third generation blockchain technology that tackles the issues we have with second generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. **Development History(Tens of Millions of Open-Source Code spanning Decades)** * [Rong Chen talks about Elastos' 17 years of history: The most comprehensive Q&amp;A with Rong Chen about Elastos, his history, his success and failures and why he stuck with building a blockchain operating system](URL * In 2000, Rong Chen, a senior alumnus of Tsinghua Universitys Computer Science department, returns to China from Microsoft USA and begins research and development for the first-generation Elastos network Operating System. * In 2003, Rong Chen was received by Jin-Tao Hu, the former CPC General Secretary. * In 2013, Foxconn makes investments in the Elastos Operating System open-source software project. * In 2017, Sunny Feng Han and Ji-Han Wu started running the Bitcoin Investment Elastos Blockchain Community and founded G3 with Bitmain and NEO. * In 2017, the Elastos Blockchain community received a global digital token investment worth 600 million RMB. **What is the Elastos Blockchain structure?** [Diagram to how merge mining works with bitcoin and Elastos](URL [Diagram to how elastos blockchain looks like and how P2P network is implemented](URL [Diagram to how elastos carrier works](URL * Through the merged mining with Bitcoin, the safety and reliability are ensured by strong Bitcoin computing power through Proof of Work. This mining strategy saves resources and avoids repeated consumption. * Because Elastos structure is built by having a main chain and side chain, it avoids main chain being overloaded, and leads to easy routing and flexible extension, increasing the possibility for the Elastos to become basis for future internet applications. * The blockchain is a trust zone and a reliable internet database. Smart contracts are merely the saving process of this reliable database. Only the valuable data that needs to be notarized is recorded on the blockchain; only the data processing that needs computation reliability requires smart contracts. **What are Elastos mainchain and sidechains in elastos ecosystem?** One of the highlights of the design is that it makes use of a blend of mainchains and sidechains to improve the computational ability of blockchain technology. The mainchain only executes simple transactions and payment transfers while the sidechain handles smart contracts to support services and applications. With this structure scalability and security can be accomplished. Similar to the Operating System on a mobile device, users need a trustworthy location to store important data. The Elastos blockchain works as this trust zone for the entire network Operating System. The Elastos blockchain applies main and sidechain solutions to facilitate the smart economy and a healthy decentralized application environment. This means that every application can create individual sidechains. The Elastos blockchain provides built-in, complete, easy-to-use sidechain support. They will also be customizable, allowing clients to pick a different consensus method depending on the use case. Any system built with blockchain technology has less computing power than a traditional computer, and so will not be able to meet the various requirements of internet applications (such as video games or streaming a high-definition movie). This is a fundamental reason why blockchains still cannot be applied on the internet at a large scale. The Elastos team recognizes this fact, and therefore believes that blockchain development should not rely solely on the main chain for computation. Elastos aims to scale their blockchain system by providing support for sidechains, which will help meet requirements for running applications with high IOPS. The Elastos main chain will be responsible for the small but very important role of trading and transferring ELA, thus providing stability to the blockchain system. Elastos wants to avoid bloating the main chain with unnecessary smart contracts. Instead, only major infrastructure upgrades will take place on the main chain. All other smart contracts can be implemented on sidechains, enabling scalability. This kind of hierarchical and structured design philosophy will pave the way for a future blockchain paradigm, such as the aforementioned development from stand-alone computation to a distributed one. This is a key innovation in blockchain technology, and more important than the partial technology of singular consensus algorithms and chains. The team will implement basic services as sidechains for global and public use. These services include ID generation, token distribution, digital asset trading, and fast payment systems. These basic services, all important infrastructural components, are part of the Elastos Smart Web. In addition, the team will also provide support for third-party sidechain development. Transactions are the most important part of the interface between the main and sidechains. The transaction procedure for sending tokens from the main chain to a sidechain is equivalent to sending from a user account on the main chain to a multi-signature address corresponding to the sidechain. The process automatically checks that the sidechain can identify the transaction and deposit the equivalent value of sidechain tokens to the sidechain account. **What is the business model for Elastos?** * Provide large blockchain applications with the secure running environment * Digital content remains intact after multiple uses * Big data and digital content can identify ownership on blockchain and correspond to tokens * Tokens can be transferred and traded legally on the blockchain, realizing future capital * Usage of tokens can consume/use digital content in Elastos Runtime. * Elastos can set a fixed limited amount for digital assets, thereby creating a scarcity of valued products **Example of how the above works?** Current blockchain technology allows for the recording of property rights. But while users can prove that digital books belong to them, they cant necessarily prevent people from stealing or reading these books without permission. In such an environment, it is very difficult to monetize digital assets. Elastos aims to solve this problem by creating an environment in which the execution of a digital asset (i.e., the viewing, buying or selling of a digital movie) all take place on the Elastos Smart Web, and therefore abide by the rules of smart contracts. The creator of digital content can use a tool, provided by Elastos, to determine the number of digital assets to produce. Authors, for example, can decide that they only want to have 5000 copies of their books in circulation on the Smart Web. Setting a finite amount of digital content produces scarcity and enables the realization of capital. Elastos also wants to enable consumers to become investors. Say there are only 5000 digital books in circulation, and that these books become extremely popular. That means that every one of those books will increase in value, creating potential wealth for the people who bought them. After enjoying the book, the customer could sell it to someone else for a higher price. Users can also buy limited edition game apps. After playing those games in Elastos Runtime on their cell phones, they can sell the games to other people. Because these games are limited editions, their value will fluctuate on the second-hand market. In another use case, filmmakers could raise money for their movies by crowdfunding through issuing their tokens. The filmmakers could write a smart contract saying that every time someone watches the movie, token holders will get a small share of the fee. The filmmakers may also write another smart contract to let moviegoers sell the movie peer-to-peer or via social networks and receive commissions. This system creates financial opportunities for both creators and consumers, thus incentivizing more people to use Elastos. The accumulation of more users will incentivize more digital content creators to produce and publish content on the Elastos platform. This increase in content could then attract even more users, and those additional users will create more content. This is a positive cycle that will result in a large amount of valuable digital content that can be used to generate wealth."

Elastos is a blockchain based operating system which is the world's first open source Internet Operating System. The Elastos Foundation was founded by Rong Chen and Sunny Feng Han, aiming to create a new Internet system powered by blockchain technology. On this new Internet, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Elastos will be used as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application and has received sponsorship of over 200 million RMB from the Foxconn Group and other industry giants for its research and development. Elastos has open-sourced tens of millions of lines of source code, including more than four million lines of original source code. DApps are forced to never connect directly with the internet and only interact with the Elastos runtime (which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet) and youve essentially got a system thats 90% more secure than the way IoT or smart devices currently work. Today if I have 50 smart devices in my home, they all interact with the internet, I need to worry about 50 security threats. With Elastos, all I need to worry about is 1 threat, an attack on the Elastos runtime itself, this is a 10x better set-up and applies to IoT or frankly any device, with the beauty being its code written in C++ so any device can run it, even your fridge, and its open source, so any developer can make whatever DApps they want. The Elastos Value Proposition There are three major value propositions to Elastos. First is consumer/enterprise IoT as the key Elastos feature is security. In essence, this is targeting the onboarding of infrastructure/industrial software. DApps here would really be non-interactive secure software behind smart devices, not something you and I would really interact with on a tablet for example but necessary to be secure if you want sustainable IoT per above. Second is consumer DApps, i.e. B2C. This really takes advantage of the P2P network aspect of Elastos OS and user IDs on the blockchain, with the security being an added plus but not the prime driver per say. These DApps will have their own side chains/tokens for whatever utility they serve. Elastos has a number of DApps already building on the platform - Zapya is a good example on the consumer end for P2P file sharing with 500 million users. Elastos often talks about facilitating a real digital asset economy where scarcity and thus re-sale/trading of digital assets is possible (today if you buy a movie on the internet you cant resell it like you can in the real world, which Elastos thinks should be fixed). Again, a big market with essentially the whole eCommerce market as a target market, underpinned by the security of Elastos. Third is enterprise DApps, i.e.B2B. Again this makes use of the P2P network, a good example here is ULink (China rentals) or the seed company Elastos has building DApps on it. Here the emphasis really is ability to track supply chain or information across the value chain and uses sidechains again. This market is large but this is where competitive advantage is weakest for Elastos as could use any blockchain for this purpose. Brief Summary? Conversation with Su Yipeng, the Chief Architect of Elastos Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger: Bitcoin introduced the power of decentralised ledger technology to the world, showing how we dont need financial institutions to transact value. Bitcoin's purpose is a digital currency, with the intent to become electronic cash. Bitcoin is great; however, it is extremely outdated. Bitcoin has very slow transaction times, expensive transaction fees and uses Proof of Work mining which is vastly uneconomical. Thanks to Bitcoin, the 2nd generation cryptocurrencies were born. Ethereum = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts: Ethereum, as well as many others, are second generation cryptocurrencies. Ethereum was one of the first cryptocurrencies to introduce smart contracts and the concept of decentralised apps. Smart contracts put the trust of contracts in the trust of code. For example, If I bought a TV from an online merchant, the payment would only clear once the TV had arrived and I was satisfied with it. They can be coded to included things like 14-day money back guarantee and every other element that is in a normal contract. Drastically improving efficiency and breeds a new generation of trust. Ethereum is a great project, however the scalability of smart contracts that are hosted on the Ethereum network is limited. A game called CryptoKitties caused massive network congestion and that is just one of many decentralised applications that use smart contracts. Elastos = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts + Monetizable Dapps and Digital Assets: Elastos is one of many new cryptocurrencies that are build on a third generation blockchain, focussing on a few main elements to combat the scalability issues that arise with 2nd generation cryptocurrencies: Storage and Speed Bugs within the Smart Contracts (security vulnerability). Cost Deletion of redundant data Security The issue with second generation smart contracts is that they have to run solely on the blockchain, which causes network congestion and high transaction costs. Decentralized applications for Elastos are run by blockchain technology but can be built on current Operating Systems (IOS, Andriod and computer). Rong Chen understands the importance of ease of use for both the consumer and the producers. The integration of multiple well known coding languages make development relativity easier than other blockchains. They also support Android and Apple Operating Systems, which most other blockchains do not. Elastos is not just the new internet, but the entire smart economy. Focusing on digital assets, monetizing computing power and spare storage, financially incentive trade of digital assets all combined with the highest level of security and the removal of the middleman. With speed, security and minimal cost at the heart of Elastos, it is bound to scale over time. Elastos is a third generation blockchain technology that tackles the issues we have with second generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Development History(Tens of Millions of Open-Source Code spanning Decades) Rong Chen talks about Elastos' 17 years of history: The most comprehensive Q&amp;A with Rong Chen about Elastos, his history, his success and failures and why he stuck with building a blockchain operating system In 2000, Rong Chen, a senior alumnus of Tsinghua Universitys Computer Science department, returns to China from Microsoft USA and begins research and development for the first-generation Elastos network Operating System. In 2003, Rong Chen was received by Jin-Tao Hu, the former CPC General Secretary. In 2013, Foxconn makes investments in the Elastos Operating System open-source software project. In 2017, Sunny Feng Han and Ji-Han Wu started running the Bitcoin Investment Elastos Blockchain Community and founded G3 with Bitmain and NEO. In 2017, the Elastos Blockchain community received a global digital token investment worth 600 million RMB. What is the Elastos Blockchain structure? Diagram to how merge mining works with bitcoin and Elastos Diagram to how elastos blockchain looks like and how P2P network is implemented Diagram to how elastos carrier works Through the merged mining with Bitcoin, the safety and reliability are ensured by strong Bitcoin computing power through Proof of Work. This mining strategy saves resources and avoids repeated consumption. Because Elastos structure is built by having a main chain and side chain, it avoids main chain being overloaded, and leads to easy routing and flexible extension, increasing the possibility for the Elastos to become basis for future internet applications. The blockchain is a trust zone and a reliable internet database. Smart contracts are merely the saving process of this reliable database. Only the valuable data that needs to be notarized is recorded on the blockchain; only the data processing that needs computation reliability requires smart contracts. What are Elastos mainchain and sidechains in elastos ecosystem? One of the highlights of the design is that it makes use of a blend of mainchains and sidechains to improve the computational ability of blockchain technology. The mainchain only executes simple transactions and payment transfers while the sidechain handles smart contracts to support services and applications. With this structure scalability and security can be accomplished. Similar to the Operating System on a mobile device, users need a trustworthy location to store important data. The Elastos blockchain works as this trust zone for the entire network Operating System. The Elastos blockchain applies main and sidechain solutions to facilitate the smart economy and a healthy decentralized application environment. This means that every application can create individual sidechains. The Elastos blockchain provides built-in, complete, easy-to-use sidechain support. They will also be customizable, allowing clients to pick a different consensus method depending on the use case. Any system built with blockchain technology has less computing power than a traditional computer, and so will not be able to meet the various requirements of internet applications (such as video games or streaming a high-definition movie). This is a fundamental reason why blockchains still cannot be applied on the internet at a large scale. The Elastos team recognizes this fact, and therefore believes that blockchain development should not rely solely on the main chain for computation. Elastos aims to scale their blockchain system by providing support for sidechains, which will help meet requirements for running applications with high IOPS. The Elastos main chain will be responsible for the small but very important role of trading and transferring ELA, thus providing stability to the blockchain system. Elastos wants to avoid bloating the main chain with unnecessary smart contracts. Instead, only major infrastructure upgrades will take place on the main chain. All other smart contracts can be implemented on sidechains, enabling scalability. This kind of hierarchical and structured design philosophy will pave the way for a future blockchain paradigm, such as the aforementioned development from stand-alone computation to a distributed one. This is a key innovation in blockchain technology, and more important than the partial technology of singular consensus algorithms and chains. The team will implement basic services as sidechains for global and public use. These services include ID generation, token distribution, digital asset trading, and fast payment systems. These basic services, all important infrastructural components, are part of the Elastos Smart Web. In addition, the team will also provide support for third-party sidechain development. Transactions are the most important part of the interface between the main and sidechains. The transaction procedure for sending tokens from the main chain to a sidechain is equivalent to sending from a user account on the main chain to a multi-signature address corresponding to the sidechain. The process automatically checks that the sidechain can identify the transaction and deposit the equivalent value of sidechain tokens to the sidechain account. What is the business model for Elastos? Provide large blockchain applications with the secure running environment Digital content remains intact after multiple uses Big data and digital content can identify ownership on blockchain and correspond to tokens Tokens can be transferred and traded legally on the blockchain, realizing future capital Usage of tokens can consume/use digital content in Elastos Runtime. Elastos can set a fixed limited amount for digital assets, thereby creating a scarcity of valued products Example of how the above works? Current blockchain technology allows for the recording of property rights. But while users can prove that digital books belong to them, they cant necessarily prevent people from stealing or reading these books without permission. In such an environment, it is very difficult to monetize digital assets. Elastos aims to solve this problem by creating an environment in which the execution of a digital asset (i.e., the viewing, buying or selling of a digital movie) all take place on the Elastos Smart Web, and therefore abide by the rules of smart contracts. The creator of digital content can use a tool, provided by Elastos, to determine the number of digital assets to produce. Authors, for example, can decide that they only want to have 5000 copies of their books in circulation on the Smart Web. Setting a finite amount of digital content produces scarcity and enables the realization of capital. Elastos also wants to enable consumers to become investors. Say there are only 5000 digital books in circulation, and that these books become extremely popular. That means that every one of those books will increase in value, creating potential wealth for the people who bought them. After enjoying the book, the customer could sell it to someone else for a higher price. Users can also buy limited edition game apps. After playing those games in Elastos Runtime on their cell phones, they can sell the games to other people. Because these games are limited editions, their value will fluctuate on the second-hand market. In another use case, filmmakers could raise money for their movies by crowdfunding through issuing their tokens. The filmmakers could write a smart contract saying that every time someone watches the movie, token holders will get a small share of the fee. The filmmakers may also write another smart contract to let moviegoers sell the movie peer-to-peer or via social networks and receive commissions. This system creates financial opportunities for both creators and consumers, thus incentivizing more people to use Elastos. The accumulation of more users will incentivize more digital content creators to produce and publish content on the Elastos platform. This increase in content could then attract even more users, and those additional users will create more content. This is a positive cycle that will result in a large amount of valuable digital content that can be used to generate wealth. Ethereum v Elastos? Ethereum has one single mainchain structure which leads to the upper limit of computing power and extensibility[18]. Data transaction speed is limited by the individual node in the chain, though there are thousands of computation nodes. It is practically impossible to satisfy various needs in the future by only one chain. Elastos proposes to adopt a flexible main chain and sidechain blockchain design structure. The main chain is only responsible for basic transactions and payments while the sidechain executes smart contracts to support various applications and services. Ethereum has data redundancy and network congestion. The setting that smart contracts are exposed to DApps and all the data and code are placed on the mainchain leads to data redundancy in main storage. Now the scale of Ethereum data exceeds that of Bitcoin, while network congestions have occurred. Elastos runs applications on Elastos runtime as opposed to the already congested blockchain. This method is more secure. All network data must be sent through a trustable and verifiable channel. Identification and authentication come from the blockchain ID. This way, the blockchain's credibility can be transferred to Elastos Runtime. Elastos Runtime can have various forms like an independent OS, a virtual machine, or a software development kit(SDK) that integrates into native apps of other mainstream Operating Systems. Ethereum has data exposure risk. After obtaining data, DApps are run at the user frontend, causing possible data exposure. Elastos has safety is at the core, decentralized applications are forbidden from accessing the network so they are not subject to DDoS attacks. There is also no need for IP addresses so users are far less likely to get hacked. EOS v Elastos? Elastos Deep-Dive: The most comprehensive differences and similarities between Elastos and EOS and how they're solving two very different problems Bit University Q&amp;A with Rong Chen - The Operating system is like a country: Comparison with EOS EOS is a blockchain Operating System, but its development period and open source codes are much shorter than Elastos 18 plus years. Elastos has released more than 4 million lines of code to github and plans to release 10+ million lines of code in total(contributing to the open source community). EOS is dependent on its main-chain, so no matter how optimized it becomes, its throughput is limited. Elastos can extend the throughput infinitely with flexible main-chain and side-chain solution. Also, Elastos Runtime can deliver the trust function of the blockchain to a users application(like a cell phone, laptop, etc) which applies the blockchain to various scenarios in daily life. EOS, through the adoption of the delegated proof of stake(DPoS)consensus mechanism, can realize high throughput rate. Elastos computation bandwidth is distributed according to the number of tokens held. It refers to the design philosophy of time sliced distribution in the traditional multi-task Operating System and encourages the community to hold tokens. The main-chain design focuses on improving extensibility for smooth access to sidechain. The consensus mechanism on the sidechain can be anything(from DPoS to DBFT to anything else). EOS runs everything utilizing main chain for everything. Elastos services on the Elastos blockchain layer can be shared by multiple side chains. This greately lowers the mainchain pressure. When necessary, the sidechain can be duplicated to extend sidechain-level service capability through bifurcation mechanism, while the extension of this computing power can be infinite. Blockstack v Elastos? Blockstack combines encrypted, distributed storage and blockchain ID to make sure all the data belongs to the owner. Elastos applies a similar method for digital assets storage where users could apply for an ID for their digital assets on the blockchain, which guarantees the ownership of those digital contents but a key differentiation with blockstack is that the ownership of these digital contents will also be transferable and tradable, thereby making these digital assets consumable and investable and of high value, thereby contributing to a smart economy of trading digital goods. Even though the digital assets are decrypted, they cannot escape elastos runtime operating environment which guarantees that it will never disclose or damage the ownership of the digital contents. Blockstack saves encrypted data files in the cloud and hash stamps for these files are put on the blockchain as a proof mechanism but doing this is a trade-off between high credibility, low efficiency of blockchain and low credibility, high efficiency of traditional storage. Elastos has its P2P network layer called Elastos Carrier that focuses on making the Elastos blockchain cluster chain service integrated into the same network as the Elastos runtime thereby unifying the services with DApps so both the data and the ID of digital assets can have high credibility along with high efficiency for blockchain storage For the tech savy? Diagram to how Elastos VM works on top of android/ios devices Diagram to how Elastos Runtime works Diagram to how different components of Elastos - VM, runtime and browser work together Elastos Blockchain and Dapps on Elastos Elastos Carrier: Elastos Carrier is a completely decentralized peer-to-peer platform. This carrier takes over all network traffic between virtual machines and conveys information on applications behalf. Its a very infrastructure and supports the platform for the further development of DApp and operation. Features of Elastos Carrier include: Decentralized and Encrypted: ID Authentication step is required before information is transferred, which prevents DDoS attack from happening. Peer-to-peer (P2P) secures the communication: no central server, no content leaking or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. User Datagram Protocol-based Network Address Translation traversal for node network connection Efficient data transfer between distributed nodes, such as video and audio streaming or text messaging. In the centralized world there is a variety of communication tools including Gmail, WeChat ID, Alipay, WhatsApp etc. We are connected with each other using these tools associated with our IDs. There is an emerging trend and security necessity for people to have a totally decentralized ID system to identify each other, without 3rd party control  this is DID. Everyone needs a traceable ID for historical records. DID is built on the blockchain and provides a reliable ID to everyone and everything. The ID can be used for backtracing, authentication, and building trusted connections. By combining P2P and DID, Carrier leverages trusted ID to make communication more reliable, trustworthy and secure. Elastos VM: The VM runs on a host OS and has better integration with current mainstream OS such as Android and iOS. It ensures formation of a closed runtime environment enabling the separation from the host OS, ensuring safety of data and code. The Remote Service Interface replaces the traditional TCP/IP programming model, providing safe and reliable network transactions. This means no more IP addresses and a discovery mechanism will be used instead to access dapps and websites on the elastos internet(where each item has its own UUID - Universal Unique Identifier). Link to youtube Video: Elastos Runtime: A window into a new world of DApps Elastos Runtime: A software library that contains some of Elastos functionality. It provides the target OS applications with the needed Elastos functions, similar to the Alipay SDK serving other applications and making them capable of having payment functions. Elastos runtime can use trusted network communications and conduct safe and reliable data exchange and allows information exchange with the blockchain, confirming digital asset ownership and identity. Elastos Browser: A specialized browser where the Elastos runtime is embedded. In this browser, web applications can run with partial Elastos functions. Using Elastos browser bridges the gap to provide JS programming support for developing various applications. JS applications can use trusted network communications and conduct safe and reliable data exchange and also conduct information exchange with the main chain, confirming digital asset ownership and identity. The Elastos SDK will be provided to the developers around the world that they can use to make their apps on the elastos platform. Primarily, the app development can be done using C++, Java and Html5/JavaScript. Merged Mining: The Elastos blockchain utilizes merged mining with Bitcoin, the process by which consensus is reached on both chains simultaneously. In this case, the Bitcoin blockchain works as the parent blockchain to Elastos, with the Elastos chain as its auxiliary blockchain. The mining pools will deploy merged mining code and miners will submit proof of work to both blockchains at the same time. Energy consumption does not increase with merged mining, and will be equal to the energy consumed for mining either alone. Through this mechanism, the Elastos blockchain has an extremely strong guarantee of computing power and will then be able to provide blockchain innovations at a global scale. It makes full use of existing Bitcoin computing resources in addition to being environmentally friendly. Elastos implements merged mining with Bitcoin. The strategy of merged mining saves resources and avoids repeated consumption. Miner submits Proof of Work(PoW) to both Bitcoin and Elastos and enjoys profits of mining competition without extra consumption of computing power. The consensus mechanism for Elastos is AuxPoW+DPoS where the mining reward distribution is 35% for AuxPoW, 35% for DPoS, 20% for Ecosystem Application Reward and 10% for Foundation Running and Development. Tokens for apps built on Elastos can be published on sidechains. These tokens may participate in two-way asset transfer across the main chain and side chains. Additional benefits of merged mining include: The transfer of trust over multiple chains. The Elastos main chain is merged mined along with the Bitcoin main chain. This merged mining characteristic can be extended to Elastos sidechains as long as the sidechain adopts the same Proof of Work consensus. Thus, layers of chains can be merged mined recursively, which establishes a hierarchy of trust among chains. Isolated nodes. An auxiliary blockchain, or sidechain, dependent on merged mining does not need a consensus of multiple nodes. In the extreme case, one chain only needs one node and does not diminish the reliability of the ledger information on the main chain or other chains. No other blockchain consensus algorithm has this kind of advantage. Utilities of ELA(currency for Elastos)? The Elastos blockchain really only serves one function, being the ID system needed to connect into the Elastos intranet. The blockchain doesnt need to scale as its just storing simple IDs. This is important as unlike other platform blockchains like ETH etc which are trying to push millions of transactions through the blockchain (thus resulting in ballooning ledgers and scaling issues), here transactions go through the decentralised secure P2P network not the blockchain, so no scaling issues. Incentive for DApps to use Elastos does not come from an incentive to use the Elastos blockchain itself, this isnt Ethereum. DApps are incentivised to use the Elastos operating system/P2P infrastructure and using its blockchain for decentralised IDs is a requirement to use that. Other use cases are as follows: Dapps will be paying in ELA for the services they'll be using like cloud services, DNS services, acquisition of UUIDs for digital assets, etc Elastos ecosystem collaboration projects(dapps built on Elastos in collaboration with Elastos) have to lock no less than 2-5% of their project tokens published for converting into ELA. 20% of the project tokens(converted to ELA) will be used for Elastos foundation development. 80% of the actual project tokens will be rewards shared by all ELA holders. Eg. If a dapp decides to create 10 billion of tokenX, at least 200 million will be distributed. Out of these 200 million, 40 million will be converted to ELA and given to the Elastos foundation. The rest 160 million will be distributed to all ELA holders. So, if you are holding 300 ELA and the supply of all ela holders adds up to 10 million(locked and unlocked ela both), youll get approximately 4800 of tokenX airdropped to you for free. Users can use ELA to register an ID in Elastos and use this ID to purchase items such as DApps, cloud storage and many other resources, including other digital products and so on. Those who decide to lock their ELA(minimum of 300) will earn an interest of 4%, 5%, 6% for up to 3 years(not compounded year-to-year). ELA will be the main currency that will be used to reward developers for creating dapps on the Elastos platform. Users can participate in token sale projects and products with ELA within Elastos. Apps built on elastos can implement their system to process transactions using ela/sela. And many more Strategic Partnerships and Collaboration? How is NEO related to Elastos? - First of all, a common misconception is that Elastos is built on NEO platform. This is completely false. Elastos has its own blockchain and is NOT a NEP5 token. Elastos already has its main network that went live back in December 2017 at URL Da Hongfei of NEO and Jihan Wu of Bitmain are both early investors and advisors to Elastos. Jihan Wu has committed to redirecting hashing power from Bitcoin mining to Elastos. G3 is a co-operation between NEO, Elastos and Bitmain who share a vision of a decentralized economy and smart web. Key features of the smart web include the virtual machine, runtime environments and trust zone, provided by Elastos and Bitmain, consensus provided by NEO and KYC provided by Ontology. G3 is meant to cooperate with Chinese government regulations and considering two of the leading figures of Chinese blockchain are involved (Jihan Wu and Da Hongfei), the likelihood that these projects will greatly succeed when the Chinese adopt crypto-friendly regulations is very, very high. Foxconn group: World's largest electronics manufacturer - Elastos received a $31 million sponsorship from Foxconn group for R&amp;D: Foxconn Technology Group, is a multinational electronics contract manufacturing company headquartered in Tucheng, New Taipei, Taiwan.

Origin Agritech Ltd(Nasdaq public company): Origin is a world leading seeds provider company and is the first commercial seed company in China. Origin sells hybrid seeds in more than 10,000 locations down to Chinese small villages and rural agriculture area. It provides bio-technology agriculture seeds product called hybrid seeds. Origin also helps Chinese Ministry of Agriculture to track seed supply. With the help of Blockchain technology, tracking could become much more cost-effective and reliable because of the data on the blockchain is non-changeable. Not just for seeds, blockchain could be used for agriculture fruits too. For example, how to make sure the food is safe or how to test whether it is organic food or not. A blockchain tracking system could fulfill this need. Origin already has 20 years of business experience in China as it understands the needs of consumption. With the help of blockchain technology, manage, monetize and transfer farmland could become more efficient and easier. Sure, but how can I get started? Store your ELA in Elastos Wallet Exchange sites you can buy ELA in Huobi Bcex WARNING: You can only buy ELA from the sites listed above. Any other sites offering to buy/sell ELA are scams. Protect yourself. Please, DO NOT try to store ELA on MEW or NEON wallet or any other wallets out there because ELA has its own blockchain. It is neither an ERC20 token nor a NEP5 token."

Elastos has a number of DApps already building on the platform - Zapya is a good example on the consumer end for P2P file sharing with 500 million users. Elastos often talks about facilitating a real digital asset economy where scarcity and thus re-sale/trading of digital assets is possible (today if you buy a movie on the internet you cant resell it like you can in the real world, which Elastos thinks should be fixed). Again, a big market with essentially the whole eCommerce market as a target market, underpinned by the security of Elastos. * Third is enterprise DApps, i.e.B2B. Again this makes use of the P2P network, a good example here is ULink (China rentals) or the seed company Elastos has building DApps on it. Here the emphasis really is ability to track supply chain or information across the value chain and uses sidechains again. This market is large but this is where competitive advantage is weakest for Elastos as could use any blockchain for this purpose. **Brief Summary?** * Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger: Bitcoin introduced the power of decentralised ledger technology to the world, showing how we dont need financial institutions to transact value. Bitcoin's purpose is a digital currency, with the intent to become electronic cash. Bitcoin is great; however, it is extremely outdated. Bitcoin has very slow transaction times, expensive transaction fees and uses Proof of Work mining which is vastly uneconomical. Thanks to Bitcoin, the 2nd generation cryptocurrencies were born. * Ethereum = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts: Ethereum, as well as many others, are second generation cryptocurrencies. Ethereum was one of the first cryptocurrencies to introduce smart contracts and the concept of decentralised apps. Smart contracts put the trust of contracts in the trust of code. For example, If I bought a TV from an online merchant, the payment would only clear once the TV had arrived and I was satisfied with it. They can be coded to included things like 14-day money back guarantee and every other element that is in a normal contract. Drastically improving efficiency and breeds a new generation of trust. Ethereum is a great project, however the scalability of smart contracts that are hosted on the Ethereum network is limited. A game called CryptoKitties caused massive network congestion and that is just one of many decentralised applications that use smart contracts. * Elastos = Trustworthy Ledger + Smart Contracts + Monetizable Dapps and Digital Assets: Elastos is one of many new cryptocurrencies that are build on a third generation blockchain, focussing on a few main elements to combat the scalability issues that arise with 2nd generation cryptocurrencies: 1. Storage and Speed 2. Bugs within the Smart Contracts (security vulnerability). 3. Cost 4. Deletion of redundant data 5. Security The issue with second generation smart contracts is that they have to run solely on the blockchain, which causes network congestion and high transaction costs. Decentralized applications for Elastos are run by blockchain technology but can be built on current Operating Systems (IOS, Andriod and computer). Rong Chen understands the importance of ease of use for both the consumer and the producers. The integration of multiple well known coding languages make development relativity easier than other blockchains. They also support Android and Apple Operating Systems, which most other blockchains do not. Elastos is not just the new internet, but the entire smart economy. Focusing on digital assets, monetizing computing power and spare storage, financially incentive trade of digital assets all combined with the highest level of security and the removal of the middleman. With speed, security and minimal cost at the heart of Elastos, it is bound to scale over time. Elastos is a third generation blockchain technology that tackles the issues we have with second generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. **What is the business model for Elastos?** * Provide large blockchain applications with the secure running environment * Digital content remains intact after multiple uses * Big data and digital content can identify ownership on blockchain and correspond to tokens * Tokens can be transferred and traded legally on the blockchain, realizing future capital * Usage of tokens can consume/use digital content in Elastos Runtime. * Elastos can set a fixed limited amount for digital assets, thereby creating a scarcity of valued products **Development History(Tens of Millions of Open-Source Code spanning Decades)** * Rong Chen talks about Elastos' 17 years of history: URL * In 2000, Rong Chen, a senior alumnus of Tsinghua Universitys Computer Science department, returns to China from Microsoft USA and begins research and development for the first-generation Elastos network Operating System. * In 2003, Rong Chen was received by Jin-Tao Hu, the former CPC General Secretary. * In 2013, Foxconn makes investments in the Elastos Operating System open-source software project. * In 2017, Sunny Feng Han and Ji-Han Wu started running the Bitcoin Investment Elastos Blockchain Community and founded G3 with Bitmain and NEO. * In 2017, the Elastos Blockchain community received a global digital token investment worth 600 million RMB. **PARTNERSHIPS** * SAIC Motor: China's largest auto manufacturer.

The blockchain doesnt need to scale as its just storing simple IDs. This is important as unlike other platform blockchains like ETH etc which are trying to push millions of transactions through the blockchain (thus resulting in ballooning ledgers and scaling issues), here transactions go through the decentralised secure P2P network not the blockchain, so no scaling issues. Incentive for DApps to use Elastos does not come from an incentive to use the Elastos blockchain itself, this isnt Ethereum. DApps are incentivised to use the Elastos operating system/P2P infrastructure and using its blockchain for decentralised IDs is a requirement to use that. * **ELA tokenholders will get airdropped a special amount of every dApp tokens launched on Elastos as a platform.** this is known as *sugar dividends* * ELA tokenholders will have first-come buying rights at ICO price of every dApp. **Other use cases are as follows:** * Dapps will be paying in ELA for the services they'll be using like cloud services, DNS services, acquisition of UUIDs for digital assets, etc * Elastos ecosystem collaboration projects(dapps built on Elastos in collaboration with Elastos) have to lock no less than 2-5% of their project tokens published for converting into ELA. 20% of the project tokens(converted to ELA) will be used for Elastos foundation development. 80% of the actual project tokens will be rewards shared by all ELA holders. Eg. If a dapp decides to create 10 billion of tokenX, at least 200 million will be distributed. Out of these 200 million, 40 million will be converted to ELA and given to the Elastos foundation. The rest 160 million will be distributed to all ELA holders. So, if you are holding 300 ELA and the supply of all ela holders adds up to 10 million(locked and unlocked ela both), youll get approximately 4800 of tokenX airdropped to you for free. * Users can use ELA to register an ID in Elastos and use this ID to purchase items such as DApps, cloud storage and many other resources, including other digital products and so on. * Those who decide to lock their ELA(minimum of 300) will earn an interest of 4%, 5%, 6% for up to 3 years(not compounded year-to-year). * ELA will be the main currency that will be used to reward developers for creating dapps on the Elastos platform. * Users can participate in token sale projects and products with ELA within Elastos. * Apps built on elastos can implement their system to process transactions using ela/sela.

99,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Digital Ticks ICO. A level up in the cryptocurrency exchange.,4,8ig7m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8ig7m0/digital_ticks_ico_a_level_up_in_the/,2018-05-11 02:26:53,"Cryptocurrency exchange is vital to the successful operation of the whole cryptocurrency market. Many people's income is dependent on how quickly and efficiently they can trade their investments from one asset to another. Unfortunately the digital currency exchange systems that are currently in place are far from perfect. They are often plagued by low liquidity, inadequate customer service, lackluster security and high latency. These problems and more are why Digital Ticks Exchange was founded, and they have a rigid plan in place to remedy the situation. Digital Ticks is a first ever blockchain based commodity to crypto exchange, that was designed by traders for traders. In addition to being a crypto to crypto exchange it is also a semi-algorithm platform provider on its own. To solve the problem of low liquidity, Digital Ticks will have dedicated Market Makers  people ready to buy and sell on a regular and continuos basis at a publicly quoted price. Digital Ticks has created a customer service team that consist of people well versed in the exchange process and will raise the efficiency of the platform by knowing exactly what a novice trader, a professional trader or a high frequency trader needs. Unlike most cryptocurrency exchanges, Digital Ticks makes sure that their system undergoes continuous IT security and financial audits. They are going to perform regular vulnerability scans and assessments, security assessments and penetration testing  all to ensure the individual customer's security. As you can see, Digital Ticks aren't just another cryptocurrency exchange, they are completely customer oriented. The platform has been designed by people who are themselves experienced traders, so the features below were implemented with the convenience of clients in mind. Trading multiple instruments. Through a dedicated window provided by Digital Ticks exchange, traders will be able to put multiple orders in different instruments at the same time. OCO (one cancels the other) Order. It is well-known that the cryptocurrency market is very volatile. That's why it is important that a trader can perform actions in a timely manner. The OCO will allow to place a square off order as well as the stop loss order simultaneously. This way the trader can cancel their previous order, if they alter their decision at the last moment. Digital Ticks will support many custom Hot Keys and mouse commands. This feature was made to ease the life of high frequency traders and volume-based traders. A variety of shortcuts will be present to make sure the experience is as seamless as possible. Single Click Portfolio View is a feature allowing traders to monitor multiple instruments on a single screen. No longer would they have to have many windows open to observe the overall market. The Digital Ticks platform with all its features will be available for PC, Android and IOS, and also have API support. fsf.PNG Digital Ticks development team knows very well that traders are the most important and integral part of crypto exchange. That is why they created this user-friendly, feature packed, low latency crypto exchange platform in the first place. Even though the first few months after launch of the platform, Digital Ticks will not levy any transaction charges, as to attract more Market Makers and volume-based or high frequency traders, their trading fee and incentive policy is important to talk about. There will be a volume-based discount Model in place. To be considered a high volume trader you would require to hold 2000 DTX tokens in your wallet. Digital Ticks also value Market Makers very highly. So those who provide depth and liquidity to the marketplace will be eligible for a fee incentive in their trades. In general the trading fees on the platform are going to be minimal. Digital Ticks exchange is intending to publish the competitive transaction charges on the website through announcements, driving the fees to their lowest possible points. Overall the Digital Ticks exchange looks like a great place for traders to grow their influence comfortably and without the risk of hacks, DDoS attacks or phishing attempts. With the addition of a referral program, that promises to give users 5% of the commission that Digital Ticks earned from the referred clients, the system seems to be exceptional for both novice and professional traders. The DTX token issued by the platform is a Utility Token, built on Ethereum blockchain technology and ERC20 compatible. Only 128 million tokens will be created, never to be increased. Dae1zn_XkAA-ehX.jpg DTX token presale has started 25th of March 2018, so if you are interested in participating there is a link to the token sale website in the description. I also suggest to check out their referral program that is online during the DTX token sale phase.

100,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Elastos: The New Internet. A brief summary. Looking to be rich in 2020? Invest now!,2,8int0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8int0p/elastos_the_new_internet_a_brief_summary_looking/,2018-05-11 23:38:11,"What is Elastos? Elastos is a blockchain based operating system which is the world's first open source Internet Operating System. The Elastos Foundation was founded by Rong Chen and Sunny Feng Han, aiming to create a new Internet system powered by blockchain technology. On this new Internet, people will be able to own digital assets and generate wealth from them. Elastos will be used as the base-layer infrastructure rather than an application and has received sponsorship of over 200 million RMB from the Foxconn Group and other industry giants for its research and development. Elastos has open-sourced tens of millions of lines of source code, including more than four million lines of original source code. DApps are forced to never connect directly with the internet and only interact with the Elastos runtime (which in turn acts as a middle layer, then connecting to the internet) and youve essentially got a system thats 90% more secure than the way IoT or smart devices currently work. Today if I have 50 smart devices in my home, they all interact with the internet, I need to worry about 50 security threats. With Elastos, all I need to worry about is 1 threat, an attack on the Elastos runtime itself, this is a 10x better set-up and applies to IoT or frankly any device, with the beauty being its code written in C++ so any device can run it, even your fridge, and its open source, so any developer can make whatever DApps they want. The Elastos Value Proposition There are three major value propositions to Elastos. First is consumer/enterprise IoT as the key Elastos feature is security. In essence, this is targeting the onboarding of infrastructure/industrial software. DApps here would really be non-interactive secure software behind smart devices, not something you and I would really interact with on a tablet for example but necessary to be secure if you want sustainable IoT per above. Second is consumer DApps, i.e. B2C. This really takes advantage of the P2P network aspect of Elastos OS and user IDs on the blockchain, with the security being an added plus but not the prime driver per say. These DApps will have their own side chains/tokens for whatever utility they serve. Elastos has a number of DApps already building on the platform - Zapya is a good example on the consumer end for P2P file sharing with 500 million users.

Conversation with Su Yipeng, the Chief Architect of Elastos Bitcoin = Trustworthy Ledger: Bitcoin introduced the power of decentralised ledger technology to the world, showing how we dont need financial institutions to transact value.

Elastos is a third generation blockchain technology that tackles the issues we have with second generation cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum. Development History(Tens of Millions of Open-Source Code spanning Decades) Rong Chen talks about Elastos' 17 years of history: The most comprehensive Q&amp;A with Rong Chen about Elastos, his history, his success and failures and why he stuck with building a blockchain operating system In 2000, Rong Chen, a senior alumnus of Tsinghua Universitys Computer Science department, returns to China from Microsoft USA and begins research and development for the first-generation Elastos network Operating System. In 2003, Rong Chen was received by Jin-Tao Hu, the former CPC General Secretary. In 2013, Foxconn makes investments in the Elastos Operating System open-source software project. In 2017, Sunny Feng Han and Ji-Han Wu started running the Bitcoin Investment Elastos Blockchain Community and founded G3 with Bitmain and NEO. In 2017, the Elastos Blockchain community received a global digital token investment worth 600 million RMB. What is the Elastos Blockchain structure? Diagram to how merge mining works with bitcoin and Elastos Diagram to how elastos blockchain looks like and how P2P network is implemented Diagram to how elastos carrier works Through the merged mining with Bitcoin, the safety and reliability are ensured by strong Bitcoin computing power through Proof of Work. This mining strategy saves resources and avoids repeated consumption. Because Elastos structure is built by having a main chain and side chain, it avoids main chain being overloaded, and leads to easy routing and flexible extension, increasing the possibility for the Elastos to become basis for future internet applications. The blockchain is a trust zone and a reliable internet database. Smart contracts are merely the saving process of this reliable database. Only the valuable data that needs to be notarized is recorded on the blockchain; only the data processing that needs computation reliability requires smart contracts. What are Elastos mainchain and sidechains in elastos ecosystem? One of the highlights of the design is that it makes use of a blend of mainchains and sidechains to improve the computational ability of blockchain technology. The mainchain only executes simple transactions and payment transfers while the sidechain handles smart contracts to support services and applications. With this structure scalability and security can be accomplished. Similar to the Operating System on a mobile device, users need a trustworthy location to store important data. The Elastos blockchain works as this trust zone for the entire network Operating System. The Elastos blockchain applies main and sidechain solutions to facilitate the smart economy and a healthy decentralized application environment. This means that every application can create individual sidechains. The Elastos blockchain provides built-in, complete, easy-to-use sidechain support. They will also be customizable, allowing clients to pick a different consensus method depending on the use case. Any system built with blockchain technology has less computing power than a traditional computer, and so will not be able to meet the various requirements of internet applications (such as video games or streaming a high-definition movie). This is a fundamental reason why blockchains still cannot be applied on the internet at a large scale. The Elastos team recognizes this fact, and therefore believes that blockchain development should not rely solely on the main chain for computation. Elastos aims to scale their blockchain system by providing support for sidechains, which will help meet requirements for running applications with high IOPS. The Elastos main chain will be responsible for the small but very important role of trading and transferring ELA, thus providing stability to the blockchain system. Elastos wants to avoid bloating the main chain with unnecessary smart contracts. Instead, only major infrastructure upgrades will take place on the main chain. All other smart contracts can be implemented on sidechains, enabling scalability. This kind of hierarchical and structured design philosophy will pave the way for a future blockchain paradigm, such as the aforementioned development from stand-alone computation to a distributed one. This is a key innovation in blockchain technology, and more important than the partial technology of singular consensus algorithms and chains. The team will implement basic services as sidechains for global and public use. These services include ID generation, token distribution, digital asset trading, and fast payment systems. These basic services, all important infrastructural components, are part of the Elastos Smart Web. In addition, the team will also provide support for third-party sidechain development. Transactions are the most important part of the interface between the main and sidechains. The transaction procedure for sending tokens from the main chain to a sidechain is equivalent to sending from a user account on the main chain to a multi-signature address corresponding to the sidechain. The process automatically checks that the sidechain can identify the transaction and deposit the equivalent value of sidechain tokens to the sidechain account. What is the business model for Elastos? Provide large blockchain applications with the secure running environment Digital content remains intact after multiple uses Big data and digital content can identify ownership on blockchain and correspond to tokens Tokens can be transferred and traded legally on the blockchain, realizing future capital Usage of tokens can consume/use digital content in Elastos Runtime. Elastos can set a fixed limited amount for digital assets, thereby creating a scarcity of valued products Example of how the above works? How Digital Assets work on Elastos Platform Current blockchain technology allows for the recording of property rights. But while users can prove that digital books belong to them, they cant necessarily prevent people from stealing or reading these books without permission. In such an environment, it is very difficult to monetize digital assets. Elastos aims to solve this problem by creating an environment in which the execution of a digital asset (i.e., the viewing, buying or selling of a digital movie) all take place on the Elastos Smart Web, and therefore abide by the rules of smart contracts. The creator of digital content can use a tool, provided by Elastos, to determine the number of digital assets to produce. Authors, for example, can decide that they only want to have 5000 copies of their books in circulation on the Smart Web. Setting a finite amount of digital content produces scarcity and enables the realization of capital. Elastos also wants to enable consumers to become investors. Say there are only 5000 digital books in circulation, and that these books become extremely popular. That means that every one of those books will increase in value, creating potential wealth for the people who bought them. After enjoying the book, the customer could sell it to someone else for a higher price. Users can also buy limited edition game apps. After playing those games in Elastos Runtime on their cell phones, they can sell the games to other people. Because these games are limited editions, their value will fluctuate on the second-hand market. In another use case, filmmakers could raise money for their movies by crowdfunding through issuing their tokens. The filmmakers could write a smart contract saying that every time someone watches the movie, token holders will get a small share of the fee. The filmmakers may also write another smart contract to let moviegoers sell the movie peer-to-peer or via social networks and receive commissions. This system creates financial opportunities for both creators and consumers, thus incentivizing more people to use Elastos. The accumulation of more users will incentivize more digital content creators to produce and publish content on the Elastos platform. This increase in content could then attract even more users, and those additional users will create more content. This is a positive cycle that will result in a large amount of valuable digital content that can be used to generate wealth. Ethereum v Elastos? Ethereum has one single mainchain structure which leads to the upper limit of computing power and extensibility[18]. Data transaction speed is limited by the individual node in the chain, though there are thousands of computation nodes. It is practically impossible to satisfy various needs in the future by only one chain. Elastos proposes to adopt a flexible main chain and sidechain blockchain design structure. The main chain is only responsible for basic transactions and payments while the sidechain executes smart contracts to support various applications and services. Ethereum has data redundancy and network congestion. The setting that smart contracts are exposed to DApps and all the data and code are placed on the mainchain leads to data redundancy in main storage. Now the scale of Ethereum data exceeds that of Bitcoin, while network congestions have occurred. Elastos runs applications on Elastos runtime as opposed to the already congested blockchain. This method is more secure. All network data must be sent through a trustable and verifiable channel. Identification and authentication come from the blockchain ID. This way, the blockchain's credibility can be transferred to Elastos Runtime. Elastos Runtime can have various forms like an independent OS, a virtual machine, or a software development kit(SDK) that integrates into native apps of other mainstream Operating Systems. Ethereum has data exposure risk. After obtaining data, DApps are run at the user frontend, causing possible data exposure. Elastos has safety is at the core, decentralized applications are forbidden from accessing the network so they are not subject to DDoS attacks. There is also no need for IP addresses so users are far less likely to get hacked. EOS v Elastos? Elastos Deep-Dive: The most comprehensive differences and similarities between Elastos and EOS and how they're solving two very different problems Bit University Q&amp;A with Rong Chen - The Operating system is like a country: Comparison with EOS EOS is a blockchain Operating System, but its development period and open source codes are much shorter than Elastos 18 plus years. Elastos has released more than 4 million lines of code to github and plans to release 10+ million lines of code in total(contributing to the open source community). EOS is dependent on its main-chain, so no matter how optimized it becomes, its throughput is limited. Elastos can extend the throughput infinitely with flexible main-chain and side-chain solution. Also, Elastos Runtime can deliver the trust function of the blockchain to a users application(like a cell phone, laptop, etc) which applies the blockchain to various scenarios in daily life. EOS, through the adoption of the delegated proof of stake(DPoS)consensus mechanism, can realize high throughput rate. Elastos computation bandwidth is distributed according to the number of tokens held. It refers to the design philosophy of time sliced distribution in the traditional multi-task Operating System and encourages the community to hold tokens. The main-chain design focuses on improving extensibility for smooth access to sidechain. The consensus mechanism on the sidechain can be anything(from DPoS to DBFT to anything else). EOS runs everything utilizing main chain for everything. Elastos services on the Elastos blockchain layer can be shared by multiple side chains. This greately lowers the mainchain pressure. When necessary, the sidechain can be duplicated to extend sidechain-level service capability through bifurcation mechanism, while the extension of this computing power can be infinite. Blockstack v Elastos? Blockstack combines encrypted, distributed storage and blockchain ID to make sure all the data belongs to the owner. Elastos applies a similar method for digital assets storage where users could apply for an ID for their digital assets on the blockchain, which guarantees the ownership of those digital contents but a key differentiation with blockstack is that the ownership of these digital contents will also be transferable and tradable, thereby making these digital assets consumable and investable and of high value, thereby contributing to a smart economy of trading digital goods. Even though the digital assets are decrypted, they cannot escape elastos runtime operating environment which guarantees that it will never disclose or damage the ownership of the digital contents. Blockstack saves encrypted data files in the cloud and hash stamps for these files are put on the blockchain as a proof mechanism but doing this is a trade-off between high credibility, low efficiency of blockchain and low credibility, high efficiency of traditional storage. Elastos has its P2P network layer called Elastos Carrier that focuses on making the Elastos blockchain cluster chain service integrated into the same network as the Elastos runtime thereby unifying the services with DApps so both the data and the ID of digital assets can have high credibility along with high efficiency for blockchain storage For the tech savy? Diagram to how Elastos VM works on top of android/ios devices Diagram to how Elastos Runtime works Diagram to how different components of Elastos - VM, runtime and browser work together Elastos Blockchain and Dapps on Elastos Elastos Carrier: Elastos Carrier is a completely decentralized peer-to-peer platform. This carrier takes over all network traffic between virtual machines and conveys information on applications behalf. Its a very infrastructure and supports the platform for the further development of DApp and operation. Features of Elastos Carrier include: Decentralized and Encrypted: ID Authentication step is required before information is transferred, which prevents DDoS attack from happening. Peer-to-peer (P2P) secures the communication: no central server, no content leaking or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. User Datagram Protocol-based Network Address Translation traversal for node network connection Efficient data transfer between distributed nodes, such as video and audio streaming or text messaging. In the centralized world there is a variety of communication tools including Gmail, WeChat ID, Alipay, WhatsApp etc. We are connected with each other using these tools associated with our IDs. There is an emerging trend and security necessity for people to have a totally decentralized ID system to identify each other, without 3rd party control  this is DID. Everyone needs a traceable ID for historical records. DID is built on the blockchain and provides a reliable ID to everyone and everything. The ID can be used for backtracing, authentication, and building trusted connections. By combining P2P and DID, Carrier leverages trusted ID to make communication more reliable, trustworthy and secure. Elastos VM: The VM runs on a host OS and has better integration with current mainstream OS such as Android and iOS. It ensures formation of a closed runtime environment enabling the separation from the host OS, ensuring safety of data and code. The Remote Service Interface replaces the traditional TCP/IP programming model, providing safe and reliable network transactions. This means no more IP addresses and a discovery mechanism will be used instead to access dapps and websites on the elastos internet(where each item has its own UUID - Universal Unique Identifier). Elastos Runtime: A software library that contains some of Elastos functionality. It provides the target OS applications with the needed Elastos functions, similar to the Alipay SDK serving other applications and making them capable of having payment functions. Elastos runtime can use trusted network communications and conduct safe and reliable data exchange and allows information exchange with the blockchain, confirming digital asset ownership and identity. Elastos Browser: A specialized browser where the Elastos runtime is embedded. In this browser, web applications can run with partial Elastos functions. Using Elastos browser bridges the gap to provide JS programming support for developing various applications. JS applications can use trusted network communications and conduct safe and reliable data exchange and also conduct information exchange with the main chain, confirming digital asset ownership and identity. The Elastos SDK will be provided to the developers around the world that they can use to make their apps on the elastos platform. Primarily, the app development can be done using C++, Java and Html5/JavaScript. Merged Mining: The Elastos blockchain utilizes merged mining with Bitcoin, the process by which consensus is reached on both chains simultaneously. In this case, the Bitcoin blockchain works as the parent blockchain to Elastos, with the Elastos chain as its auxiliary blockchain. The mining pools will deploy merged mining code and miners will submit proof of work to both blockchains at the same time. Energy consumption does not increase with merged mining, and will be equal to the energy consumed for mining either alone. Through this mechanism, the Elastos blockchain has an extremely strong guarantee of computing power and will then be able to provide blockchain innovations at a global scale. It makes full use of existing Bitcoin computing resources in addition to being environmentally friendly. Elastos implements merged mining with Bitcoin. The strategy of merged mining saves resources and avoids repeated consumption. Miner submits Proof of Work(PoW) to both Bitcoin and Elastos and enjoys profits of mining competition without extra consumption of computing power. The consensus mechanism for Elastos is AuxPoW+DPoS where the mining reward distribution is 35% for AuxPoW, 35% for DPoS, 20% for Ecosystem Application Reward and 10% for Foundation Running and Development. Tokens for apps built on Elastos can be published on sidechains. These tokens may participate in two-way asset transfer across the main chain and side chains. Additional benefits of merged mining include: The transfer of trust over multiple chains. The Elastos main chain is merged mined along with the Bitcoin main chain. This merged mining characteristic can be extended to Elastos sidechains as long as the sidechain adopts the same Proof of Work consensus. Thus, layers of chains can be merged mined recursively, which establishes a hierarchy of trust among chains. Isolated nodes. An auxiliary blockchain, or sidechain, dependent on merged mining does not need a consensus of multiple nodes. In the extreme case, one chain only needs one node and does not diminish the reliability of the ledger information on the main chain or other chains. No other blockchain consensus algorithm has this kind of advantage. Utilities of ELA(currency for Elastos)? The Elastos blockchain really only serves one function, being the ID system needed to connect into the Elastos intranet. The blockchain doesnt need to scale as its just storing simple IDs. This is important as unlike other platform blockchains like ETH etc which are trying to push millions of transactions through the blockchain (thus resulting in ballooning ledgers and scaling issues), here transactions go through the decentralised secure P2P network not the blockchain, so no scaling issues. Incentive for DApps to use Elastos does not come from an incentive to use the Elastos blockchain itself, this isnt Ethereum. DApps are incentivised to use the Elastos operating system/P2P infrastructure and using its blockchain for decentralised IDs is a requirement to use that. Other use cases are as follows: Dapps will be paying in ELA for the services they'll be using like Domain name registrations, search engines, page rankings, acquisition of UUIDs for digital assets, etc. They'll all be using ELA which subsides for bandwidth, IPFS, etc Elastos ecosystem collaboration projects(dapps built on Elastos in collaboration with Elastos) have to lock no less than 2-5% of their project tokens published for converting into ELA. 20% of the project tokens(converted to ELA) will be used for Elastos foundation development. 80% of the actual project tokens will be rewards shared by all ELA holders. Eg. If a dapp decides to create 10 billion of tokenX, at least 200 million will be distributed. Out of these 200 million, 40 million will be converted to ELA and given to the Elastos foundation. The rest 160 million will be distributed to all ELA holders. So, if you are holding 300 ELA and the supply of all ela holders adds up to 10 million(locked and unlocked ela both), youll get approximately 4800 of tokenX airdropped to you for free. Users can use ELA to register an ID in Elastos and use this ID to purchase items such as DApps, cloud storage and many other resources, including other digital products and so on. Those who decide to lock their ELA(minimum of 300) will earn an interest of 4%, 5%, 6% for up to 3 years(not compounded year-to-year). ELA will be the main currency that will be used to reward developers for creating dapps on the Elastos platform. Users can participate in token sale projects and products with ELA within Elastos. Apps built on elastos can implement their system to process transactions using ela/sela. And many more Strategic Partnerships and Collaboration? How is NEO related to Elastos? - First of all, a common misconception is that Elastos is built on NEO platform. This is completely false. Elastos has its own blockchain and is NOT a NEP5 token. Elastos already has its main network that went live back in December 2017 at URL Da Hongfei of NEO and Jihan Wu of Bitmain are both early investors and advisors to Elastos. Jihan Wu has committed to redirecting hashing power from Bitcoin mining to Elastos. G3 is a co-operation between NEO, Elastos and Bitmain who share a vision of a decentralized economy and smart web. Key features of the smart web include the virtual machine, runtime environments and trust zone, provided by Elastos and Bitmain, consensus provided by NEO and KYC provided by Ontology. G3 is meant to cooperate with Chinese government regulations and considering two of the leading figures of Chinese blockchain are involved (Jihan Wu and Da Hongfei), the likelihood that these projects will greatly succeed when the Chinese adopt crypto-friendly regulations is very, very high. Foxconn group: World's largest electronics manufacturer - Elastos received a $31 million sponsorship from Foxconn group for R&amp;D: Foxconn Technology Group, is a multinational electronics contract manufacturing company headquartered in Tucheng, New Taipei, Taiwan.

Protect yourself. Please, DO NOT try to store ELA on MEW or NEON wallet or any other wallets out there because ELA has its own blockchain. It is neither an ERC20 token nor a NEP5 token."
101,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,3 interesting cyber-security projects that are blockchain based reviewed by Cyber security geek &amp; crypto supporter,37,8jarqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8jarqf/3_interesting_cybersecurity_projects_that_are/,2018-05-14 18:48:33,"As a dedicated crypto lover and cyber security geek, I have been doing some serious research about cyber security companies that are blockchain based. Unfortunately, there arent so many cyber security projects who are blockchain based as I thought they will be, but having some that are currently up and running still brings some positivity for a cyber security geek like me... **Disclaimer : Im not encouraging nor recommending you to invest at the projects Im reviewing below. Everything that is written over here has been written by me, from a professional perspective and not as investor or trader. Some facts about the industry before we start the review: 1.Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021. 2.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 3. Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $5 billion in 2017 4.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 Now, after realizing the size of opportunities and the huge amount of money this market is generating, its time to review 3 interesting projects that can make a great impact on both cyber security and blockchain industries. **[PolySwarm](URL Polyswarm present themselves as the first decentralize antivirus marketplace.By creating a new marketplace that will connect between cyber security experts(malware researchers in particular) and different AV(anti-virus) companies that are looking to outsource their efforts to find and detect new malwares. Their team is built by cybersecurity experts, which gives them a big advantage on the technical side. The other interesting move that PolySwarm came up with, is the fact that they will reward their community of cybersecurity experts with tokens for accurate malware identification. **[Cybervein](URL Cybervein offers a Universal network of decentralized databases. How does it work? This network will be the first distributed ledger system that can decentralize complex datasets and easily manage them on the blockchain itself, without actually having to deal with centralized storage providers. One of the biggest benefits behind their idea is that they allow multiple parties to process shared their disturbed databases. On a nutshell, they will provide a database that is immutable and protect from tampering (like bitcoin transactions on blockchain). Their leadership is built mainly by finance people so its interesting to see how high they can take this project to. **[Levelnet](URL Levelnet is looking to become the first decentralized antivirus platform. each user at Levelnet shares his virus detection data by secure protocol in a real time in order to provide a full coverage of real-time antivirus that is built on top of their decentralized protocol in order to protect against zero-day attacks. You probably ask yourself what is a zero day attack? Here is a quick input on that: A zero-day is an attack that exploits a previously unknown security vulnerability. Unlike using a regular anti virus software, where each software has its own detection method, Levelnet plans to provide an all-in-one place solution for protecting their end users from new and unrecognized threats.

102,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Attacks That Unmask Anonymous Blockchain Transactions Can Be Used Against Everyone Who Ever Relied on the Defective Technique,0,87vr4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/87vr4k/attacks_that_unmask_anonymous_blockchain/,2018-03-29 08:30:02,"URL From the article: &gt; In An Empirical Analysis of Traceability in the Monero Blockchain, a group of eminent computer scientists analyze a longstanding privacy defect in the Monero cryptocurrency, and reveal a new, subtle flaw, both of which can be used to potentially reveal the details of transactions and identify their parties. &gt;But the Monero problems exemplify a special problem of blockchain anonymity. By design, every transaction in the blockchain is irrevocably, universally, permanently public. That means that when new defects are discovered in a blockchain-based anonymity tool, **attackers can download all the transactions that ever took place under the flawed anonymity protocol and go to work de-anonymizing them. ** &gt;**In the Monero case, it's especially grave**, as the cryptocurrency's initial adopters were largely people producing illegal substances on dark markets, who face legal reprisals if they're unmasked. From the paper: &gt;Monero users should be warned that their prior transactions are likely vulnerable to tracing analysis **A significant fraction (91%) of non-RingCT Monero transactions with one or more mixins are deducible (i.e., contain at least one deducible mixin)**, and therefore **can be conclusively traced.** Furthermore, we estimate that among all transaction inputs so far, **the Guess-Newest heuristic can be used to identify the correct mixin with 80% accuracy. ** &gt;**Even after accounting for publicly deanonymized transactions such as pool pay- outs(!!!),** we find that at least **a few hundred transactions per day** in mid 2016 and **more than a thousand transactions per day** from September 2016 through January 2017 would be vulnerable. Furthermore, we estimate that at most a quarter of these can be attributed to illicit marketplaces like AlphaBay. **These users might have incorrectly assumed that Monero provided much higher privacy, especially for transactions taking place in late 2016. ** &gt;Because many transactions on AlphaBay are criminal offenses, with statutes of limitations that will not expire for many years (if ever), these users remain at risk of deanonymization attacks. We stress that illicit businesses tend to be early adopters of new technology, but there exist many legitimate reasons to use privacy-centric cryptocurrencies (e.g., a journalist protecting her sources). While such scenarios are less visible, their users face the same risk of deanonymization. &gt;Towards fulfilling this recommendation, we released an initial draft of this paper to the Monero community. We believe it has been in the best interest of Monero users that we offered this warning as soon as possible, even before countermeasures have been deployed. One reason for our decision is that the data from the Monero blockchain is public and widely replicated, and thus delaying the release would not mitigate post-hoc analysis, which can be carried out at any future time. &gt; Second, **countermeasures in future versions of the Monero client will not affect the vulnerability of transactions occurring between the time of our publication and the deployment of such future versions.** &gt; Complementing this paper, we have launched a block explorer (URL which displays the linkages between transactions inferred using our techniques. We recommend additionally developing a wallet tool that users can run locally to determine whether their previous transactions are vulnerable. Submitter : The only quibble I have with the article is that this information is not 'new' per se. It is certainly going to be news to a lot of Monerons, but this paper is about a year old now. "
103,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,POWH3D,0,896x0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/896x0m/powh3d/,2018-04-03 10:48:20,"I've seen some discussion on this lately and thought I'd try to clear some things up. Powh3D is a contract on the eth network that is very popular right now with over 13000 eth and counting in the contract. What is Powh3D? Should you invest? I'll do my best to answer that. Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer, financial advisor, or a resident of the US. You should not make financial decisions based on my advice. Powh3d is a new contract based on the concept of the original contract, powh. Powh was first launched over a month ago and essentially sold ""shares"" in the contract for eth. For every buy and sell, 10% of the eth would be distributed amongst ""shareholders"" equally and the price of ""shares"" would increase on a buy and decrease on a sell. I personally invested a little into this scheme but unfortunately the contract was emptied due to an exploit in the contract. Because of this hack, powh3d supposedly underwent vigorous testing to ensure that the contract was completely safe. Unless you are an expert in solidity or machine code (lol) you're gonna have to take them at their word. However, it is pretty easy to verify that the code does what they say it does (that is, distribute eth of buy and sell as dividends, price of share changes based on buy or sell). Should you invest? Well, you have to realise, buying in costs you little less than 20% of your investment immediately (10% on buy-in, 10% on sell). So you have to depend on dividends and also the price of the shares increasing if you want to make a profit, which means you should probably think it through. But there is also lot of misinformation about this contract. First, it is not ponzi, it is a pyramid scheme. In a ponzi, there is not enough to pay off all investors. In powh3d, there is always enough to pay off all investors assuming there is no vulnerability in the contract. There is no function to close the contract or siphon funds to the creators. It is a pyramid scheme because it depends on other people buying in to pay dividends to shareholders. I do notice some differences in the classification of [pyramid schemes](URL and the functioning of the contract. I cannot say if it's legal or not, but I think you could make the argument that Powh3D is a ""skill based game"" rather than a pyramid scheme. So some of you might be thinking: Woo-hoo! I am guarantee to make money. This is not true. Please don't think this. You could just as easily lose money when you sell out. There is no guarantees, if the contract ever reaches 0 eth the amount of eth lost will be identical to the amount of eth gained. This is my [metamask address](URL if you want to see an example of what the contract does."
104,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,The verge attack got me thinking about the importance of bug bounty programs.,1,8b1gug,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8b1gug/the_verge_attack_got_me_thinking_about_the/,2018-04-10 05:59:23,"Whoever discovered the vulnerability only had one way of monetizing their knowledge, which was to attack the coin. If verge had used the 75m XVG for a bug bounty program then the hacker could have given the developers time to come up with a tested fix. I'd looked at some bug bounty programs, not because I know how to find vulnerabilities but because with the value and cutting edge nature of crypto there are bound to be bugs that can be found by the bad guys. It reduces the chance of a coin getting damaged by an attack and losing most of it's value. I think most of the main coins have bug bounties either as a stand-alone program like URL or part of an industry program like URL However this all needs funding, either by donations or a governance model which I guess explains why some coins dont bother."
105,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,SmartCash or Dash? What's a safer investment?,2,7xln3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xln3d/smartcash_or_dash_whats_a_safer_investment/,2018-02-15 08:50:08,"I having trouble deciding between the two. Its hard to get info from subreddits because people always seem to defend their coin to the death. I need an unbiased general opinion based on what I know, and what others might know. These two coins are very similar. What I learned so far ##SmartCash## *PROS* - 1 smartcash is needed for 1 vote on proposals As oppose to Dash, you need to own a node to vote. - Smart Nodes are Cheaper than Dash nodes - InstantPay feature like dash's instant send - seems to have its own nitch by cornering the market in 3rd world countires. - Lower marketcap than Dash so it has more potential for growth. - Same devs from Dash. *CONS* Riddled with problems **- Vulnerability** The coin was hacked a month ago, and someone minted millions of coins. As a result the devs had to order the shutdown all deposits/withdrawals for every exchange including their wallets. Everyone's current pending transactions on all exchanges were halted, and caught in limbo until the devs were able to burn off some of the supply, and the exchanges updated their wallets. This was a month long process where all exchanges had to rollback 2 days worth of transactions , credit users and rebroadcast their transactions which resulted in smart cash being completely delisted from Cryptopia. Everything seemed to finally get fixed , and pre existing transactions to wallets continued, but not until after the the wallet Snap shot date to receive smart rewards for the next month. Users who lost out because of the halted transactions were up in arms , and in other words were basically told they were shit out of luck when requesting a grace period . This didn't seem very fair. After all, the smart rewards were what enticed most users to buy in the first place. **- On going exchange issues.** To make up for cryptopia delisting smartcash, it was listed on a new exchange CryptoBridge. However, the first day CryptoBridge had to shut down transactions for an update, and HiTBtc still has their wallets in maintenance mode, Some are claiming foul play on HiTBTC. We will see. Also recently coin exchange had to shutdown smartcash for maintenance. Here we go again The nightmare doesnt seem to end with exchanges, it seems like everyone is blaming the issue on the exchanges when in reality its a little bit of both. **- Communication** There seems to be a huge lack in communication. The team only issues updates on Discord so new comers often seem lost at first finding answers. They usually have to riddle the subreddit with the same repeated questions only to find they are getting lashed because users find it annoying until finally the Mods can inform them to go on discord for answers . However this is a problem for the less computer literate average Joe in his 40 s. They don't know what the hell discord is so they usually just give up at that point. Directions for Live support also isnt immediately visable on the website . **-SmartNode Issues** After the much anticipated release of the smartnode , payouts were highly flawed, only a few nodes were getting the majority of the rewards , while others got zero. Again, this was a big issue that took time to correct . it also led to questions of foul play that were blown off as being just a bug. I cant really blame peoplr. I dont have any knowledge on how to build a node, but from a customer standpoint, it seems fishy . theres been so much bad news of hacks all over the place in the crypto world. ##Dash## *PROS* - Instant Send Feature - Leading Smartcash in mass adoption - Strong security - support team is strong, and getting answers to common questions seems very easy. *CONS* - you have to own a node to vote This is way too expensive , and only leaves power to people with money to vote . The little guys have to sit back and watch decisions be made for them. That's just not cool at all. - High Market Cap The gains seem to be limited as oppose to smartcash. I can't really see this overtaking juggernauts like Lite Coin, NEO, or Stellar anytime soon. 10x gains seem bleak at best as oppose to smartcash low market cap, Despite Dash having way less problems, I feel that smartcash seems to be more geared towards the little guy. However, Dash seems to be ahead of the game when catering to the little guys who own it small businesses . Pawn shops being one example. On the other hand Smartcash seems to be winning the game when appealing to 3rd world countries. That can spread also. So I'm stuck. Where would you dump your money in if you had the choose? What other info am I missing that needs to be noted? Thanks. "

The only way i can think of right now to not let the recipient know my balance, is by sending it from an exchange account, since they use a whole mumbo jumbo of accounts to send shit through. I owe a friend of mine some money. He and i are crypto supporters, so i would love to send it to him via crypto, but i don't want him to know how much i got... Edit: Okay guys thanks for the hint with monero and other privacy coins. But is this really the endgame? After all, bitcoin, litecoin, etc., are supposed to replace FIAT. They want to be used as a currency. Right now i don't see that happening with this ""vulnerability"". Btw, it't not only a problem when sending money to friends.

107,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Shower-thought: Blockchain as a tool for combating fake news and the manipulation of digital media,5,7xtctd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7xtctd/showerthought_blockchain_as_a_tool_for_combating/,2018-02-16 07:38:36,"Recently, Buzzfeed highlighted [the work of Aviv Ovadya](URL who predicts that in the coming decades, well face a global crisis of confidence which he terms the Infocalypse. Ovadya is deeply concerned by the emergence of AI-infused software packages that allow for the easy, seamless editing of pictures, audio, and video to convincingly depict events and sound bites that never actually happened. Imagine, for instance, if a state actor released fabricated video footage of a political candidate in a compromising position, or sound clips from a supposed national ally in secret talks with an enemy. If released via social media platforms, and propped up by networks of bots/the occasional figure of authority with aligned interests, this sort of information warfare could readily sway public discourse, resulting in catastrophically negative outcomes. If only, you might think, there were were a trustless, decentralized mechanism by which digital information could be assessed for its validity, and recorded on a permanent distributed ledger which could be retroactively referenced to determine whether it had been tampered with. In an era where the very foundation of truth and objective reality is under attack, wouldnt it be great if there were some means of establishing shared, non-manipulable consensus about the legitimacy of information and the ordinality of events and transactions. If this reminds you of the properties of the blockchain, congratulations - you have a keen eye for context clues! :) The proposal is effectively this  could we establish a universal standard, wherein original digital video, images, and sound files are encoded with metadata that is committed to the blockchain? This metadata serves as a unique identifier for this source file, such that any future versions that incorporate elements of this source file are intrinsically linked via this reference ID, creating an ancestral history of the origin of digital media. This metadata may also be used to cross-reference a descendant version of a media file with its progenitor, in order to assess the ways in which it has been modified from its original form. Relatively benign modifications (say, video cropping or lighting adjustments on digital photos) would be no cause for alarm, but modifications which indicate the splicing of separate media sources or the use of more intensive video editing techniques, could be flagged as potential cases of misleading manipularion of digital media. In instances where the media in question is particularly inflammatory or consequential, a universally accessible, permanent record of the source of the content would be invaluable for assessing its veracity. Naturally, all future digital media will not be encoded with this blockchain-codified metadata. While one might envision a world where this sort of standard process is legally required of the manufacturers of phones, cameras, and other recording implements (much like the government enacts emissions regulations on car manufacturers), this seems like an unlikely outcome due to legacy devices, privacy concerns, etc. But, for journalists and news outlets with a vested interest in maintaining their irrefutable credibility, this could be a universal standard for the legitimacy of recorded media. The only digital media which garners trust would be that which has a time-stamped entry on the blockchain registering when, how, and where this media was captured, and how it has been digitally manipulated in the intervening time prior to publication. We should expect that there will be malicious elements who will look to circumvent/corrupt this sort of system  if they can, for instance, edit a video to fit their agenda, and then re-record this edited video, this may be a way to circumvent hardware-encoded controls. Likewise, if the means of committing media to the blockchain can be corrupted (i.e. tricking the recording device into attaching metadata to an existing, untagged file, etc), this would be a significant point of vulnerability. I am not a tech/cryptography buff, and I dont have the answers as to what measures should be taken to prevent these exploits. But, in light of the growing use of social media, bot armies, and AI-enabled media editing, I think this is something that the blockchain community should think about. Additional points of discussion include: * What are the risks of this sort of approach, both for personal security/privacy, and for corruption by malicious elements? * What are the technical requirements of this sort of system? How can we definitively capture the unique identifier of an original source file, with assurance that it is not derived from some prior source? * How can legacy images which lack metadata be validated and incorporated into this structure? * Should all images be committed to this structure? Or should it only be expected of images shared by news outlets, social media platforms, etc? * Is this approach feasible from a data storage perspective? Given the ubiquitous nature of recording devices in modern society, is it feasible to store the associated metadata for every image or recording that is produced? * Should this system be tokenized/monetized to encourage adoption (e.g. tokens awarded for committing original images)? * Is this within the purview of government regulation, or would the government be overstepping its bounds by enforcing adherence? In case youre curious as to whether blockchain has been explored for fake news prevention, here are a couple of related articles. The overarching theme is that news stories are validated via community curation, rather than immutable identifiers. URL URL Lastly, heres a journal article from 2016 that discusses exactly this sort of approach (cryptographic image authentication), in much more rigor, but without explicit mention of blockchain as the associated data structure: URL Thanks for taking the time to read this - I would love to hear this communitys thoughts on this approach, as well as if there are any existing start-ups who are focused on tackling this problem.

108,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Do you use mobile wallets?,3,7zwe6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7zwe6l/do_you_use_mobile_wallets/,2018-02-24 23:49:22,"The reason I'm asking is my safety concern. With all the apps we are installing nowadays, we don't have control over all the functions they possesses. I.e mobile games may have the ability to have a service opened in the background which could possibly read your inputs - like a keylogger for instance. I would not want to put in my seed and sync my wallet if there is a potential threat hidden in one of the other apps I've installed. Even the 2FA may be compromised. From my understanding this may be a large vulnerability for us using our phones as our bank. I've not tried any mobile apps yet because of this and know far to little about what security measures the devs implement for these wallets. It just seems scary af. What do you guys think? "
109,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Kyber Network - An Introduction,24,7qy8d6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qy8d6/kyber_network_an_introduction/,2018-01-17 14:42:22,"When Ethereum was first introduced, many people had anticipated that it would become the mammoth it is today. At the time of writing, the market capitalization of Ethereum is already over $90 billion, with a host of DApps (decentralized applications) including Digix, Gnosis, Golem and Melonport, to name a few, and contributing to the further expansion of the ecosystem. Interestingly, the emergence of DApps in the blockchain space re-instigated the ICO (initial coin offering) phenomenon, in which start-ups conduct fundraising events based on token sales to finance further development of their project. Through ICOs, companies and organizations introduce their crypto-assets, or colloquially known as tokens, to the public. These tokens are a new form of tradable digital asset made possible by blockchain technology. ##The Side Effects of Having Many Crypto-tokens We are approaching an ecosystem with a huge amount of diverse crypto-assets. As more and more projects raise fund through the launches of platform tokens, the number of tokens in the market will increase. Over time, investors of blockchain companies and contributors of the various protocols will acquire a variety of desired tokens as part of their investment strategies. However, limited option to liquidate tokens in the market makes convertibility of one token to another token a new challenge for both investors and operators alike. Further, having more tokens in the market also means more options for payments, putting more pressure to merchants to accept all forms of tokens from users. ***** ##The Elephant in the Room: Crypto-assets Exchanges Today, daily trades between notable cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether are in the millions. Similarly, average daily trades between ether and other crypto-assets, most of which are less than 2 years of age, are also in the millions. Having said that, despite the decentralized and trustless nature of crypto-assets, the major fraction of trading volume is on centralized exchanges, which are still subject to internal fraud and external hacking. This is an ongoing concern as various hacking incidents have been reported at different exchanges affecting thousands of users and causing loss of hundreds of millions of dollars. Not only that, existing exchanges, whether centralized or decentralized, often required users to wait for several minutes before a trade can be confirmed and allow users to withdraw sales proceed out of the exchange. This means that the selling price that users see when an order is placed might not necessarily be the price charged when the same order is filled. Despite already having several offerings in the market now, there are still issues that decentralized exchanges have to address before they are ready for mainstream adoption. These issues/ challenges consist of low liquidity, lack of user friendliness and so on. For example, some of the decentralized exchanges keep their order book on-chain. Nothing wrong with that, but doing so makes adjustment and cancellation of bids costly due to the compounding of transaction costs, a result of repeated revisions of orders until a match between the buy and sell side is found. Moreover, the delay between when an order is created and when an order is added to a block creates a buffer that can be exploited by attackers. (Read more [here](URL To address the issues that centralized and decentralized exchanges face, Kyber Network was born. ***** ##Introducing Kyber Network Very simply, Kyber Network is a decentralized and trustless exchange that facilitates instant conversions between crypto-assets. Through Kyber Networks service, a user can send token A to an intended recipient who wishes to receive the payment in token B in a single transaction. Not only that, Kyber Network will also introduce a new smart contract interface that would allow existing wallets, which only accepts certain specific tokens (e.g. Jaxx only accepts REP, GNT, etc. but not others), to receive any existing or future token (e.g. PAY and CVC) without having to modify the token contract code (i.e. the recipient is not aware that the payment actually was proxied via Kyber Network). In other words, Kyber Network enables smart contracts and recipients to access a wider class of users and receive contributions and payments from any token that the platform supports. ***** ##How Kyber Network Differs from other exchanges? Speed and Security. Kyber Network is block-instantaneous and it significantly reduces the buffer between when an order is made and when it is filled. As soon as the transaction which initiates the order gets accepted into a block, the trade is confirmed. This feature offers users greater trading security as it eliminates the vulnerability a result of the acceptance window of transactions that could be exploited by attackers. By design, Kyber Network operator does not hold users tokens and orders are enforced by smart contracts, so these tokens are secured from theft losses. Liquidity Guaranteed. Kyber Network guarantees liquidity by a combination of the following 2 ways: 1: Leveraging on its own reserve warehouse, which holds an appropriate amount of crypto-tokens; 2: Reserves in the network managed by independent reserve managers, which may or may not be directly associated to the Kyber Network operator. Each of the reserve can make its own price for every token pair that it supports. When there is a request for converting from token A to to token B, the Kyber operator contract will pick the best rate from all the reserves to process the request. Compatibility and On-chain Exchange. In addition, since Kyber Network runs on chain and all the trades are instantaneously confirmed, Kyber Network works with all accounts, including normal accounts and smart contracts. With Kyber Network, orders are matched between senders and recipients without any intervention from third party, thereby allowing users to send and receive tokens of any kind without the need to alter the form of contracts and the underlying protocol of Ethereum. ***** ##How Does it work? Kyber Networks innovative approach to guarantee the liquid, trustless and instant convertibility of tokens involves these 5 actors. Each of the actors illustrated in [this diagram](URL interacts with the smart contract independently in a different way, and collectively, the dynamic reserve pool within Kyber Network is able to feed a users request to convert a token to another within a single transaction. Moreover, Kyber Network allows multiple reserves to co-exist so that the platform can offer the best conversion rate between a range of tokens for users. Other than the reserve managed by Kyber Networks operator, individuals or organizations not associated to Kyber Network can also participate in the system by registering with Kyber Network to contribute to the overall reserve pool, and become the reserve manager of their proposed entity. By enabling this, Kyber Network is essentially setting up channels to facilitate conversions and transactions of low-trading-volume tokens. In this case, Kyber Network does not hold the funds managed by independent reserve managers, but Kyber Network will ensure that their reserve contracts comply to the platforms terms. [More details on how Kyber Network works can be found in our whitepaper here](URL ***** ##How Are Reserve Managers Incentivized? Kyber Network creates a platform for reserve managers to monetize their otherwise idle assets. By serving trade requests from users, reserves earn profit from the spread determined by reserve managers. As Kyber Network gain more traffic through collaborations with wallet providers and various other token projects, reserve managers are likely to benefit directly from the trading volume due to network effects within Kyber Network. In addition, Kyber Network provides a reserve dashboard software to help reserve managers monitor transactions to and from their reserves. The reserve dashboard will come with standard and popular trading algorithms and strategies, which reserve managers can employ to automatically set prices and rebalance their portfolio. This flexibility of the platform allows reserve managers to implement and deploy their own strategies when and where they see fit. ***** ##What Else Does the Platform Offer To Users? The illiquidity of crypto-assets results in highly volatile exchange rates between tokens due to irregular and unpredictable demand and supply. Worse, unless the trading volume of a token is significant, hardly any exchange would warehouse the tokens, and that limits token holders options to trade or liquidate a particular token. As such, it is impossible for token holders to hedge their positions to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in the future. In view of this, Kyber Network will be addressing the liquidity challenge by introducing derivative trading including options and forward contracts. Options. Option contracts allow users to hedge against adverse price movement for a fee known as a premium. A call option gives the owner of the contract the right to purchase a crypto-asset at an agreed price, while a put option allows the owner of the contract to sell a crypto-asset at an agreed price. The premium here will be calculated using the implied volatility of the underlying crypto-asset. Forward Contract. In a forward contract, involved parties agree to execute a trade at a later date at a price specified in the present. Forward contract will be useful in a case where token holders need a specified amount of tokens at a future date. For example, assuming that Alice has Melon tokens and she wishes to acquire some Ether to invest in an upcoming ICO in three weeks time. Her option is either to exchange Melon tokens for Ether now, or she could enter and purchase a forward contract due in three weeks to negate the risk of Ethers price fluctuations, should she wish to hold on to her Melon tokens for a longer time or she is waiting for an event where she would receive her Melon tokens. ***** ##Token Utility - how does it appeal to investors: The main token utility is for reserve managers to use KNC to pay fees for each transaction, meaning that users dont need to hold KNC to operate on the platform. This creates a seamless interface where transaction fees are priced into token conversions. Large companies/reserve managers are likely to stockpile and hold tokens for future payments, thus reducing overall circulating supply and driving up price. KNC paid for these fees will be burnt, thus lowering supply and due to supply and demand economics will likely cause the individual token price to increase. Fees are paid as a small percentage of the cost of the transaction. For example, in a transaction to convert $100 worth of ETH to another token, and the token fee is 0.1%, $0.1 **worth** of KNC will be burnt. This token utility model was cocreated and advised by Vitalik, a similiar model can be found in his blog post [here](URL ***** ##What Is Kyber Networks State Now?

110,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,VeChain (VEN) = Sleeping Giant,81,7qyxbo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7qyxbo/vechain_ven_sleeping_giant/,2018-01-17 16:47:13,"I'm in a closed group of crypto-investors that take varying approaches to crypto investment. I pick my crypto investments on a macro political-socioeconomic perspective; however, others in the group use different gauges (e.g. chart technical analysis, best technology application, crypto Satoshi purists, etc.). I prefer cryptos that fit specific market/business needs, have strong leadership/partnerships, followed their white paper and/or road map, have the tech already rolled out or near completion (e.g. beta/trial phases), and that do not clash with fiat currencies, national governments budgets/security, central banks, &amp; Wall Street. We all research and argue our picks until we agree on a single crypto worth backing. Out of all the ALTs being traded, the only one I have confidence in to do extremely well in the next 2-3 years before the market corrects/bursts (barring an unexpected collapse or actions by outside national actors) is: VeChain (VEN). IOTA and XRP have already had their price spikes and will need to solve some issues on their end to see any further gains IMO (e.g. IOTA - potential security vulnerability with Tangle tech identified by MIT &amp; BU; XRP - financial institutions adopting Ripple's tech but not Ripple's XRP tokens, etc.). Both XRP and IOTA may go up further in price with new partnership announcements/agreements, but that is essentially a waiting game &amp; unknown at this time (although I tend to like IOTA more than XRP unless XRP makes some major inroads in implementation/adaption of its XRP token system); therefore, I like to put my money into what I believe is the safest play. For me, VeChain (VEN) is an undervalued crypto that will significantly increase in value once they have their re-branding/re-launch event on 2/26/2018 and VEN is allowed to announce more of their partners/clients after existing NDAs expire. Walton (WTC) and WaBi (WABI) are VENs competitors, and arguably have better tech in some negligible areas; however, in my investment view, your tech doesnt matter unless you have partners and clients willing to push/implement your product for mainstream/corporate adoption. Think LaserDisc vs DVD, BetaMax vs. VHS, etc. In the end, it wasn't necessarily the better tech that won out, but the tech that had better partners/clients that led to mass adoption by users. Based on the foregoing, VEN is the favorite to win out in this specialized area based solely on VENs partnerships/clients that we do know about: (1) PwC; (2) Renault in conjunction/coordination with Microsoft and Viseo; (3) DNV GL; (4) Kuehne &amp; Nagel; (5) China Unicom; (6) Direct Imported Goods ; &amp; (7) Billionaire Jim Breyer of Breyer Capital and his major soft power connections/network. PwC is one of the worlds Big 4 accounting firms; however, PwC does much more than accounting. A significant portion of PwCs business is consulting and there is no better partner than a Big 4 consultant to help push/market your new tech to its corporate clients. PwC has a piece of VEN and will push for it to become the global standard in this cyrpto arena. Renault is a French auto manufacturer that is part of the RenaultNissanMitsubishi Alliance, which is the fourth-largest automotive group in the world. VeChain coordinated with the tech giants Microsoft and Viseo in conjunction with its partnership with Renault. Kuehne &amp; Nagel is the worlds largest freight company, accounting for 10% of the worlds air and sea freight business. DNV GL is an international accredited registrar and classification company headquartered in Norway that does the bulk of the worlds classification of organic foods. Direct Imported Goods (DIG) is Chinas largest importer of fine wines. China Unicom is a Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator that is the worlds third largest telecommunications company by subscription base. The is not even a complete list of VEN partnerships (e.g. pharmaceutical partners, cold storage partners, Chinese government, etc.), which speaks volumes to the major business connections VEN already has backing it. You can buy VEN on Binance. I figured I'd let you know this now while it's still early to get in. Unlike IOTA &amp; XRP, VEN's market cap is still relatively low, which means that once investors find this gem it may spike and spike fast. As always, enter the market at your own risk and I could be completely wrong so do not invest solely based on my advice/recommendation. I've researched this thoroughly, but feel free to research VEN yourselves. I've put links to resources/references below in case you want a preliminary background into the VEN crypto.

111,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,"The story behind USD $1,000,000 hack and people greed.",23,7r6dgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r6dgh/the_story_behind_usd_1000000_hack_and_people_greed/,2018-01-18 13:08:52,"I want to share with you a real story that happened to me at the beginning of this year. I came across a rather significant vulnerability, which allowed me to get full access to a PC where more than a million dollars worth of cryptocurrency was being stored in unencrypted form and without any protection. I say ""came across"" because I had no intention of hacking into this computer. Circumstances left the door open to me. A user revealed the IP address of the potential victim to the public on one of the hacker forums. According to him, there was something important on this computer. First of all I would like to make it absolutely clear that I usually do not do such things, because I am an ethical (white hat) hacker. I look for vulnerabilities on a voluntary basis or for a fee in order to improve the security of the Internet and local networks. For the sake of interest, I decided to scan this IP address and, if possible, to break into this PC before any real intruders were able to. I found an open port through which I could connect via RDP. The rest was child's play: using brute-force attack method I was able to crack a users password who was authorized to log in using RDP. At first glance it seemed that I had hacked into a fairly ordinary office PC at a dentist's office. There was nothing super important here that would interest others: business correspondence, patient exam results, and bank statements. But just as I was about to write to them about the vulnerability in their network, I found an installed copy of TeamViewer with a logged-in user. That's when things became quite interesting. Out of the small list of active PCs, I found one that interested me. I managed to log into it without any problems. It turned out that the owner of this PC had been using it to store cryptocurrency. I found a Litecoin Core program there with an unencrypted wallet (with no password protection) containing LTC 4040 (worth over USD 1 million at the time of the hack), two-factor authentication data (including QR code with a secret key), and passwords to all of the exchanges including Bitstamp, Coinbase, and Quadriga where the PC owner had registered an account. The PC owner had also deposited additional savings on these exchanges, including 1200 XRP on Bitstamp. In addition, I found hundreds of saved passwords to other services (banks, payment systems, and online stores etc) in his browser. After discovering all of this, I broke out into a cold sweat and a shiver went up my spine. I could with one click of the button and without any restrictions transfer at a minimum all of his LTC, which was worth more than USD 1,000,000 at that time according to the exchange rate. I do not understand how people could store such amounts of money without taking proper security measures, such as a hardware wallet at the very least. It's very difficult to resist such a temptation, believe me. But I decided not to touch anything. I created a text file on his desktop, in which I described how he (as it turned out later, his wife at work) had serious vulnerabilities in his network configuration that would allow intruders to access his system from the outside. I wrote him detailed recommendations about how he could eliminate these vulnerabilities. In the same message I also told him how he could protect his cryptocurrency savings. In the end I wrote that if he would like to, he could donate me as a thank-you for such a HUGE help. I left him my wallet information and my e-mail address for communication, and then I logged off his PC. A day later I received 2 LTC (~USD 500) in my wallet. I also received a message from him, in which he was not very quick to thank me. He started to ask me for more details. I gave him a little bit more additional advice and wrote that I was surprised at his lack of gratitude given that I had saved him from losing his savings of more than USD 1 million and most importantly the damage to his nervous system that would have resulted if he had suffered such a loss. After a little more correspondence he reluctantly sent me another 10 LTC and then stopped communicating with me at all. I received a total of about USD 3000. I then made a calculation at the current exchange rate, and I found out that this amount represented only 0.29% of the amount that he had stored in LTC. There you have it: human gratitude. Frankly, I expected more words of gratitude in his letter and a more generous fee for the service that I did for him. For any bug bounty program, the payment for discovering a vulnerability that could lead to such damage would have been several times greater. Indeed, the tips that waiters receive for their service at a restaurant represent a greater percentage of the bill. This is already the second week that I have experienced doubts about whether I made the right decision. After such a display of ingratitude your mind tends toward evil thoughts, and you start to think that it would have been better if you stole the money. However, I still think that from the moral point of view such an action would have been wrong."

For this, i'm heavily favoring using my old iphone 7+ as an all-around solution for cold storing some of my longer positions. Now that Monero X wallet is available on IOS I think its time to migrate over. My biggest concern is risks inherent in having these wallets still ""connected"" to the internet intermittently when I decide to transfer something and turn on the wifi. Furthermore, I'm concerned about potential exploits that bring the phone online even though wifi is disconnected. Perhaps i've had a few too many swigs of the Mcaffee kool aid, but I believe the concerns about phones being online when they're supposed to be offiline are real. My other big concern is the device updating spontaneously. I can turn all this off, but if updates come down the pipe to the wallets and i'm forced to update the IOS, I could potentially lose all the apps and be forced to retrieve everything with seeds which is a gigantic pain in the ass. Does anyone else run into this? Finally, is there any vulnerability through iTunes if I back up the contents of the phone? As in, could someone theoretically hack my itunes and then get into the wallet even though it's ""on"" the phone? Forgive me if any of this sounds retarded, i'm still not 100% on assets being ""on"" a device versus just on the blockchain."

This question is a potentially deep one and one that I find captivating, with its answer burried in the quickly developing cryptocurrency landscape. It is true that nothing is certain in this future. Bitcoin could reach one million, maintaining it's hold as the main trading pair; it could stagnate in the transaction scaling issues which grow more prominent, necessitating in the diversification of trading pairs and commercially accepted cryptocurrencies; or one of the infinite combinations between. One thing that is certain about our future is as the total market cap grows, governments and institutions in positions of power are going to want to put their hands into the game in order to control or regulate so that they can get a piece of what they believe is theirs. Now rules and regulations are not something I claim to be an expert in so I won't attempt to speak to them but I know one thing, governments love their money and they will not stand idly by watching this market make tremendous profits for many involved and not want a piece. They fear not having control over something so powerful and lucrative. We see this already with the IRS requesting Coinbase to hand over information on users ([link](URL and the Department of Defense sending memos requesting assistance in the research of stealth addresses, ring signatures and Cryptonote (Monero, Aeon) code in general ([link](URL These are the whispers in the wind of what is coming. They want to be able to see and monitor what people have and where it is going. Private and fungible cryptocurrency makes the surveillance obsessed state sweat. So what does this mean? Large scale blockchain analysis to link address ownership to you, tracking not only wealth but where that money goes? Mandatory reporting of trade history if Coinbase reports your purchasing (which would also reveal your addresses if you send directly to it)? I am not sure what the form this increased scrutiny will bring. The important part is that public blockchains (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and many more) make these things possible. Now public blockchains aren't going anywhere because many people don't care about their freedom and privacy as we have seen with the whole net neutrality fiasco and the many government leaks concerning surveillance. But what happens as cryptocurrencies continue to grow, regulations are passed, the wealth of many of you grow to the point that governments become interested you? These are a few (but very important) reasons there will be a massive growth in anonymous and private cryptocurrencies in the coming years of mass adoption. There are several coins touted as private and anonymous, but every one has some compromise or vulnerability, except one ([link](URL That one is also the only one that the DoD is sending memos about and the FBI has been unable to crack (AlphaBay take down. [Excerpt](URL [Link](URL Cryptonote cryptocurrencies. This really only pertained to Monero as the sole holder of the privacy throne. How much growth can we expect to see? Is it reasonable to assume that in the next years monero could get to the market cap of Ethereum, $60 billion, or 1/4 of Bitcoin's current market cap? If that becomes reality we would see $4,000 monero, a 11x increase from today's standing. This may be conservative and even happen by year end 2018. Now I said ""pertained"" earlier because there used to be only one viable Cryptonote currency. There have been others but nothing ever truly got off the ground. But there is currently life being breathed into [Aeon](URL a Cryptonote currency touting all the benefits of Monero (now and future) with more of a focus on easy of use and mobility with a lighter version of the same ASIC resistant Cryptonote algorithm. This is a risky investment now as work is still being done but if this is successful in what they have set out to accomplish, Aeon will be the Litecoin to Monero. They may also have a more symbiotic dynamic than the bitcoin-litecoin relationship. Aeon can serve as a test bed for new ideas for use in Monero and the similarity between the two may someday lead to atomic swap-like technology to help solve scaling issues that will undoubtedly arise in the growing usage of Monero like we currently see in Bitcoin. Again, it's still early but keep an eye on this one. It's hanging out around $50 million market cap which is like getting into Monero in mid 2016. And if Monero gets to the Ethereum levels mentioned above, Aeon would likely maintain a 1/10 value relationship and be around where Monero is today, $350 - $400, a 100x gain. So in my opinion, very cheap for a coin that no one can see how much you have or where it goes, not even the government. Just two cents that were getting a little heavy on my chest. -Rad Block Zen"

Quantstamp actually has a very important purpose. As you know there have been multiple hacks due to poorly written contracts, each hack costing millions of dollars to be lost and even causing Ethereum to fork. They are solving a real problem unlike many ICOs out their that sound ridiculous and seem completely unnecessary. Lets go in depth on the benefits of what Quantstamp aims to do... Quantstamp aims to audit smart contracts in an automatic, decentralized and transparent fashion. Benefits of automatic auditing: standardized less risk of human error faster and cheaper than humans, Benefits of decentralized auditing: If multiple parties must agree on the smart contracts security it makes it less likely a verifier who finds a bug will no disclose a bug to exploit it in the future.(Page 12 of white paper) Benefits of transparent auditing: Audit Reports on the Blockchain can be helpful to prove the smart contract was audited for counterparties of the contract. There can be insurance (either by Quantstamp themselves or a third-party) in the very unlikely case the audit manages to miss a vulnerability. They are also first-to-market to try to solve this problem. 2) Team Their team is phenomenal. Phd, Ex-amazon, Ex-samsung, Stanford, Waterloo, MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, etc To say their team is qualified would be an understatement. Furthermore, many of their team members specialize in SAT/SMT solvers. 3) Prototype They are not just a white paper ICO that will lose motivation when they get their fat post-ICO check. They have already put in the work as shown in their GitHub and request network audit and when youve already put in the work you are less likely to throw all that away. 4) Credibility Their first partner/customer was Request Network. If you dont know what they are, they are another ICO backed by Ycombinator. Ycombinator is a VC fund that has backed companies such as airbnb and coinbase. If request network trusts Quantstamp to audit their work, then in a loose indirect way Quantstamp has the support of Ycombinator in my opinion. 5) It's a Protocol Protocols have much more potential than apps. Read URL In the whitepaper they also mention the QSP (Quantstamp Protocol) will be blockchain-agnostic and will support languages other than Solidity and platforms other than Ethereum in the future. 6) Longer vesting period Quantstamp team members will have a vesting period of 3 years. Some ICOs only have a vesting period of 6 months The longer vesting period is more proof that team is in this for the long run.

The bug presumably also affects altcoin derivatives of Electrum such as Electron Cash. If you don't use Electrum or a derivative, then you are not affected and you can ignore this. &amp;nbsp; **Action steps:** 1. If you are running Electrum, **shut it down right this second**. 2. Upgrade to [3.0.4](URL (making sure to verify the PGP signature). &amp;nbsp; You don't necessarily need to rush to upgrade. In fact, in cases like this it can be prudent to wait a while just to make sure that everything is settled. The important thing is to not use the old versions. If you have an old version sitting somewhere not being used, then it is harmless as long as you do not forget to upgrade it before using it again later. &amp;nbsp; **If at any point in the past you:** - Had Electrum open with no wallet passphrase set; and, - Had a webpage open &amp;nbsp; Then it is possible that your wallet is already compromised. Particularly paranoid people might want to send all of the BTC in their old Electrum wallet to a newly-generated Electrum wallet. (Though probably if someone has your wallet, then they already would've stolen all of the BTC in it...) &amp;nbsp; This was just fixed hours ago. The Electrum developer (ThomasV on the forum, ecdsa on github) will presumably post more detailed info and instructions in the near future. &amp;nbsp; **Update 1:** If you had no wallet password set, then theft is trivial. If you had a somewhat-decent wallet password set, then it seems that an attacker could ""only"" get address/transaction info from your wallet and change your Electrum settings, the latter of which seems to me to have a high chance of being exploitable further. So if you had a wallet password set, you can reduce your panic by a few notches, but you should still treat this very seriously. &amp;nbsp; *Source: URL"

What is the progress. With pitiful low withdrawal limits and people having tough id submission problems we need it NOW. Yes etherdelta is good for ethereum tokens but even it has some centralized vulnerability as the recent dns attack showed. We really more. What is stopping a peer to peer incrementzl type auto sending program between matdhed addresses or something similiar? Yes there would be some trust but every trade between addresses could have set amount increment limits to limit losses if one address failed to release funds after a swap was initiated. Cant this work? Cant the same kind of peer to peer discovery that is used by magnet links to find music be used to accomplish this? For example: One person wants to trade 10 xcoin for 20 ycoin and provides a send and receive address. Another does the compatible opposite. The software front end they use is like bittorrent and sets a magnet link type thing with those parameters and then searches for matches. Once found a bell rings and the two users both hit their send buttons for the agreed upon increments dividing the total trade into whatever increments they agree. The front end would either trigger their own wallet software or incorporate wallet software. Perhaps they divide that trade in one hundred increments which is a small enough amount that if the other person fails to send an increment after they send their losses are minimal. Manually they would keep hitting their send buttons as each increment got confirmations on their received coins. Of course that would be programmed into the front end software and increments could actually be in the many thousands to limit risk to miniscule amounts. But it seems pretty simple to do. why isnt this happenijg? Edit:Many many have planned to do it. It just hasnt happened. Bittorrent software has been around for years. I dont know why it cant literally be modified to do this . Edit2: hereis one opensourcebittorrent front end called transmission. It would be betrerto have one with a completely open license and i dont know if this is one but URL Edit3 : here are more on github URL Edit4m why would programmers do this instead of some endless ico filled with empty endless never delivered promises?

But then we discussed further and realized if there was a critical vulnerability it would be insanely profitable to exploit it and never share it and very generous to expose it to the communities that it effects before anyone can take advantage.

I would like to start a serious discussion about IOTA and help people to get into it. Before that I'll contribute with what I know, most things that I will say will have a source link providing some base content. &amp;nbsp; The pros and cons that I heard a lot is listed below, I'll discuss the items marked with *. Pros * [No transaction fees](URL * [Scalability](URL * [No miners](URL * [Resistance to quantum computations](URL * [Offline transactions (partitioning)](URL * [Big team with specialized people](URL * [Non-profit entity recognised by the german govern](URL * Extending offices across the world ([Berlin](URL [Oslo](URL [Chicago](URL [Singapore](URL * [Partnerships with big companies](URL * Real use case applications* * [Hardware support](URL Cons * [Centralization](URL * [Worst wallet (v2.5.4) in cryptospace](URL * Not user-friendly yet ([address reuse](URL [reattach](URL [snapshots](URL * [Congested network](URL * No smart contracts *[yet](URL * No anonymity *[yet](URL * [Past vulnerability issues](URL * [Core code written in ternary](URL (is this a con?) * [Fake partnerships](URL &amp;nbsp; ### Scalability Many users claim that the network infinitely scales, that with more transactions on the network the faster it gets. This is *not entirely true*, that's why we are seeing the [network getting congested](URL (pending transactions) at the moment (12/2017). The network is composed by full-nodes (stores all transactions), each full-node is capable of sending transactions direct to the tangle. An arbitrary user can set a light-node (do not store all transactions, therefore a reduced size), but as it does not stores all transactions and can't decide if there are conflicting transactions (and other stuff) it needs to connect to a full-node (bitifinex node for example) and then request for the full-node to send a transaction to the tangle. The full-node acts like a bridge for a light-node user, the quantity of transactions at the same time that a full-node can push to the tangle is limited by its brandwidth. What happens at the moment is that there are few full-nodes, but more important than that is: **the majority of users are connected to the same full-node** basically. The full-node which is being used can't handle all the requested transactions by the light-nodes because of its brandwidth. If you are a light-node user and is experiencing slow transactions you need to manually select other node to get a better performance. Also, you need to verify that the minimum weight magnitude (difficulty of the Hashcash Proof of Work) is set to 14 at least. The network seems to be fine and *it scales*, but **the steps an user has to make/know are not friendly-user** at all. It's necessary to understand that the technology envolved is relative new and still in early development. Do not buy iota if you haven't read about the technology, there is a high chance of you losing your tokens because of various reasons and it will be your own fault. You can learn more about how IOTA works [here](URL There are some upcoming solutions that will bring the user-experience to a new level, [The UCL Wallet](URL (expected to be released at this month, will talk about that soon and how it will help the network) and the [Nelson CarrIOTA](URL (this week) besides the official implementations to come in december. &amp;nbsp; ### Centralization We all know that currently (2017) IOTA depends on the coordinator because the network is still in its infancy and because of that it is considered centralized by the majority of users. The coordinator are several full-nodes scattered across the world run by the IOTA foundation. It creates periodic Milestones (zero value transactions which reference valid transactions) which are validated by the entire network. The coordinator sets the general direction for the tangle growth. **Every node verifies that the coordinator is not breaking consensus rules by creating iotas out of thin air or approving double-spendings**, nodes only tells other nodes about transactions that are valid, if the Coordinator starts issuing bad Milestones, nodes will reject them. The coordinator is optional since summer 2017, you can choose not implement it in your full-node, any talented programmer could replace Coo logic in IRI with Random Walk Monte Carlo logic and go without its milestones right now. A new kind of [distributed coordinator](URL is about to come and then, for the last, its completely removal. You can read more about the coordinator [here](URL and [here](URL ####Mining-Blockchain-based Cryptocurrencies These are blockchain-based cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin) that has miners to guarantee its security. Satoshi Nakamoto states several times in the [Bitcoin whitepaper](URL that ""*The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes*"". We can see in Blockchain.info that nowadays half of the total hashpower in Bitcoin is controlled by 3 companies (maybe only 1 in the future?). Users must trust that these companies will behave honestly and will not use its 50%&gt; hashpower to attack the network eventually. With all that said **it's reasonable to consider the IOTA network more decentralized (even with the coordinator) than any mining-blockchain-based cryptocurrency** You can see a comparison between DAG cryptocurrencies [here](URL &amp;nbsp; ### IOTA partnerships Some partnerships of IOTA foundation with big companies were well known even when they were not officialy published. Some few examples of confirmed partnerships are listed below, others cofirmed partnerships can be seem in the link *Partnerships with big companies* at the pros section. * [Bosch](URL * [Volkswagen](URL * [Fujitsu](URL * [Innogy](URL * [Sopra Steria](URL * [Lattice80](URL So what's up with all alarming in social media about IOTA Foundation faking partnerships with big companies like Microsoft and Cisco? At Nov. 28th IOTA Foundation announced the [Data Marketplace](URL with 30+ companies participating. Basically it's a place for any entity sell data (huge applications, therefore many companies interested), at time of writing (11/12/2017) there is no API for common users, only companies in touch with IOTA Foundation can test it. A quote from Omkar Naik (Microsoft worker) depicted on the Data Marketplace blog post gave an idea that Microsoft was in a direct partnership with IOTA. Several news websites started writing headlines [""Microsoft and IOTA launches""](URL (The same news site claimed latter that IOTA lied about partnership with Microsoft) when instead Microsoft was just one of the many participants of the Data Marketplace. Even though it's not a direct partnership, IOTA and Microsoft are in close touch as seen in *IOTA Microsoft and Bosch [meetup](URL december 12th*, *Microsoft IOTA [meetup](URL in Paris 14th* and *[Microsoft Azure](URL adds 5 new Blockchain partners (may 2016)*. If you join the IOTA Slack channel you'll find out that there are many others big companies in close touch with IOTA like [BMW](URL [Tesla](URL and [other companies](URL This means that right now **there are devs of IOTA working directly with scientists of these companies to help them integrate IOTA on their developments even though there is no direct partnership published**, I'll talk more about the use cases soon. &gt; We are excited to partner with IOTA foundation and proud to be associated with its new data marketplace initiative... - Omkar Naik &amp;nbsp; ### IOTA's use cases Every cryptocurrency is capable of being a way to exchange goods, you pay for something using the coin token and receive the product. Some of them are more popular or have faster transactions or anonymity while others offers better scalablity or user-friendness. But none of them (except IOTA) are capable of transactioning information with no costs ([fee-less transactions](URL in an securely form ([MAM](URL and being sure that the [network will not be harmed when it gets more adopted](URL (scales). These characteristics open the gates for several real world applications, you probably might have heard of [Big Data](URL and how data is so important nowadays. &gt;Data sets grow rapidly - in part because they are increasingly gathered by cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices such as mobile devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks. &amp;nbsp; &gt; Its just the beginning of the data period. Data is going to be so important for human life in the future. So we are now just starting. We are a big data company, but compared to tomorrow, we are nothing. - [Jack Ma (Alibaba)](URL There are enormous quantities of wasted data, often [over 99% is lost to the void](URL that could potentially contain extremely valuable information if allowed to flow freely in data streams that create an open and decentralized [data lake](URL that is accessible to any compensating party. Some of the biggest corporations of the world are purely digital like Google, Facebook and Amazon. **Data/information market will be huge in the future and that's why there so many companies interested in what IOTA can offer**. There are several real world use cases being developed at the moment, many of them if successful will revolutionize the world. You can check below a list of some of them. * [Data Marketplace](URL (30+ companies developing their own project using IOTA) * [Bosch XDK device [1]](URL [[2]](URL * [Bosch presentation meetup and how is using IOTA tangle](URL * [IOTA Electric vehicle charging station by ELaad [1]](URL [[2]](URL [[3]](URL * [IOTA and its practical application in the automotive industry](URL * [NetObjex demonstrates decentralized smart parking solution with IOTA](URL * [Machine Tagging for Digital Twins by Innogy](URL * [Machine learning as a service by CognIOTA](URL * [Wechat group in China](URL (Alibaba, Amazon, xiaomi, ChinaTelecom, okex, USTC, CAS, BNU, SJTU envolved) * [SatoshiPay - IOTA pay per content proof of concept](URL Extra * [""IOTA in serious discussions with central banks to introduce e-currency"" - Former UBS CIO T. Bussmann](URL * [Worlds Largest Fintech on IOTA New Innovation Lab](URL * [IOTA Foundation has revolutionised IoT - Key Deutsche Bank Blockchain Report](URL These are just few examples, there are a lot more ongoing and [to explore](URL &amp;nbsp; ### IOTA Wallet (v2.5.4 below) For those who have read a lot about IOTA and know how it works the wallet is fine, but that's not the case for [most users](URL Issues an user might face if decide to use the current wallet: * [Connection refused](URL * [request error: invalid transaction hash](URL * [Pending transaction for days](URL * [Wallet not showing the correct balance](URL * [Headaches with snapshots](URL * Using a node that's down/slow * Not reattaching * Not having your wallet set up properly (min weight 14, etc.) Problems that could be easily avoided with a better understand of the network/wallet or with a better wallet that could handle these issues. As I explained before, some problems during the ""congestion"" of the network could be simply resolved if stuff were more user-friendly, this causes many users storing their iotas on exchanges which is not safe either. The upcoming ([dec 2017](URL UCL Wallet will solve most of these problems. It will switch between nodes automatically and auto-reattach transactions for example (besides other things). You can have full a overview of it [here](URL and [here](URL Also, the upcoming [Nelson CarrIOTA](URL will help on automatic peer discovery for users setup their nodes more easily. &amp;nbsp; ### IOTA Vulnerability issue On sept 7th 2017 a team from MIT reported a [cryptographic issue](URL on the hash function Curl. You can see the full response of IOTA members below. * [Curl disclosure, beyond the headline](URL * [CFB's response to Neha Narula's blogpost](URL * [Jeremy Epstein response Neha Narula's blogpost](URL Funds were never in danger as such scenarios depicted on the Neha's blogpost were not pratically possible and the arguments used on the blogpost had'nt fundamentals, all the history you can check by yourself on the responses.

Every time you spend iota from a address, part of the private key of that specific address is revealed. This makes easier for attackers to steal that address balance. Attackers can search if an address has been reused on the tangle explorer and try to brute force the private key since they already know part of it."
129,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Is IOTA massively overvalued?,197,77zpf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/77zpf0/is_iota_massively_overvalued/,2017-10-22 22:29:41,"I know the hype around IOTA is huge and many are invested into this project and might not like this opinion. I've done some research within the last days because I was planning to put some money into IOTA. Now I feel like the project is very overvalued. * The coordinator centralizes the whole network. It is currently under maintenance and the network is basically unusable. The only two exchanges which trade IOTA stopped withdrawals and deposits. No tangle explorer works anymore. The vast majority of full nodes doesn't work anymore. Some full nodes which don't connect to the coordinator are still up and running and as a result some people even say *look, this is great, that's a proof that the network works without the coordinator*. Uhm, no. First, the whole economy has stopped. You can't withdraw or deposit your IOTA to any exchanges. You can't use any tangle explorer anymore. Secondly, the reason why the coordinator exists in the first place is to protect against attacks while the network is too small to protect itself. So there is no way to say *that's the proof! it works without the coordinator* when a.) the economy stopped working and b.) the network is now insecure. * The wallet experience is awful. I often get errors on my Windows machine and on Ubuntu the wallet doesn't work at all. The mobile wallet also doesn't work for me. But the worst part is probably that due to how IOTA works, addresses must be re-attached to the tangle every now and then for the balance and transaction history to appear again. If you login to your wallet after some time, you will see it's completely empty and you need to manually restore your balance by re-attaching addresses. [Look at the GitHub issues](URL to see how many people complain about missing balances and even think the wallet is a scam. This wallet is a massive hurdle for regular users. * Tangle explorers also face the problem of re-organizations. If you received IOTA to an address some time ago, tangle explorers will not even recognize the address. * The developers reacted very unprofessional to some events in the past. When a [vulnerability in a hash function was found from a researcher](URL the devs first said *it wasn't even a vulnerability at all* and later changed their mind to *it was hidden by purpose to be able to attack other open source projects which copy it from IOTA*. [Here](URL Vitalik Buterin offered his criticism and the IOTA devs reacted rather defensive and accused him of a *sudden onslaught of cheap immature attacks*. Well, read the thread if you want and make up your own mind. * The project is very young and because it's the first DAG based crypto, the game theoretical implications of the network are still unclear and there might be yet unknown attack vectors. All of this might change in the future but currently that's the state of the project. I know that zero fees and scalability are very strong arguments and that's also the reason I am very interested in the project. But where the project currently stands, a $1 billion valuation seems insane to me. And I'm feeling uncomfortable when I browse /r/Iota and see the amount of people who blindly believe in the success of the project while dismissing any sort of criticism. Let me know what you think, is the valuation of the project justified? Do you think it is sustainable? Do you see the moon coming closer? "

Hence, I decided to do our part and put together certain pieces to figure out what Quantstamp exactly is and how it could benefit the blockchain community. Projects are only as good as the people bringing them to market, so lets look at their team. Quantstamp has combined some of the FINEST people on their team which got massive past experiences with companies like Phd, Ex-amazon, Ex-samsung, Stanford, Waterloo, MIT, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, etc Leading the team is Richard Ma, their Co-founder &amp; the CEO of the company. It is followed by Steven Stewart, who too is Co-founder &amp; CTO while Edward Zulkoski, VajihMontaghami and PritSheth are leading the Engineering department. Anna Kao, the youngest member of the team is handling Graphics &amp; UX Designer. Krishna Sriram is the Community Manager/PR, and last but not the least is Meg VanDeventer, who is the head of communications. So, with such capable team, Quantstamp future looks in safe hands. Quantstamp has the [roadmap] (URL in place that runs to October, 2018 with an aim to be the first Ethereum Killer app. They aim to audit smart contracts in an automatic, decentralized and transparent fashion. The benefits that can be seen of automatic auditing are standardized, lowering the risk of human error, faster, effective and cheaper than humans! Meanwhile, benefits of transparent auditing too are not to be ignored. As the Audit Reports on the Blockchain can be helpful to prove the smart contract was audited for counterparties of the contract. With possibility of the insurance (either by Quantstamp themselves or a third-party) in the very unlikely case the audit manages to miss a vulnerability. The Quantstamp protocol is a scalable system to audit all projects on Ethereum. 100% of contributions go towards developing the Quantstamp protocol and there are no individual caps for the presale, early adopters allow the hiring of engineers For the main sale, there are individual caps and partnering with a leading KYC provider and unsold tokens are burned. Tokens for the founding team are on a 3 year vesting schedule. Final words about Quantstamp When we started this short analysis, there were a lot of answers to be figured out about this, but now all seems to be clear, therefore, it makes us feel that Quantstamp is very crucial part of the industry, it will be absolutely be in demand. So, our makeup of this is great and it is going to be the core part of the Blockchain community in years to come! "

136,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Why do people prefer the upgraded Bitcoin Cash over Bitcoin Segwit? Here's the reasons.,0,7byhl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7byhl3/why_do_people_prefer_the_upgraded_bitcoin_cash/,2017-11-10 14:11:04,"Ever since Bitcoin had an upgrade into Bitcoin Cash on 1st August 2017, I have been bullish for Bitcoin Cashs long term future. As follows are my personal opinions on why I feel Bitcoin Cash is the future of digital cash over the legacy Bitcoin. Better Security  Bitcoin has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. Improved Scalability  Bitcoin is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 8x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle Visa/Mastercard transactions volume in the future with another upgrade. Supply Scarcity  During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than the legacy Bitcoin. Improved Confirmation Times  Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old legacy Bitcoin, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized. Low Fees  One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of Bitcoin, fees have reached as much as $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries. At the moment, the old legacy Bitcoin has network effects advantages just like how Friendster used to dominate the social networking space. Since Bitcoin Cash was only out for 2 months, it would remain to be seen how much time would be needed to play catch up. It took Facebook years to catch up to Friendsters dominance back then and it may take Bitcoin Cash just as long to achieve the same. Source: URL"

The first one is an automated and upgradeable software verification system that checks and vets Smart Contracts. The second method is to reward white hackers for spotting and reporting vulnerabilities to the developers in a bounty reward program. A great case study will be the parity wallet hack, where without the help of white hackers, $150 million dollars more of Ethers would have been stolen. With the bounty reward program, hackers will actually have an incentive to report the bug, and not hack the vulnerability, especially when they are working in a group. This is very nicely put across by Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma in [this presentation](URL You can jump to 5:48 in the video for the explanation of their use of the Prisoner's Dilemma. **Conclusion** Security is the first and foremost consideration for investors and users alike. However, not enough has been done to secure Smart Contracts at this point of time. With the introduction of Quantstamp, that is now possible and we, as a community, should do whatever we can to support this project, and push Smart Contracts a step further towards the mainstream. "

I dont mean to offend anyone, but just when reflecting on the recent Ethereum lottery hacking deal, fees, markets opening amd closing, etc, there is so much screaming about what is ""fair"" or appropriate. From my perspective, though, is that this is shit that SHOULD be expected in this market. The entire decentralized idea lends itself to vulnerability and volatility. Everyone is so quick to yell ""SCAM!!"", but hey, the system creates this. Its a fundamental byproduct of this crypto world to have sketchy practices popping up. There are no regulations and everyone seems to embrace that....until they get burned! As for fees, do people really just expect confirmations for free? Time and money is spent by real people to build the infrastructure and commissions are needed. Prices may get crazy at times, but again, thats part of this system that we are embracing. World stock markets charge $5 and up per trade. Its nothing new. As a society, I feel we have taken banks for granted. Sure, they are money gribbing theives....but the kept our fiat safe (all things considered) and created a system to easily exchange fiat for goods and such. For us to effectively upend all of that to create a decentralized world, we need to not get so up in arms about losing some of the luxuries that have been provided to us traditionally"

Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Research Have Never Been So Easy,20,75vj5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/75vj5x/new_ico_project_for_white_hat_hackers_penetration/,2017-10-12 18:55:53,"The world of today is developing incredibly fast. The variety of new technologies and processes have advanced in different regions of the world on a regular basis. Theyre from different fields and industries and serve unique purposes. However, innovations have one thing in common - all of them need safety of personal information and program code. If this requirement is violated, no company would be able to survive. Cyber Security Market Advancements The role of cyber security market has become extremely important under these circumstances. Its played a role of the most crucial industry and works as infrastructure for all other businesses. In turn, the internal development of the market has never been more expected. Everyone knows the proverb - New Times Call for New Measures. Meet Hacken - the first platform and cryptocurrency of the same name, which is custom-tailored to satisfy the needs of the cyber security market. The main characteristics of it are decentralization, liquidity, and anonymity thanks to the application of the best suited technology for these purposes - blockchain. Within the offered functions, this technology would assist the company in coping with all the challenges of the industry. It would help achieve the highest level of security for a startup and assist the white hat hackers in their desire to work in an ethical key by providing high compensation and total anonymity for them. The cyber security market would obviously benefit from the application of blockchain technology, especially accounting for the fact that the cryptocurrency would be created taking into consideration all the peculiarities and needs of the market. Hacken Influence on the Market The creation of Hacken framed a priority goal for the company and industry in general. The company aims to contribute to the development of the cyber-security market and promote the idea of being a white hat hacker. To ensure the achievement of this noble goal, the company designed some products, which are integrated within the Hacken ecosystem. Hacken Proof The first component to assure the implementation of the cyber security market changes and improvements is the Hacken Proof platform. It will offer white hat hackers a range of projects so that theyll be able to participate in vulnerability and penetration testing of various companies. The competitive advantage of this bug bounty platform would be total anonymity. Neither customers nor clients would be able to reach each other or harm in any means. All the operations on the platform would be delivered in exchange for HKNs only, which would help frame the industry and its future growth. More information about the policies and participation prospects are available via this link URL Hacken Accelerator However, the single company would not be able to frame and achieve all the goals, stated above. Thats the main reason why Hacken is willing to create another product, the Hacken Accelerator. This would be the place where the best initiatives in the cyber security field are to be supported by Hacken and its marketing team. The first participants would be announced during the Annual HackIT conference, which would be assessed below. Its also noteworthy that all the operations and funds of the Hacken Accelerator would also be in HKNs. As a result, young and bright talent will be able to bring their ideas to fruition regardless of any stiff competition and a lack of funds. HackIT Conference The support of the market by searching for and preparing the best professionals of cybersecurity is also a top priority for Hacken, which would help frame the industry and its further development. Thats why the company is supporting the biggest cybersecurity conference in Eastern Europe. During late September, teams from all around the world would compete in the CTF event, sponsored and supported by Hacken. Additionally, the best hackers will be hired by Hacken while their ideas would gain support and investments from within the Hacken Accelerator. Does the Community Really Need It? The question of the necessity of Hackens existence in the industry is being debated by a plethora of people. The company sees its goal and is willing to transfer it onto others. Its promoting the idea of ethical hacking and making the world more secure in terms of use of the Internet. Hacken supports the values of protecting businesses from hack attacks and getting bounties for this. The usage of blockchain technology would make it easier for the industry to achieve this objective. In turn, anonymity would help white hat hackers do their work and remain safe. However, the Hacken company is not only useful for the community. Accounting for the constant trend of growth in the industry, its obvious that investing in the Cyber Security market would also be beneficial. The use of blockchain technology makes it far easier for Hacken to find possible investors. An ICO of the company enables other people to vote with their capital and support the market by investing in HKNs. The presale of them has already started. The main sale will last until the end of November. The initial exchange rate with fiat money is 1 HKN=1 USD. More information can be found in the Whitepaper of Hacken. In turn, IT companies and other forms using IT products for their operations would also get advantages from being part of the Hacken ecosystem as clients. They would be able to acquire access to the extremely high amount of white hat hackers, whose task is to provide premium quality penetration and vulnerabilities testing. The competitive advantage of Hacken for clients is that a number of participants of the testing would be random and adequately high. All of them would remain anonymous and unaware of all the other participants of the testing process. In addition, all bugs identified will become the property of the customer. Thus, it will be protected by Hacken policy. All these facts will ensure the highest results and safety for the client. In general, the cyber security industry is currently facing constant changes and challenges . Hacken offers a viable framework and tools which would be helpful in remaining competitive and safe in this ever changing environment. The company offers a new point of view on cybersecurity and white hat hacking. Its aimed at supporting the other projects in the sphere to achieve its goal  making the world a safer and better place.

Token sales with fixed prices and/or caps quickly sell out generally to a small number of (usually wealthy) speculators and leave little room for anyone else.

150,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Agrello Tokensale Review,6,6p0qq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6p0qq1/agrello_tokensale_review/,2017-07-23 20:59:16,"A long time lurker and first time ICO buyer. I have looked at 20+ ICO's before Agrello. URL First and foremost, I want to make clear that public blockchains are in my opinion the best projects for most people interested in crypto-assets to participate in. So-called ICOs, token sales, token distribution events, token generation events, token crowdsales are risky value props. They are not for the faint of heart. They are not for the naive. There are a million new startups, generally speaking, every day. By a wide margin most of these will go bankrupt. Similarly, when it comes to token sales, same thing. I am sure we will see a lot of failed projects, lots of disgruntled token holders. When you participate in a token sale, it is like giving money to, say, Skype in its earliest days, before telecommunication was even a thing. A share in a piece of software. Thats what a token represents. In the case of Skype, if it had a native token like Kik messenger plans to introduce, it is likely those early participants would have done quite well on their token holdings. But for every Skype there are innumerable failed software projects. When participating in a token sale, it is important you believe in the stated mission, the team, the technological philosophy and the roadmap. In sifting through dozens of white papers and looking at project histories, there are many promising projects. One that stuck out was Agrello. I was mostly impressed by Chief Scientist Alex Nortas long history publishing at University of Tallinn on digital contracting and smart contracting. Norta credits Ethereum with bringing the notion of digital contracting and smart contracting to the mainstream. Besides Nortas long history publishing on digital contracts and teaching at the University of Tallinn, Agrellos history of open-mindedness in experimenting on various platforms peaked my attention - mostly that it had developed on Rootstock and explored using Bitcoin on its system. While it seems the team has opted to build on Ethereum mainly (ERC20 standard), the project has also looked at various other platforms, including NEO (formerly AntShares). It has been able to do this thanks to the strong programming talent on its development team. The Idea Agrello is building a smart contract system using its self aware contracts technology. As the project states in its white paper: Agrello enables blockchain-driven self-aware agents-assisted contracts for a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) economy. More from the white paper: In [conventional contracts], a lawyer has to look at a contract to check if a deadline was missed, or an obligation breached. Self-awareness in this sense means that both entities, the [conventional contracts] and lawyer, merge into one artifact being a software agent that comprises contract logics in the form of machine-readable obligations. More precisely, the agent can deduce, e.g., missed deadlines from the obligations, and since we perceive the agent with the obligations as a smart contract, we conclude a smart contract reasons about itself. In short, Self aware contracts use machine learning and agent technology in order to allow a contract to be aware of its state throughout the lifecycle of the contract. A peer to peer community of lawyers will create and review templates, and receive payment for doing so in Agrellos native token DELTA, which users can then use for rental agreements and various other types of legal agreements. The way in which Agrello clearly combines multiple technologies together intrigues me, as well. This is not a blockchain only initiative. The Agrello tech is designed to use various technologies, which contract relationship data located off-chain, but hashed on-chain the moment an agreement is initiated. That some data is stored off-chain allows for contracts to be edited over their lifecycle. That Agrello has spent time on the oracle problem, which afflicts blockchains that seek to do important stuff in the real world, led me to consider their project to be a sophisticated one. Basically, there can exist decentralized points in certain blockchain systems that serve as a point of vulnerability. Instead of using centralized oracles that dont scale, Agrello uses compost oracles where agents represent collaborating parties and agents are responsible to channel trusted information into the contract. Full disclosure: My main interest in Agrello dates all the way back to an Ask Me Anything they did last week. URL I tuned in for the first half and came away feeling like the team was professional, experienced and earnest, at least. (which is a lot to say for this space) A conversation right away was of particular interest. Agrello explained its platform as using technology to allow for contracts to be read by machines. Beneath the coding mumbo jumbo, there is plain English (or plain whatever-language-a-jurisdiction-accepts) that can be read by humans and printed out. Using agents, Agrello is able to program rights and obligations (hashed onto a blockchain) into their self-aware contracts via a declarative programming language called AgrelloLanguage. The code declares that parties must complete tasks by deadlines, enjoy certain rights, and assigns actions when obligations or conditions have been met. (or not) Like other token sales - namely, Civic - Agrello features a strong digital identity component to make it easy to sign digital documents. DELTA allows lawyers and legal professionals on the platform to design templates and earn money. In turn, users can buy templates to use in their contract endeavors with the token. In the abovementioned AMA, I particularly liked a segment in which Norta detailed his vision. The idea behind Agrello is to take the tedious work away from users, and let users and organizations collaborate in a peer-to-peer fashion, and allow them to focus on more decision making and creative work. And really all the repetitive, annoying work is offloaded to the smart contract and agents. And thereby you take care of the information and value transfer logistics that are involved. Value transfer logistics can very quickly explode in terms of cost and time needed. So, if you lock that off into a smart contract, you are definitely saving a lot. It is possible to build into smart contracts definitions, exceptions, management and compensation procedures. When certain things go wrong, then this exception-compensating mechanism can take care of that. And the idea then is really you have agents on top to engage in dispute resolution and negotiate and engage in a socio-technical way with humans involved in final decisions, if that is wished, to basically resolve conflicts. And actually, in the white paper, I give reference for precisely such an approach which I published about in a journal paper in an article about conflict management and using smart contracts and agents. Conclusion: Agrello is designed to process enough logistics to execute legally-binding, real world contracts. The project takes a social-technical approach and expects that, when certain decisions or certain tasks must be completed, humans will play a role. By incorporating agent technology, Agrello from its offices in Estonia might achieve the flexibility required to deal with the complexity involved in bringing smart contracts to life. Founder Alex Norta coined the term self-aware contracts to describe the Agrello iteration of smart contracting as described above, which could be considered a Smart Contract 2.0 concept. What are your thoughts on the tech behind self-aware contracts?"

152,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,"The first real free market is about to open, get your coins while the price is low ! #ShadowProject #SDC",1,5zs6kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/5zs6kc/the_first_real_free_market_is_about_to_open_get/,2017-03-17 05:02:25,"Ive written this article because i think there is a HUGE deal to be made with this crypto-currency and a large interest as far as it concerns DNM (dark net markets) and maybe commerce in general. I will expose several points of why I think SDC (ShadowCoin) is largely undervalued at this time. And it should move fast so you may invest before it goes up. 1. You just have to observe the current tendency of alt coin like Ether / Monero / DASH / Z.Cash etc. They all gain in value a lot because more and more people are joining the blockchain revolution and obviously, they want their piece of the cake. Bitcoin is kind of the tip of the iceberg and just a very singular experiment with the blockchain that went very well. It could stay a strong asset, like the digital gold. In fact, bitcoins is currently used as the main currency to exchange alt coins. If it stays that way it could be a good thing to keep some in the long term. Besides, there is a lot of concerns about bitcoin. As this article from techcrunch points out, transactions with bitcoin are getting slower and slower, the cost in electricity is rising and its certainly not anonymous . Thats the main reason why the alt coin that focus on anonymity and effective usage (buy things in a timely manner) are draining more and more interest. 2. Monero / DASH / Z.Cash, there is right now a lot of competition and still those crypto-currency are holding a lot of value. Just look at DASH - which stand for Digital Cash -. Its current value is 90$. Formerly it was called DarkCoin. As it name sound, it was focusing more in anonymity and the darkest side of the web (and so the dark net market) because we all know that the effective usage nowadays of the cryptocurrency go mainly to the DNM. The founder/developper of DarkCoin/Dash, Evan Duffield tried to acquire the shadow project back in 2014 because he has seen its potential. Their pivoting as a mainstream / alternative approach to bitcoin was a right call, the market show right now that there is a huge demand for a money that enable fast transfer and also guaranty your anonymity. But this pivoting also leave an open breach for a crypto-currency that is tailored specifically for the DNM. 3. Because facts speak louder than words, lets have a look of the current implementation of the shadow coin (SDC) compared to other crypto-currency. You can see that SDC is overall superior to all crypto that currently exists, especially if you focus on privacy and intractability. You can have a deeper look on how transaction ShadowSend work with this slideshow. 4. One of the feature your probably dont know yet is the proof of stake. Its right now one of the rare crypto that handle this protocol. Contrary to bitcoin and other crypto that are based on the protocol of proof of work you dont need to own a super-computer and pay huge bills of electricity to gain more coins. This system is made so that the more you possess SDC, the more you gain (2% / 4%). Since you leave your SDC in the wallet, you help the system work (by staking your coins) and so you receive your share of 2%/4% more of what you own in SDC, that without mining. You can do that just with a notebook as it is not demanding in processing power. Just imagine the gain if you compare to bitcoin. No need to tumble your bitcoins on platform like Grams Helix which is rather slow, subject to scam with phishing address and ask 3% of fee which is a damn lot. 5. No you could say, Great but what about Monero, its already used in AlphaBay and it guaranty anonymity. First, lest say that this currency is as secure as they claim, right. The reason of this thread is not devaluate Monero, its a valuable currency but some recent events points out that there is some flaws on how the development of this crypto is handled. Their official wallet work with command lines, so its definitely not the best UX (User Experience), while the other wallet with a proper GUI (Graphic User Interface) are definitely not secured . Monero was created in April 2014 while the Shadow Project was created on July 2014. The reason why its not currently valuated like Monero is simply because the team of developper is not bragging about their project for short term income. They are working hard to provide not only the best security there is to hold and exchange currency but also build a whole platform that works in the same ecosystem and is both extremely secure and easy to use. 6. Here is the most important point, their software Umbra, available in Windows / Linux / Mac (and soon to be released in IOS and Android) is a dream come true for the future of DNM. The interface of the software is very sleek. In fact I havent seen anything like that as far as it concerns a blockchain technology (except Ethereum). While Im at ease with the use of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) I think it could really democratise the usage of DNM. Everything that you need to do is to buy some SDC and download the soft, everything that you do inside the soft stays anonymous and leave absolutely no trace (just a shadow as they say). The interface Umbra is by far the best one with future integration of the anonymous and decentralised market that is a real milestone since a lot of DNM have been shutdown by law enforcement (Silk Road etc.). Or because of exit-scam (Sheep Market etc) and recently the disappearance of Oasis Marketplace that generated a fall of Monero value. Imagine a market place, completely decentralised, so unstoppable, that would drain a massive amount of fiat money (euro / dollars / yen, you name it). Combined with the proof of stake that encourages the holder not to sell in a rush, I let you imagine how much it could be worth the following years ! Just have a look at this roadmap ;) ! 7. So now lets talk about money $_$!. Here and now its relatively underground because you can buy it only on 3 markets (Poloniex / Bittrex / Shapeshift). Its pretty obvious what will happen as soon as it will be adopted by big exchange places like kraken or Coinbase or even by DNM like Alphabay Still its value is fairly high for a relatively unknown crypto-currency. Also, in term of number of SDC (~6.5M), its equivalent to DASH (~7M) which is evaluated currently at ~99$ and half of the number of Monero (12 Millions coins) which is worth right now ~19$. If you follow the law of offer and demand its a really good indicator of what it could worth very shortly. 8. Now you can see that SDC is better than bitcoin in all aspects, not only in term of anonymity but also of transaction speed and block size. You can notice that the bitcoin withdrawal are very slow these days. Thats because the bitcoin blockchain can process only 7 transactions/seconds. While it tends to evolve (~1 transaction/seconds last year) its still too slow for a more a more intense usage. Right now its taking ~3 hours to do a simple withdraw You shouldnt neglect the fact that there is a big trust/lobby behind this. For instance, the bitcoin foundation is behind CoinDesk , trying to influence the value of bitcoin to gain more and more money. In fact, bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg that is the blockchain. Ethereum is far more interesting for a lot of usages (its just missing the killer app) and you should definitely invest in it also and diversify your assets. 9. The last point would be, if you are still not convinced to invest, the 17th of March 10.am CTM the team behind the shadow project will make an announcement. There plan is to release the marketplace this year. While we cant be sure that they will open it right now, I guess that they will announce great news that will definitely draw more interest (and investors). I have no link with the team behind ShadowCoin. I just learned about it a month ago and Im really excited about this new environment and I think there is big money to be made, thats why Im sharing this.

Because we take these claims seriously, we investigate each one, but almost all of them turn out to be fake with the sole purpose of extorting us. In the event that someone comes to us with a legitimate matter, we pay a bounty and part ways with a professional understanding that as long as we promptly fix the issue, the matter is considered closed. Now we are witnessing someone reporting a vulnerability, getting paid for it, then publishing his 'findings' to suggest that we are negligent and irresponsibly running an exchange. At that point we have to question the motivation for publishing in an open forum. Initially, it may appear as though this person is trying to provide a service to the community, but if his story is a mash-up of half-truths and inaccuracies, what is he really after? We grasp the need to sensationalize to gain some publicity, even if it's short-lived, baseless, and nothing more than a stunt to get some attention, but we prefer facts, so let's lay them out. -- Poloniex had a vulnerability in early 2014 that led to an exploit (our longstanding customers know about this event well, and they also know that we [repaid those who were affected](URL We overhauled our system in response to this exploit. How can we back this up? There hasn't been a similar exploit since. -- Anyone who is familiar with web services should know that multithreading, in and by itself, is not a vulnerability. In fact, it is necessary when processing more than one request at any given time. Our trading engine processes 200-300 transactions per second, and that's on a slow day. -- For those who may be concerned with us using GET in any context: We agree that POST is best practice, and we currently use POST for sensitive information. We have plans to move more requests to POST, but in the meantime, its worth noting that GET is not inherently insecure and POST is not inherently secure. What matters much more is how each is used. -- There was a legitimate bug discovered where an Attacker could modify a redirect URL and potentially trick a recipient to click it and get redirected to a different domain. This was brought to our attention, a bounty was paid, niceties were exchanged, and a fix was promptly deployed. -- This same person then found another client-side exploit where he could alter the style of his Trollbox name to resemble the color of a moderator. Despite what has been falsely reported, he did not gain moderator privileges. Still, we would have considered this a bounty-worthy bug, but rather than report this to us, he decided it would be a spectacular idea to go into the Trollbox and flaunt what he had found. He was quickly banned, and a fix for this bug was implemented in a matter of minutes. Should a 'security review' of a company by an unknown, unidentifiable person be trusted without asking the question - what is his objective? Should a 'news source' that eagerly publishes the statements of a person without verifiable identity or proper vetting of his accusations be considered legitimate news? It is unfortunate that the document published today got any traction at all, but perhaps these types of discrediting tactics by those with unknown motives should be brought to light and discussed more openly. Our hope is that this isn't now a new thing where all it takes is for someone to make some claims, slap a Company logo on a word doc, and call it a ""Security Review"" to get some cheap attention at the expense of others.

154,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Ethereum vs Emercoin - The Difference of Approach Between Blockchains,3,4rfhqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/4rfhqe/ethereum_vs_emercoin_the_difference_of_approach/,2016-07-06 09:16:53,"Oleg and Jason worked on a thesis showing the inherent vulnerabilities of a Turing-complete system several months ago now. It is a shame it was not released to the public as it may have persuaded some investors to perform due diligence as to what exactly they were investing in with Ethereum. Since the Emercoin Team publishes technical articles into Russian, there is no person translating these into English, so the DAO Hacker Scandal made many people lost their money, after this event people have remembered this article, but it was too late! For those of you who are looking to invest into a currency that has proven functionality that addresses real-World problems, here is your opportunity. Since 2013 Emercoin has been making real, tangible strides in the industry while the majority of investment capital has gone into outright scams or failed ventures. What this says about the collective mindset of current investors, I will leave up to you to decide. The cryptocurrencies Emercoin and Ethereum appeared almost simultaneously, but it is Ethereum that is on the public's lips. In the short term view, mining Ethereum is profitable, but the technology on which it is based is secondary and has little application for real world solutions. Emercoin not only has innovative ideas and great potential, but is already widely used in various fields of application. Oleg Khovayko, expert in the field of cryptography and computer security and one of the cofounders of Emercoin, explains more about the approach to blockchain development: ""Emercoin and Ethereum appeared around the same time. What is the difference in approach to the blockchain taken by Emercoin and Ethereum?"" To summarize Ethereum  maximum innovation, but a lot of critical pieces left untested. Emercoin takes a more conservative approach  maximum security. Our long term goal is a proven, tested operation without the shadow of failures or errors. With Ethereum, it is possible to incorporate many flexible/complex functions however with the Bitcoin and Emercoin blockchains, minimal functionality is incorporated to ensure the chains work for specific purposes. The blockchains of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Emercoin all have a similar structure. The differences arises when it is observed what is being added on top of, or to, the blockchain itself. For example, the blockchains of Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies are designed with one primary function in mind, the transfer of currency. With Ethereum, extra functions and services each of which may have their own purpose are integrated as a part of the blockchain itself. So what is the difference? Ethereum could be considered a Turing compatible system or ""Turing Complete""  The approach of Emercoin is different. From a development standpoint, we are not advocates of Turing compatible programs. When a system is considered Turing compatible, meaning it can be universally simulated/run, it brings with it common security flaws, errors and other negative factors detrimental to the program itself. As an example, Satoshi used very primitive script in the creation of Bitcoin. It is Turing incompatible: There are no branches or loops, the program is executed in a linear fashion. It is similar to the HTML language, which is also Turning-incompatible: A page or code is presented but it has no loops, so with HTML it is impossible to write a program that will run indefinitely. In Java or C++ it is possible to write loops in to the program, making Java and C++ Turing compatible languages. Ethereum script is similar to these languages in the sense that those who are familiar with them can create scripts for Ethereum. Why do we think our approach is better? It is imperative to clarify the objectives of our project. Security and safety of the network is the number one priority, not the ability to do everything all at once. When working with such cutting edge technology trust is the most important factor in driving adoption. Once trust is established, new innovation and design can be added on top of a secure platform. Adding too much without ensuring security is a reckless move and can lead to platform failure and lack of adoption. This approach of course does not lend to being in the spotlight with constant coverage on development. Instead, we continue to focus on practical applications for the blockchain with a wide horizon of development possibilities. Different approaches to the blockchain dictate different solutions. I believe Ethereum is a good platform for experimentation and verification of new ideas. The contracts can be used for testing, but to use them in critical systems is very risky. The applications are simply not mature enough at this time. What are the pros and cons of these approaches? One of the benefits of the approach taken by the Ethereum developers is great flexibility. There is very much conversation regarding the platform because there are so many opportunities for potential application. From the same attribute that could be considered positive, comes the negatives. There is not a proven level of security that is acceptable for critical applications, especially those that deal with large sums of money or human life. I dont believe there is any piece of perfect software. What we have however is security, stability, and the fact that the Emercoin platform simply works. Everything is based on the original code Satoshi has written and has repeatedly proven it can withstand a wide range of attacks. It has withstood the test of time during its brief existence and at the same time has improved and become more resilient against malicious actions. The Emercoin platform is built as an industrial and business level application and is compatible with many existing components and systems. There is also a laboratory option with Emercoin where it is possible to test with many different new ideas and experiments. Despite this, it seems many people have a different opinion. If Ethereum isn't safe, then why use it? My comments are not to indicate it is absolutely unsecure, just that it truly has not had the development or time to have passed the test. It has not yet earned its rite of passage and may be a long way away from doing so. Long term development of the code is important because it has proven that stress on the network is one of the best forms of security development and preventing crypto-attacks. Therefore, I suppose it would be possible to use in non-mission-critical applications. There are already people using the platform, but it is almost purely for experimentation. My past experience in the security department of the banking sector has left an indelible imprint on me and has a large impact on the technical solutions applied in Emercoin. This drives extra care in the development and incorporation of any external code. What do you think is the reason few people have heard about Emercoin, and so many of them talk about Ethereum? Theres very much excitement when a new project is in the early stages of development and promises great solutions. As an example, when speaking about our EMC DNS system, the proponents of Ethereum said that with their contracts 40 lines of code could create the same system. There are examples on technical forums where users of Ethereum claim that this could be done in two lines of code. These statements have been made but after nearly a year and a half of time to develop the solution using Ethereum, no progress has been made. In general, a significant problem is that technology has become too sophisticated for the average person, or even a small ambitious investor with some knowledge. This brings forth those involved in technology that can represent themselves well, but deliberately mislead those who do not understand their message. These people know that when they make the right presentation about themselves or their technology, it isnt necessary for them to make a serious technical analysis of what they are trying to promote. It is up and functioning  there are sales presentations and numerous prospects. Everyone is trying to sell the future by painting it in bright colors. It is mostly talk without true substance. We prefer to keep our approach simple and take the high road - we simply get things done. An industrial and engineering approach. We make real world solutions. How do you see the future situations of Ethereum and Emercoin? What do you expect to unfold? Most likely everything will disperse. After all, everyone has more or less located their own niche at this point. As Ive said: Ethereum is perfect for experimentation and testing new ideas. Emercoin is a system for industrial application. It will be used by those who appreciate long-term reliability and platforms that get the important jobs done. Not those who are looking for a multitude of extra and unnecessary features. There are some points of doubt I have on the feasibility of Ethereum. Their claims of nearing the performance and transaction processing of Visa when it comes to transaction per second is one I strongly object to. However my objections go beyond the scope of this article. There are many questions I have when it comes to the claims made by proponents of Ethereum, because I have a great understanding of the dangers and vulnerability of their approach. Why do you think banks are cooperating with Ethereum? I certainly dont know the criteria used when the banks are selecting a blockchain to work with. I would suppose that its because Ethereum is in the media spotlight, and useful for testing new ideas. After all, as far as one can assume, banks dont need a cryptocurrency for immediate use. It is a technological basis on which they can attempt to test what they want. So in essence, they are experimenting, collecting some data for themselves. We are taking our own path. Our DNS zones are already being implemented in real sites. EMCSS/EMCSSL systems are already used to control real computer farms. The EMCLNX advertising system already has real traffic and payments. Regarding advanced development - we are currently working with the Microsoft Azure platform. We are creating a series applications for the Azure market. The first application will be an online wallet without a miner, and with some other modifications. In addition to existing ideas and plans we are looking how we can push development even further, thus creating interaction between Microsoft and the OpenLedger exchange. After a bulk of this development has been completed, we will let the market appreciate and decide what is required. I believe all we have to offer will be found useful for users around the world.

157,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Coin-a-Year: Nyancoin,10,48fryt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/48fryt/coinayear_nyancoin/,2016-03-01 22:11:49,"Hello cryptocurrency lovers! Welcome to Coin-a-Year, the laziest series yet in the Coin-a-Day publishing empire. This year's coin is Nyancoin (NYAN). I originally covered Nyancoin in an article here in /r/cryptocurrency published January 4th, 2015. Without (much) further ado, I'm going to include the original report next, unmodified. This is unlike my Coin-a-Week series, where I use strikeout and update in-text. Because this is going to be a longer update, I'll just make all further comments and updates below, just realize that all information below is as of January 4th, 2015 and thus is more than a year out of date as of posting now, at the end of February 2016. Since I use horizontal rules as internal dividers in the original post, I'll use a double horizontal rule to divide the original text from this prelude and the following update. --- --- Coin-a-Day Jan 4th --- Welcome to the fourth installment of Coin-a-Day! To see convenient links to the introduction and the previous entries, please see /r/coinaday. Today's coin is **Nyancoin (NYAN)**. --- **Summary** ---  ~173.6 million available currently [1]; 337 million limit [2] ---  All-time high: ~0.000024 BTC on February 16, 2014 [1] ---  Current price: ~3 satoshi [1] ---  Current market cap: ~$1,275 [1] ---  Block rate (average): 1 minute [1] [3] ---  Transaction rate: ~25? / last 24 hours; estimated $3-4 [4] ---  Transaction limit: 70 / second [5] ---  Transaction cost: 0 for most transactions [6] ---  Rich list: ??? [7] ---  Exchanges: Cryptsy [8] ---  Processing method: Mining [10] ---  Distribution method: proof-of-work block rewards and 1% premine for ""bounties, giveaways &amp; dev support"" [2] [10] ---  Community: Comatose [9] ---  Code/development: URL ; there hasn't been a released code change in 10 months. The new developer has talked about some changes, but has not made a new release. He has given advice about how to keep the network running and operate the client. [10] ---  Innovation or special feature: First officially licensed cryptocurrency (from Nyancat) [2]; ""zombie""-coin [11] --- **Description / Community:** --- So you're probably wondering why in the world we're talking about a coin which has been declared dead and already written off. I actually first selected this coin to illustrate a ""deadcoin"", but the more I dug into it, the more I was amazed at the shambles I discovered. I am combining the description and community sections for this coin, because the community (or lack thereof) is the central issue for Nyancoin. Substantially all, if not literally all, of the original infrastructure is gone. From the announcement post, the original website has expired. The nyan.cat site itself survives, but has no reference to the coin. The github repo remains, but then there was never much changed from the bitcoin/litecoin original. In fact, the COPYING file doesn't even list ""Nyancoin Developers"". None of the original nodes seem to be running anymore. @Nyan_Coin hasn't tweeted since July 6th. And that was just to announce posting an [admittedly cute](URL picture to facebook which makes a claim for a future which seems never to have developed. Of the original 15 pools, I think all are dead except p2pool, for which [at least one node](URL still supports NYAN. The original blockchain explorer, nyancha.in, is still running. The faucet is dead or broken. The original exchanges no longer list it (two of the three having died; SwissCEX having ended its trading as of the first of this year). And so forth. And yet: &gt; [I'm not dead! I'm getting better!](URL &gt; --- &gt; No you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment. [Of course, that scene finishes with knocking out the ""recovering"" patient so he can be taken away...not to mention the absurdity of including Monty Python in a financial article, but moving right along.] There is still just enough left to Nyancoin to keep it twitching, even if it is on life-support. Whether it's an individual node or whether it's a pool, there are blocks being produced at a steady rate as intended. Transactions are being processed. There is still a market. There is still a block explorer. And there is a dev. It is like a case study in the absolute minimum necessary to keep a coin alive. The most likely outcome is almost certainly a final collapse when one critical piece or another of the infrastructure goes away. And yet in the meantime, a person can own a million NYAN for $8 [12], and then move this coin quickly and easy, albeit with no particular external demand. It's like the world's most hyped testnet. I think this case presents an interesting example of what happens to an altcoin when its initial support dries up. NYAN coin is more fortunate than some, actually, as there are some where there are no longer any nodes running it nor the original announcement thread (in fact, there was actually a second Nyancoin launched around the same time. But it died hard and its original announcement thread was deleted and at this point I would have no idea how to access it; so ""Nyancoin"" thus illustrates how hard a coin can die (Nyancoin 2) as well as how it can hang around despite being proclaimed dead, with far more justification behind that pronouncement than there has been for bitcoin (NYAN) ). --- **Footnotes** --- [1] URL --- [2] URL Regarding the premine, it's unclear to me where this money is now, since the original poster hasn't been active on BCT since May and the original site is down. However, given that it's only 1%, and about $25 in value right now, there seem to be more significant concerns for NYAN. --- [3] URL - Nyan blockchain explorer; blocks are somewhat inconsistent but somewhere around the 1 minute average --- [4] There doesn't seem to be anything automatically doing these stats, so I did visual inspection on about 1500 blocks (about one day) excluding the block generation reward (~250k/day). Most blocks are otherwise empty. I counted about 24 transactions or so scrolling through, with an outlier around 300k NYAN and another around 100k NYAN. In total, about 500k NYAN, excluding the block rewards. This is very approximately $3-4. --- [5] Nyancoin is a basically unmodified, slightly out-of-date bitcoin as far as code goes, and ignoring the change in block rate and total coin supply, as well as the difficulty retarget after every block. So for purposes of estimating maximum possible transaction throughput, I start with bitcoin's estimated 7 transactions per second, and multiply by 10 for having a block on average every minute rather than every 10 minutes. In any event, this limit is not likely to be reached in the foreseeable future. --- [6] Like bitcoin, transaction fees appear to be optional in Nyancoin. Unlike bitcoin, there is almost no transaction volume, and coins tend to sit for a relatively long time before being moved. So zero-fee transactions appear to be the norm from looking at a couple transactions on the block explorer. --- [7] I couldn't find one. See the disclosure section of this article: your humble correspondent is likely represented in some way on a top 100 if one were to be made or if one exists, despite not holding it directly, depending on how the exchange holds it. --- [8] I could not find any other exchanges still listing Nyancoin. SwissCex appears to have disabled it as of a couple days ago. Cryptsy has a notice that the NYAN/BTC market will be closing, but its NYAN/LTC market appears strong. --- [9] Essentially all of the original sites, pools, faucets, etc. are dead and there has been very little to replace it. There is basically a single node, or perhaps a very few, which are running the blockchain. However, there is a developer still trying to hold things together, /u/maxvall_dev, maxvall on BCT. He is the last hope for the NYAN. --- [10] URL This is the thread where maxvall took over as dev, and it also discusses switching to PoS, which hasn't happened as far as I know. --- [11] ""zombie""-coin: Not to be confused with ZMB (my god, does it ever end?). This is my term to describe a coin which is ""undead"": by rights it should be dead. And yet it's still walking around and acting like it's alive. What is it? What's going on? It's quite debatable whether this gives it any special value, but I find it an interesting state, and it's why this was chosen for early coverage. There are plenty of actually popular and successful coins, and we will go onto covering more normal selections; we're looking for variety rather than repetition. But I think this is an interesting example for what can go wrong, and yet in the midst of that, how little it takes for a coin to survive. In fact, it's almost like an alternate history bitcoin to me; this shows the concept that ""it was run on one computer before; it can be run on one computer again"" to some extent. And there are even some strange pragmatic benefits as well, like having no competition for getting a transaction into a block and thus zero transaction fees. [12] And, in fact, the author chose to do so today, spending about 0.03 BTC for about 1 million NYAN. --- **Additional Reading** ---  /r/nyancoins - Like NYAN: mostly dead, but not quite ---  URL - new official website ---  [BCT thread listing nodes](URL [xpool (p2pool)](URL for mining information. ---  [americanpegasus predicting in February that NYAN will hit $1](URL always an entertaining read --- **Giveaway** --- Instead of a challenge today, since NYAN has enough challenges, I decided I would give away 10,000 NYAN to at least the first ten people who ask for it. This still remains at my discretion, but honestly, if you really want, say, 50,000 NYAN and create four new accounts to do so, I'll probably be too amused to say no. I don't expect to get ten requests. If I get more, I'll probably still fulfill them, but as with everything else, this is left to my whim. --- **Donations and Disclosure** Okay, this is an important one today because of the tiny market here. I actually hold less USD value in NYAN than in BTC, DOGE, and PPC (although my value in PPC might be about equivalent actually), but I hold more of the total market in NYAN than any of those three. And I'll probably be buying more. So **I have a conflict of interest in writing this article**. I *am not* providing financial advice and I do not make any recommendations of any sort on any matters. Make your own decisions; do your own research. Please, I do not want to hear about anyone doing anything ""on my advice."" I **am not offering advice**. I personally hold just over 1 million NYAN on Cryptsy right now. Perhaps it would be better if I didn't write any articles about anything I were ~~invested in~~speculating on, but I started this series for my own education to further my speculation, so unfortunately, dear reader, your needs come second to my own. tanstaafl; you get what you pay for, and I'm giving you my thoughts. If by some strange quirk of fate you actually own NYAN and enjoyed this article and wished to donate some to me, K7Ho9HghBF6xWwS6JsepE6RAEPyAXbsQCV is mine (first non-empty account I've posted; transferred 1000 NYAN into here earlier from Cryptsy to test that the network and my wallet were actually working). Thank you all for reading and commenting! I've already learned a lot from this process and I look forward to more! --- **Upcoming coins:** ---  January 5th: Nxt ---  January 6th: Darkcoin ---  January 7th: Namecoin --- --- I'll use alphabetic labeling for footnotes in the updates to avoid any confusion with the footnotes in the original. For simplicity, unchanged items, like the 337 million limit and the 1 minute will not be mentioned, and we'll start with the summary changes. **Updates:** --- **Summary** --- * ~263.7 million NYAN currently exist [a] --- * Current price: ~7 satoshi [b] --- * Current market cap: ~$8,000 [c] --- * Transaction rate: ~185 / last 24 hours; ~3,300,000 NYAN (~$100) [d] --- * Exchanges: Cryptopia [e] --- * Community: We're not quite dead yet; in fact, I think we're getting better! [f] --- * Code/Development: I have [an early draft of NYAN2](URL but I'm about six months past my initial goal for having it available to use. Life/work/lack of build machine/procrastination. NYAN2 will be a rebase onto a modern LTC codebase which will soft fork to fix a current vulnerability to a fork bug. For now, the network still runs on the same code that it did when I wrote the first article. --- **Discussion** I'm going to consider the community first, since I pointed it out as the weakness and central topic in the last one, then talk about the technical situation briefly, and then review the financial results. The community has been excellent, if I do say so myself. We've got working infrastructure going thanks to the contributions of many Nekonauts (see [f]). Some original Nekonauts have returned or at least popped in from time to time, and new ones like myself have found Nyancoin (I would say given what I wrote in the original, I was still a skeptic of it at that point. Not that skeptics can't be Nekonauts, but I think I'd put my conversion to the cult of nyan shortly after writing that, even though I was already a nillionaire then for the heck of it.) While I do look forward to seeing the community continue to grow in future years and consider that important, I don't think the community is our weakest point any longer; I think it's now our strongest point. I've tried to encourage the community's revival as best I could, including giving away tens of nillions in total, and lots of long rambling articles on my views on ethics and philosophy and frankly it's worked better than I would've really expected (or at least it has coincided with an effective recovery of the community). The community also helped me through at least a couple hard times personally in there as well. --- The technical situation in Nyancoin is mostly unchanged but slightly improved, although with two additional known vulnerabilities. It's unchanged in that it's the same client. It's improved in that we have an active nyanchain explorer host (nyan.space), and we have a public draft of a plan for a soft forking security fix update in the near future (hopefully by the end of March (although I've slipped these deadlines before and may well miss March for release by a bit, I do think I'm inching closer now and then)). The most serious vulnerability is to forking. This is the bug which hit Peercoin if I recall correctly. NYAN2 is intended to solve this through its soft fork from the LTC fix upstream (from the BTC fix upstream). In the meantime, we've been lucky we haven't been attacked. The tiny marketcap probably helps with not being a particularly attractive attack target. We're not exactly about to pay ransom to move faucet outputs. But that's no excuse; we want this fixed and should have it finally done ""soon"" (tm). The less serious vulnerability is to a time warp attack in the difficulty function (Kimoto Gravity Well), which relates to general weaknesses it has and issues we've had with large gaps in the block chain because of spikes in the difficulty function causing it to be unprofitable and driving away most of the hash, and then low difficulty and price rise making it attractive to more hash, creating a spike and causing it again. While this is irritating, the chain still works, even if there are fits and starts at times. An important part of the reason I can get away with this is because there is at least one Nekonaut-supporting miner, /u/CartmanSPC, who rescues us from time to time, and [did so during the course of this article being written](URL We have a bunch of pools, but sometimes the hash just isn't there to get us unstuck when the difficulty goes high enough. Another part of the reason I consider it not an especially serious issue is because there's a workaround which works for me (classic bad developer logic): I use a large transaction fee (generally 337 NYAN, although I might have halved it after the most recent halving, I'll probably use 337 again) on my personal wallet by default. If necessary, I use a couple of them. It can make NYAN profitable to mine again despite the higher difficulty and ""unstick"" the chain. The difficulty function can go back down again in the next block if the gap has been long enough, so that can be enough to keep it going again for a while (although it can also get stuck again irritatingly fast at times). A fix for this will be putting in a better difficulty function for NYAN3, which will require a hard fork. This is tentatively scheduled for feature freeze around the middle of this year, coding to follow, activation sometime early 2017. --- Financial has been our most disappointing performance. A graph of the 1 year performance right now on coinmarketcap looks pretty sad, showing our fall from a little over 60 satoshi down to around 7 satoshi now. We rose too high, too fast, and I didn't stick with the safe high paying job like a sane person. Instead I hit the road, went to jail, and worked minimum wage. That doesn't sound like a sentence from a cryptocurrency financial review, does it? But the performance of NYAN since the article has been the story of my personal finances, which is the story of my life since then. So, autobiographical coinaday interlude, trying to keep it generally to the most salient points. Well, in 2014 I had been on my way home to Minnesota from California when I was pulled over leaving Eureka, Nevada for speeding (got sloppy and went 45 approaching the 45 sign and thus technically still in the 35; bored cop seeing out-of-state plates). My vehicle reeked of weed, what with having been in Mendocino County previously with no intention of traveling out of the county much less state anytime soon but family emergency brought me back, and the end result was a citation for possession of cannabis and paraphernalia along with the speeding. Fast forward to the beginning of 2015, I'm settled into a good software position and start looking more at cryptocurrency in my spare time. I write the coin-a-day series for a bit and then got annoyed and quit after a while when trying to do one a day on top of an actual job was too much for me (along with some annoyance over criticism; I can be rather thin-skinned at times). But I had gotten interested in Nyancoin, and started buying it up more and more with extra money I was making. And then comes the crash. I had to stop putting as much in as I realized that where I was living and what I was working on wasn't going to work out for me and I needed to figure something else out. So, as I seem wont to do, I went on a roadtrip. I quit my job. And I went back for the court date for my citations and refused to pay, instead spending 10 days in jail rather than pay ~$1400 (I actually had the money in cash available to me if I chose to pay as a backup if I chickened out, but the judge annoyed me enough that I really preferred to be jailed instead of paying, as stupid as that sounds since I'm quite sure the judge didn't care in the least one way or another). After that, I went back to roadtrip lifestyle for a while. It was a nice period. A lot of beautiful scenery; a lot of reading. Eventually, I busted up my car pretty badly...a couple times actually, the second time for good. Fast forwarding through the rest of the year, I worked a couple minimum wage jobs to pay bills and avoid cubicle life and kill some time until I figured out what I was going to do next. Just recently I quit as delivery boy after getting a speeding ticket (I swear, I'm not as horrible of a driver as this makes me sounds, although I have had a bad tendency to speed in the past, which I really have curbed to almost nothing; but I'm clearly not good enough) and am currently writing a Coin-a-Year article with a friend's incentive and applying to do documentation and development with the Nu project. Okay, so what did any of that have to do with NYAN? Well, it's the mess of a life that has led to the fall of the price from 60 satoshi to 7 satoshi. If instead my life history for the time since the article had been simply ""I was happily employed writing software"", then I don't believe we would have dropped below 20 satoshi. It's easy to see in hindsight. If anyone can lend me a time machine, I'm sure I can get some condensed instructions which should improve performance significantly. Otherwise, just going to have more chalked up for the ""character building"" tally. So, lessons learned if you are the major buy support for your coin: you need long-term reserves. Whatever you put in bids can be taken out in a moment by a dump for no apparent reason. This is particularly true if you may be quitting your cushy, high-paying job and wandering around without income for an extended period of time. Rather obvious, but hey, maybe someone else can learn from my mistakes. If I'd been bidding as cautiously as I am now from the beginning, I think the price would probably be somewhere from 10-20 satoshi now instead of around 7 satoshi. It's especially unfortunate given that I wanted to be able to demonstrate the more consistent growth possible building a stable store of value, as opposed to the pump and dumps common in altcoins. And instead we had a pump-and-dump looking graph ourselves after I bid up higher than I was able to sustain, and a large (10+ nillion) instadump crashed the market all the way back down to 1 satoshi momentarily. We've had a few large (2+ nillion) dumps since, but nothing that large. We haven't generally had that large of bids though either. It's hard to know when I've exhausted the supply at a price level, when it sometimes waits for a couple weeks or even more and then fills all the bids at once. But I want to maximize the minimum price paid because I think that's important for building confidence in a store of value long-term, which is one of my core goals for NYAN. At the same time, we're still up from the lowest parts of the floor and where I found it. Since I own about 30% [g], the very cheapest supply has been taken off the market. I plan to keep on buying up ""cheap NYAN"" as much as I can. I've bought up to 60 satoshi before, I'll probably buy up that high this time around. I've got a token 100,000 NYAN ask at 300 satoshi; I hope never to sell lower. --- **Conclusions** Now I try to wrap it all together as if I saw this all coming and am the wise expert, despite having had about 90% drop in price in the last year after bidding too high. My original concept was taking the ""minimum viable coin"" and reviving it to a powerhouse as a textbook example in how to do it. Part of my core concept in this is the arbitrariness of value: throughout history, humans have chosen any number of things as a store of value for the time: salt, large rocks, certain metals, disks, [marked sticks](URL and so forth. While there has generally been a certain logic in the choice, in that there is a locally restricted supply in one way or another, and so forth, from the perspective of other centuries or cultures the choices can seem quite strange. Growing up, I was always struck by how strange the notion of salt being limited and valuable seemed in a world where people were trying to reduce intake and large amounts could be bought for trivial sums. And yet, a key nutrient necessary for life fundamentally makes more sense as being valuable than notched sticks or printed paper or a piece of plastic with some encoded information. Humans have perpetually come up with stranger and stranger ways of storing and transferring value. Each new step, as always, comes with its own disadvantages and, frankly, has generally appeared nonsensical at best and fraudulent at worst to the status quo. Which doesn't mean that each new attempt is valuable. The gold bugs always like to point out that every fiat currency ultimately returns to its true value of zero. And the skeptics of cryptocurrency argue that all cryptocurrencies will eventually return to their true value of zero. It's certainly possible. And it's possible the USD will hyperinflate someday. I tend to try the moderate view for a plausible guess of the future. By that type of logic, I would guess that over the course of decades, USD will in general lose value, and cryptocurrency will tend to slowly gain value. That might not seem the moderate view, but USD *not* losing value over decades would be truly shocking. And hyperinflation has been predicted since the USD went off the gold standard, or before. So some amount of inflation less than hyperinflation seems like the safe guess (but then, the Titanic arriving would also have seemed like the safe guess to me). And with cryptocurrency, I think it's clear by now the technology will continue to survive. So my first question is with what overall value as a market? It could go down, of course, but that seems unlikely in an already small, young market. Even if all the current crop die off and are replaced, whatever cryptocurrencies are around should be able to do better than a handful of billion in market cap in my view. I believe that cryptocurrency has a bright future ahead of it. The best coins should ultimately survive and thrive. But I've been wrong on most of my major calls so far, like for instance when I thought BTC was over-priced around $5-$10. I think Nyancoin can have an important role to play in the future of cryptocurrency in the years and decades to come, but it's a massively speculative long-shot. See also [Nyancoin risks document](URL But like [Linus Torvalds' autobiography](URL I try to keep ""Just for Fun"" as a core motto and principle. It's makes for a good hobby project because there will always be more to work on, with a core community motto of **TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!** --- **Disclaimers / Sponsorship:** As I said before: &gt; I *am not* providing financial advice and I do not make any recommendations of any sort on any matters. Make your own decisions; do your own research. Please, I do not want to hear about anyone doing anything ""on my advice."" I **am not offering advice**. And I'll reiterate that I own about 30% [g] of the current supply of NYAN, which makes me by definition maximally biased. Also, I'm not sure what's up with the address from the first post. It doesn't show up in my current wallet as a recognized address. So, anyhow, don't send there. :-) If you'd like to donate, please consider [sponsoring a coin-a-day or coin-a-week article](URL This is the first sponsored article. This Coin-a-Year article has been brought to you by /u/spydud22 's generous patronage. I'd been meaning to do a Coin-a-Week article on Nyancoin for a while, but between wanting to ""wait until the price recovered a bit"" and general procrastination, then it seemed like it would make a good Coin-a-Year article, and then I wanted to wait until the price recovered a bit more...anyhow, so thank you /u/spydud22, for causing me to finally do this. :-) --- **Footnotes** --- * [a] nyan.space/chain/Nyancoin ; as of block 1091430, 263738786.71890615 NYAN outstanding. This is slightly over 50% more than the last report, which is what we would expect, since it had existed for about a year then, and has approximately annual halvings. The first year generated about 50% of total supply; the second year generated about 25% of total supply. We should expect in a year to have about 17% (one-sixth) more than we have now. --- * [b] URL ; this is the only market reflected in coinmarketcap and it is the primary one on which I trade. Cryptopia also has other base pairs which operate at significantly higher spreads (lower bids; higher asks) and have minimal volume. In the time since the last report, NYAN has traded as high as 60 satoshi (and briefly a little higher at times), but over the last almost twelve months since a peak about a year ago, the price has been generally declining overall, as a gross oversimplification of a lot of movements. This has been an effect of me not being able to keep buying as much and there being large dumps I wasn't expecting from time-to-time. Now I'm taking the approach of building large (one or more nillion (million NYAN)) bids on each price as I slowly work my way back up again in order to be able to handle possible dumps with less price shock. --- * [c] coinmarketcap.com/currencies/nyancoin/ ; as noted in [b], this only reflects the /BTC basepair on Cryptopia but that's where most of the volume is anyhow. Of course, the market is also not particularly liquid since I'm the primary buyer and have rather limited means currently. --- * [d] I haven't setup a script to count this yet, among many things on my to-do list for someday, so I went through by hand from what was the then-latest block of 1091430 on nyan.space back to 1089766 which was the first block generated less than 24 hours before. There was actually a three and a half hour block gap at that point, such that the next prior block was about 24 hours and 15 minutes before 1091430 while 1089766 was only about 20 hours and 45 minutes prior, and has a disproportionate number of transactions and value compared to a typical block (8 and ~313,000 NYAN respectively) from the build-up during the gap. But since that gap conveniently started right about at the start of the 24 hour period, doesn't really skew our results here. Note that there are often times where the UTXO created during one transaction during the day is spent during a later transaction in the day. This can be considered the ""same"" Nyancoin being ""spent"" twice in the same day in our total. But in practice, I believe what's happening here is the faucet is breaking off small (10-50 NYAN) pieces from a larger (~40,000 NYAN) chunk, and so that pops up a bunch of times. So the total NYAN blockchain volume as counted for this topline number should not be interpreted as ""NYAN spent in the day"" but ""NYAN moved on the chain"", where the ""same coin"" can move many times. So it's a very easily gamed metric and not a strong / resistant metric like the market price tends to be (at least relatively speaking), but it's a fun number to calculate and provides a little bit of information. The transaction count can also be easily inflated and certainly, for instance, having the faucet does generate transactions which are a very common transaction. And this is also just an arbitrary 24 hour period compared to a previous arbitrary 24 hour period. Nonetheless, I do think there's clearly a bit more activity on the Nyanchain, even though the typical block is still empty and the number of transactions and volume is still tiny compared to the major cryptocurrencies. [Here's an arbitrary example of the faucet transactions](URL Note the zero transaction fee, which I love that the miners support (the defaults are all quite low as well). [Here's an example of what may be the smallest transaction by NYAN volume of the day](URL but no, I followed its small, spent output, and it led to [this gem](URL which also links to [this](URL I have no idea what's going on here, but it's hilarious and I love it. How's that for microtransaction support? :-) --- * [e] Obviously Cryptsy went down. We had had more than enough red flags with Cryptsy (including one time where I was able to withdraw 6 nillion more than I had in my balance) and got onto Cryptopia. /u/spydud22 basically accomplished that for us, although I helped out in the tail end of the campaigning. --- * [f] Our community is still small (I wish there were literally dozens of us!) but we've had valuable activity from multiple people, including, just as highlights, /u/vmp32k who hosts nyan.space, a clone of the original nyancha.in, /u/jwflame who created the excellent nyancoin.info intro site, with the [awesome status page](URL (which currently notes that ""the last 500 blocks actually took 111 minutes, which is approaching the speed of light, causing the universe to become unstable""), /u/KojoSlayer who runs the faucet and dice, /u/spydud22 who got us on Cryptopia, and many other Nekonauts have made worthy contributions, and the Nekonauts mentioned have done more than just that listed. So while we are small, we are active at least from time to time and technically capable. Even though our posting rate is still around 1 post a day or so on average, and so still a relatively quiet subreddit (and it is our main (only?) hub), it's still a very noticeable and significant difference from how /r/nyancoins looked when I was reviewing it for the original piece here. [Here's an attempt to approximate what was there using Reddit search](URL ; archive.org has a [snapshot on January 19th, 2015](URL which is well into the early revival mania and [one from August 14th, 2014](URL before four and a half months of little to no activity. Apparently archive.org unsubscribed to /r/nyancoins in that interval itself... --- * [g] Maybe up to around 35% by now; maybe still around 30%. I haven't updated hodling report lately; it was 30% last time I recall, but I've bought more and more has been made since. ---"
158,vulnerability,CryptoCurrency,Coin-a-'Week': Peercoin (PPC),16,3823rn,http://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/3823rn/coinaweek_peercoin_ppc/,2015-06-01 18:20:58,"**Coin-a-Day Jan 3rd** --- Well, it's been more than a month since my last post, so I figured it's time to finally do this. I'm barely updating these, but I think it's somewhat interesting to see the changes that have happened over the almost half a year since I first wrote these. --- Welcome to the third ~~[Coin-a-Day](URL post! So far in this series we have talked about ~~[bitcoin](URL and ~~[dogecoin](URL which are proof-of-work coins. Today's coin is **Peercoin (PPC)**, which is a ""proof-of-stake"" coin (actually a hybrid; more below). --- **Summary** ---  ~22 million available currently [1]; ~35 million in 2025, ~50 million in 2045, 1% annual inflation permanently [2] ---  All-time high: ~$7 [3] ---  Current price: ~~~$0.50; ~0.0017 BTC~~$0.30; 0.00128 BTC [1] ---  Current market cap: ~~~$10.9 million~~ $6.6 million [1] ---  Block rate (average): 10 minutes [4] ---  Transaction rate: ~~520~~ 408 transactions in the last 24 hours, estimated ~~~$213,000~~ $83,600 [5] ---  Transaction limit (currently): 7 transactions / second (?) [6] ---  Transaction cost: Fixed at 0.01 PPC **edit: per Kb** [2] ---  Rich list: Top 100 addresses hold ~~59.25%~~ 59.52% [5] ---  Exchanges: BTC-E mostly; BTC38 (Chinese); some volume on Cryptsy, The Rock Trading, and BTER as well [7] ---  Processing method: Hybrid; proof-of-work and proof-of-stake ---  Distribution method: proof-of-work block rewards and 1% inflation through proof-of-stake ---  Community: Moderately active. [8] ---  Code / development: URL ; appears ~~in~~active~~, last release in April, last commit five months ago; however,~~ developer Sunny King continues to give weekly updates and has announced an upcoming ""cold-minting"" feature [14] **EDIT:** Active pull request in progress. [pull request](URL [announcement](URL I was informed about this from the comment below; thanks /u/Thireus ! Latest 0.5 version will be a mandatory upgrade with a two month release window. [15] ---  Innovation or special value: First coin with proof-of-stake --- **Description:** --- So far we have covered two proof-of-work coins. This was the original type of coin. Peercoin introduced the concept of ""proof-of-stake"", where authority to generate a block was determined based on a brute-force hashing to reach a value less than a certain amount. In Peercoin's proof-of-staking, there is only one to check per unspent wallet-output per second, so there is very little demand for processing power and energy. The difficulty is decreased with increased coindays [9]. This model is argued by Peercoin supporters to be more efficient, since it obviates the need for a hardware arms-race and allows transaction processing by all stakeholders. The incentive for the stakeholders to ""stake"" (process transactions through proof-of-stake) is two-fold: first, in order to collect their 1% per coin-year reward, and second, to support the network they hold coins in, since the value of the coin is presumed to be related to the stability and reliability of its network. ~~There are a number of attacks which are argued to be possible in proof-of-stake which are not possible in proof-of-work [10]. There was a vulnerability which allowed generating a larger number of proof-of-stake blocks with a very small stake which took four months to close after public disclosure [11]. I wish I could provide a definitive answer about the security or vulnerability of this coin, but I am simply unaware of a good source at this point [12]. I have not found a ""smoking gun"" critique of the current system, but absence of proof, particularly when my ""research"" (googling) is so limited, and my exposure is so brief, is absolutely not to be taken for proof of absence. Today's challenge will focus on the security of Peercoin, and there will be a small reward for the best defense and the best critique.~~ ~~Compared to the question of ""is it secure?"", I think the rest of the nuances like price history are relatively insignificant. In general, I expect that secure coins will continue to be transacted at some price level, and that they will often share a certain level of correlated price. Remember that I am not giving advice, but that's my take on it. So if there is no vulnerability to proof-of-stake, I expect it will continue to exist. And just as bitcoin has a strong place from being the first and having an active community, I expect that Peercoin would continue to have a place as the first proof-of-stake along with its smaller but also active community.~~ I had my concerns about the security resolved [when this was posted](URL Like a whiny chump I'd gone through and deleted all of my stuff in a fit of pique, but the useful comments by /u/TotalB00n are still there and may be useful reading. The inactive development may not be an issue for now if there are no serious threats to Peercoin. Additionally, its blockchain is quite small, about 1/3rd of a Gigabyte currently[13], so the major feature of bitcoin's latest release, parallel block downloads, may be less relevant for peercoin. [Note that the edit above on the code section is from the original time around. I'm too lazy to even look up whether or not there has been further development since, but it was at least somewhat active before, and perhaps didn't really need much.] **Community** Peercoin's community on Reddit (/r/peercoin) is relatively small, with less than 4k subscribers and no more than a couple posts a day. However, it appears on-topic and high-quality. URL looks active and significant. It is not comparable in size to a central hub like bitcointalk, but it is by no means dead. There are additional community links on peercoin.net which I haven't explored. --- **Footnotes** --- [1] URL --- [2] URL --- [3] URL I couldn't find anything just stating the number. And the UI here is terrible. But this approximately matches the coinmarketcap ATH in BTC with the BTC/USD at the time. --- [4] URL ; I wasn't sure if this accounted for PoS accurately as well, but given the last few hours shown at URL it does appear to be close ; don't ask me how it works, haven't taken the time to grok the whitepaper in detail yet ([9]) --- [5] URL --- [6] I wasn't able to find a source addressing this. I'm presuming that since it's based on bitcoin and has 10 minute blocks, that it also shares the 1 Mb blocksize limit and that transactions are about the same size and thus the same 7 transactions / second current limit applies. I could absolutely be wrong about this; if you know better, please let me know and I will update. Given that this allows 604,800 transactions per day, and there weren't 0.1% as many transactions in the last 24 hours, I think it's safe to say this isn't a limiting factor for peercoin in the foreseeable future. --- [7] URL --- [8] Not as active as doge or bitcoin, but it looks like there's activity on URL and /r/peercoin is quiet but not dead. --- [9] URL ; also available in many other languages (URL --- [10] URL /u/110101002 makes allegations along these lines. However, none of the critiques seem to be relevant and aware of the current Peercoin code. The claim is made that it was made centralized but I'm not aware of a Peercoin source that seems to make this claim. There are probably far better critiques and defenses of the security of Peercoin's proof-of-stake out there. I don't know how to best find them. This will be the topic for the challenges for this article. [11] [disclosure](URL [acknowledgement](URL [fix](URL [12] I have heard claims about ""nothing-at-stake"" attacks, which are based on the idea that a user might have stake in the system, then get the stake back, sell it, and then try to make their own chain building off the point where they had stake. This seems conceivable to me, but I do not know anywhere near enough to be able to make a reasonable argument one way or another. Unfortunately, most of the [discussions](URL on Proof-of-Stake seem more about ... well, there's no way to phrase it politely, but they don't seem to be reasoned consideration of the merits but just static. URL - This is an example of a critique which is shot down. Is it valid? You decide. From reading their view of it, it sounds like not. --- [13] URL --- [14] I found this relatively late in my process glancing over /r/peercoin. URL The details of this feature will be considered out-of-scope for this article, already taking longer than I anticipated (as usual). --- [15] URL --- **Additional Reading** ---  URL - main site; informative and useful links ---  /r/peercoin - somewhat quiet but still active and informative ---  URL - Peercoin discussion thread ---  [Peercoin whitepaper](URL - ([other languages available](URL ---  peercointalk.org - Main discussion forum --- **Daily challenge** ~~Every day I post a challenge worth about $1. The first two day's are still unattempted. Yesterday's has been awarded. Today's challenge focuses on Peercoin security. A changetip $0.50 tip will be awarded to the comment which in my opinion provides the best information about vulnerabilities in Peercoin's current consensus algorithm / implementation. This may be a link to a source that provides this information or a comment, but a comment referencing fixed problems or simply asserting issues without support will not be accepted as qualifying. On the other side will be a 1 PPC reward sent to the Peercoin address of your choice for the best argument supported with evidence that Peercoin's consensus algorithm is not vulnerable to any attack. This is a very broad claim, and I wouldn't know how to support it myself, but that's why I'm throwing it out there for discussion. Making an argument for both sides is allowed and encouraged.~~ [I don't remember if I ever paid up on this. I think I might owe /u/TotalB00n a couple PPC...] --- **Donations and Disclosure** It has come time again for me to note that I am not an authority nor should my words be used for anything other than entertainment. I am not providing investment advice and you should do your own research independently before you make any investment decisions. Cryptocurrencies may lose all value from technical flaws or simply a loss of faith in their value. Store your treasures in heaven, not on earth nor even in a blockchain. Be gentle and loving in deed and in thought. I currently hold about 17 PPC. ~~If you would like to donate PPC to me directly, you may do so at: PDcpAFGWEAJDTey6ghY4FRvvphXv9zkjmn~~ Thank you all for reading and all of your support! This has already been a great experience for me and I'm looking forward to the excitement still to come. --- Well, it doesn't get much lazier than that. Apparently PPC has dropped in price rather significantly since January. I don't know any of the news on it. Informative, eh? ...okay, I'll do a mild amount of ""research"". One moment. Well, they have a new release coming out. [15] But I don't see anything obvious from a quick glance at top stories in that subreddit over the past year to see why it crashed over the last five months. So...hey, let's go really lazy. Rather than me giving you the answers, why don't you tell me wtf happened here? xD --- Up next: **Nyancoin**!"

My initial thought was something like, ""studying/researching the effect of an anonymous, digital cash that is not bound to a central banking authority and carries on transaction cost across borders. As well as look at their origins, implications of a truly international cost-free of value, vulnerability to cyber theft, freedom from Keynesian central banking system, etc."" Does that seem like a viable approach to this idea?

161,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Introducing Energy Web Chain. The biggest blockchain platform you've never heard of!,1,gdtbfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/gdtbfx/introducing_energy_web_chain_the_biggest/,2020-05-05 17:37:07,"**Energy Web Token** **This isnt a short read so let me start with the tl;dr; there is an in-depth post after this part** There are so many shill posts on Reddit for when a $1bn company adopts a certain blockchain project or uses an ecosystem, well Im bringing you 2000x that and youve probably never even heard of it. The companies that form the EW ecosystem collectively turnover in excess of $2tn per year. The companies that host nodes on EW chain turnover approx. $650bn each year. - The largest energy companies in the world have all got together and said we need to build something to harness the power of DLT, together with the Energy Web Foundation they made this happen. Simply put, the Energy Web Chain is a platform and ecosystem for the energy markets. - FULLY approved by the SEC - hence no ICO or IEO - must comply with stringent energy providers and energy market regulations. - Validators that invested and now host nodes for the chain include the largest energy companies in the world, including Shell, EDF, Engie, PTT, Total, TEPCO. Energy Web Validators expect to have a third of all Wind, Solar and biomass producing devices on-chain by 2030, over 250m assets (solar panels, wind generators etc.) in a sector that is predicted to be worth $13tn by 2050. - There are over 100 companies currently developing and using the Energy Web Ecosystem - Total revenue of the largest 22 companies in the ecosystem = $1.5tn per year. Total is in excess of $2tn. - The validators have established a goal for the amount of energy they want to SAVE in 10 years by using EW Chain - this equals more than the entire installed electricity generating capacity of the United States. - I want to emphasize that these arent hype inducing promises or pie in the sky ambitions, the companies that want to achieve these things on chain are already the biggest in the world and already have a vested interest in the platform THEY BUILT. *The hype factor: * Less than 200 investor wallets Unofficial TG group was only founded a few days ago THERE WAS NO ICO OR IEO, youre not going to get Shell market dumping on you and this is why it was so under the radar. - Companies totaling over $2tn in collective revenue are actively building the ecosystem and have skin in the game. If another project landed just one of these clients or had one of these companies building on their ecosystem they would be $100m market cap. With this in mind, Energy Web Token should be easily top 10 and in the billions of market cap. New exchanges - tier one, tier two and a DEX coming, with one coming within the next month. Should have no problem being listed on tier ones due to SEC tick of approval. You can fact check everything I say here - the project is open source. *Right lets get stuck into it*  **What is the Energy Web Foundation?** URL Firstly, lets start with who actually orchestrated the creation of the EW Chain and Ecosystem, the Energy Web Foundation in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Institute. The Energy Web Foundation is a global not-for-profit organization that creates open sourced, decentralized software around their blockchain ecosystem, the Energy Web Chain. In just a couple of years, The Energy Web Foundation has managed to grow the largest energy blockchain ecosystem comprising utilities, grid operators, renewable energy developers, corporate energy buyers and others. More on this later. **What is the Energy Web Chain?** The Energy Web Chain is a public, enterprise-grade blockchain platform designed for the energy sectors regulatory, operational and market needs. The energy market is extremely regulated and as such the PoS mechanism that Eth is deploying was not deemed adequate for the energy market by the regulators. Therefore, the energy web chain works on an amended version of Ethereum (it is not ERC-20!) which leverages Proof of Authority - only global energy companies can host nodes to validate the chain - more on validators later. Launched in mid-2019, it has become the industrys leading choice as the foundational digital infrastructure on which to build and run blockchain-based decentralized applications (dApps). Anybody can create a dApp on EW Chain, and the team are currently tracking 17 dApps that are scheduled to migrate across to main-net. Currently The Energy Origin dApp built by Engie is live - more on this later! You can check out their explorer here: Main-net: URL Test-net: URL URL **Most current AMA** URL **Validators Overview** Full list of validators here: validators.energyweb.org Some of the validators for the chain for those that dont like links: Shell EDF Engie Total PTTFluviusElia GroupStedin Centrica These companies host nodes to support the network. **Ecosystem overview** Shell - $388B PTT - $53B Tepco - $63B Total - $209B Exelon - $36B State Grid Ev service (subsidiary of State Grid Corp of China) - $363B Acciona - $8B Chubu - $22B Stedin - $1.2B EnBW - $25B EDF - $75B Engie - $65B Eneco - $4.5B Siemens - $94B SP Group - $4.1B Tenaska - $11.9B Wipro - $7.7B PG&amp;G - $17.7B Centrica - $37.1B AGL - $8.1B APG - $1.2B AES - $10.7B + 100 more. Sum = $1.5tn of revenue between the 22 largest companies that make up the ecosystem. **Goal of the Energy Web ecosystem and maths behind their growth predictions:** Our goal is to reduce 10 gigatons of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector over the next decade by onboarding over 225 million low-carbon energy assets into applications supported by EW-DOS. This will result in 870 GW of additional renewable generation capacity and 515 GW of low-carbon demand-side flexibility. Together, these equal more than the entire installed electricity generating capacity of the United States. URL we project one-third of total wind, solar, and biomass resources (in terms of installed capacity) to issue EACs via platforms built on Origin by 2030, increasing from 0% today. As shown below, achieving our goals (at least 870 GW of additional renewable generation and 515 GW of DER / DR capacity) will require onboarding roughly 225 million assets into EW-DOS. This equals a lot of on-chain activity. **So that briefly covers the chain and ecosystem, which anybody can create dApps on, but where is EWFs value add?** The Energy Web Foundation has created two toolkits to help companies build on the Energy Web chain, these are detailed below: *Energy Web Origin- (NOT THE SAME AS THE ENERGY ORIGIN - THE DAPP BY ENGIE)* The EW Origin suite of SDKs supports existing and emerging renewable energy and carbon markets to simplify and enhance the issuance, tracking and buying/selling of energy attribute certificates (EACs), including renewable energy certificates (RECs), guarantees of origin (GOs) and international I-RECs. *Energy Web Flex-* The EW Flex suite of SDKs enable grid operators including vertically integrated utilities, distribution system operators (DSOs) and transmission system operators (TSOs) to integrate distributed energy resources (DERs) into energy markets and demand flexibility programs. **Energy Web Token** The platform is powered by the Energy Web Token (EWT) which is an evolution of Ethereum. The EWF recognized that Ethereum wasnt suitable for the energy sector, which requires higher TPS for devices and higher security, in line with regulation. *So what is the use of the token?* First off, in a recent AMA, Jesse (CTO) said this; Q- Can you confirm all Validators do in fact have to buy and sell tokens from exchanges or is there another process open to get EWT, like OTC? A- The only place where tokens can be bought or sold are the exchanges where EWT is listed. This is why the Energy Web team is working on getting EWT listed on additional exchanges so more people have access to EWT (more announcements on additional exchanges coming soon). The team have also said; It is likely that validators that are running use cases will not be able to generate all tokens needed by themself, so theyll need to buy. So companies that need tokens, must buy (in the future via a treasury service) from exchanges. *Intrinsic uses;* Validator compensation - to pay for transaction fees and block rewards Chain security - to protect the network against transaction execution misbehaviour *Extrinsic uses;* Collateral - to enhance trust at the app level, e.g. in representations Community fund - 38m tokens put aside for further software development, bounties etc. Volume based approach to value- Small fees, large numbers of transactions. Currently 3m monthly transactions on test-net with this anticipated to grow exponentially as more value is pushed through the system and 250m devices are added. EWT is currently listed on Liquid and from the 7th May will be listed on BitMart. **Supply &amp; Market Cap** Total supply: 100m Circulating supply: 46m 25m of that currently sits within the ecosystem with the energy companies. 21m is outside from the affiliate sales. Current market cap is therefore $92m *Let me guess, its put you off somewhat?* Some of the validators for the chain: Shell TEPCO EDF Engie Total PTT Centrica Companies on ecosystem have a combined revenue of approx. $2tn a year and they have COMMITTED to using the ecosystem. The chain is 9 months old, has averaged 3m transactions per month on testnet and 17 apps are in production for mainnet, with one already live. Companies above are set to capture a third of the total market for renewables, with the devices pledged to run on-chain. Compare this to any other blockchain platform and then tell me its overvalued. Also worth noting that LINK has never had a market cap lower than $49m, its comparable. (BTW cool fact - LINK provides the oracle services for EW Chain) **Current Apps and Those in Development** **TEO by Engie** The Energy Origin by Engine is the first app released on Mainnet, Engie are a $65B French global energy company. The Energy Origin (TEO) is a startup incubated within Engie since September 2018 accompanying customers towards the 3 X 100% goals for the future of energy systems 100% renewables, 100% time, 100% local. TEO focuses on turning energy data into clear, compelling and trustable products through the use of Blockchain Technology. TEO commercializes an innovative solution to certify green energy production and consumption allowing customers to choose where their green electricity comes from and trace it back to its origin. The TEO dApp leverages blockchain to improve the traceability and transparency of green energy, while also expanding the capabilities of supply-demand matching between renewable generators and corporate buyers, such as by choosing green energy on the basis of type of renewable energy, geographic distance from a given facility, and amount of carbon offsets. URL URL **PTT Thailand** The second app that is scheduled to go live on mainnet is built by Thai Energy company PTT, revenue $53B. Due to go live in May 2020. Bangkok, Thailand, and Zug, Switzerland  September 11, 2019  Today, Thailand-based multinational energy conglomerate PTT and global energy blockchain nonprofit Energy Web Foundation (EWF) jointly announced the development of a new blockchain-based renewables platform. The application will be built on the Energy Web Chain and leverage the EW Origin family of open-source software development toolkits to create a regional solution compliant with the International REC Standard (I-REC). PTT is responding to strong corporate demand for renewable energy certificate (REC) options in Thailand and the broader ASEAN region. Multinational corporations are looking to buy regionally sourced RECs matched to their demand from existing and new facilities in the region. To date, Thailand and the ASEAN market more generally have largely been an untapped market for I-RECs. In 2018, some 1.2 billion energy attribute certificates (EACs) were traded globally. Yet renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the United States and guarantees of origin (GOs) in Europe accounted for the overwhelming majority of global EAC market activity. The ASEAN region only had about 5 million MWh of certified I-RECs, which represents less than one-half of one percent of global EAC markets. URL URL **Shell** Shell wholly owned subsidiary Sonnen are building a digital power plant on the the EWF ecosystem. (Shell themselves are a validator) Zug, Switzerland  March 12, 2020  Today the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) announced that the sonnen Group (sonnen) has unveiled a new virtual power plant (VPP) in northeastern Germany that leverages the Energy Web Chain and the EW Origin suite of software development toolkits (SDKs). A network of distributed residential energy storage systems comprise the VPP, which is used to absorb surplus wind generation and thus avoid curtailment of renewable energy by charging the batteries when wind energy is abundant. With a flexibility market for renewable energies and the automatic exchange of supply and demand via the digital exchange EW Origin, we are realising the next step towards a smart grid that can deal much more flexibly with fluctuations from renewable energy, says Jean-Baptiste Cornefert, Managing Director of sonnen eServices. Virtual power plants such as those from sonnen are the technical building block for this power grid that has been missing up to now and can help to ensure that less green energy is lost.

And why are Enterprises adopting it at mass scale?",11,d1eoj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/d1eoj9/what_is_quant_networks_blockchain_operating/,2019-09-09 04:22:27," Overledger is the worlds first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only inter-connects blockchains but also existing enterprise platforms, applications and networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as mApps. In less than 10 months since launching Overledger they have provided interoperability with the full range of DLT technologies from all the leading Enterprise Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger, R3s Corda, JP Morgans Quorum, permissioned variants of Ethereum and Ripple (XRPL) as well as the leading Public Permissionless blockchains / DAGs such as Bitcoin, Stellar, Ethereum, IOTA and EOS as well as the most recent blockchain to get added Binance Chain. In addition, Overledger also connects to Existing Networks / Off Chain / Oracle functionality and it does all of this in a way that is hugely scalable, without imposing restrictions / requiring blockchains to fork their code and can easily integrate into existing applications / networks by just adding 3 lines of code. &amp;#x200B; URL # What is a blockchain Operating system? You will be familiar with Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Apple Mac OS, Googles Android etc but these are all Hardware based Operating Systems. Hardware based Operating Systems provide a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the hardware resources such as CPU, Memory, Storage, Mouse, Keyboard, Video etc so software can easily integrate with it. It provides interoperability between the Hardware devices and Software. Overledger is a Blockchain Operating System, it provides a platform to build and use applications that abstracts all of the complexities involved with integrating with all the different blockchains, different OP\_Codes being used, messaging formats etc as well as connecting to existing non-blockchain networks. It provides interoperability between Blockchains, Existing Networks and Software / MAPPs # How is Overledger different to other interoperability projects? Other projects are trying to achieve interoperability by adding another blockchain on top of existing blockchains. This adds a lot of overhead, complexity, and technical risk. There are a few variants but essentially they either need to create custom connectors for each connected blockchain and / or require connected chains to fork their code to enable interoperability. An example of the process can be seen below: User sends transaction to a multi sig contract on Blockchain A, wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain A A custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the smart contract on Blockchain A. Once they see the transaction, they then sign a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain as proof the event has happened on Blockchain A. Wait for consensus to be reached on the Interoperability Blockchain. The DAPP running on the Interoperability Blockchain is then updated with the info about the transaction occurring on Blockchain A and then signs a transaction on the Interoperability blockchain to a multi sig contract on the Interoperability Blockchain. Wait for consensus to be reached on the interoperability Blockchain. A different custom connector consisting of Off Chain Relay Nodes are monitoring transactions sent to the Smart Contract on the Interoperability Blockchain which are destined for Blockchain B. Once they see the transaction, they sign a transaction on Blockchain B. Wait for consensus to be reached on Blockchain B. URL Other solutions require every connecting blockchain to fork their code and implement their Interoperability protocol. This means the same type of connector can be used instead of a custom one for every blockchain however every connected blockchain has to fork their code to implement the protocol. This enforces a lot of restrictions on what the connected blockchains can implement going forward. &amp;#x200B; URL Some problems with these methods: * **They add a lot of Overhead / Latency**. Rather than just having the consensus of Blockchain A and B, you add the consensus mechanism of the Interoperability Blockchain as well. * **Decentralisation / transaction security is reduced**. If Blockchain A and Blockchain B each have 1,000 nodes validating transactions, yet the Interoperability Blockchain only has 100 nodes then you have reduced the security of the transaction from being validated by 1000 to validated by 100. * **Security of the Interoperability Blockchain must be greater than the sum of all transactions going through it**. JP Morgan transfer $6 Trillion every day, if they move that onto blockchain and need interoperability between two Permissioned blockchains that have to connect via a public Interoperability blockchain, then it would always have to be more costly to attack the blockchain than the value from stealing the funds transacted through the blockchain. * **Imposes a lot of limitations on connected blockchains to fork their code** which may mean they have to drop some existing functionality as well as prevent them from adding certain features in the future. * **Creates a single point of failure**  If the Interoperability blockchain or connector has an issue then this affects each connected blockchain. * **It doesnt scale and acts as a bottleneck.** Not only does building complex custom connectors not scale but the Interoperability blockchain that they are forcing all transactions to go through has to be faster than the combined throughput of connected blockchains. These Interoperability blockchains have limited tps, with the most being around 200 and is a trade off between performance and decentralisation. # But some Interoperability blockchains say they are infinitely scalable? If the interoperability blockchain is limited to say 200 tps then the idea is to just have multiple instances of the blockchain and run them in parallel, so you benefit from the aggregated tps, but just how feasible is that? Lets say you want to connect Corda (capable of 2000+ tps) to Hyperledger (capable of up to 20,000 tps with recent upgrade). (Permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger and Corda arent one big blockchain like say Bitcoin or Ethereum, they have separate instances for each consortium and each is capable of those speeds). So even when you have just 1 DAPP from one consortium that wants to connect Corda to Hyperledger and use 2000 tps for their DAPP, you would need 100 instances of the Interoperability blockchain, each with their own validators (which maybe 100200 nodes each). So, 1 DAPP would need to cover the costs for 100 instances of the blockchain and running costs for 10,000 nodesThis is just one DAPP connected to one instance of a two permissioned blockchains, which are still in the early stages. Other blockchains such as Red Belly Blockchain can achieve 440,000 tps, and this will surely increase as the technology matures. There is also the added complexity of then aggregating the results / co-coordinating between the different instances of the blockchain. Then there are the environmental concerns, the power required for all of these instances / nodes is not sustainable. &amp;#x200B; URL Its not just transactions per second of the blockchain as well, its the latency of all these added consensuses along the path to reach to the destination and not knowing whether the security of each of the hops is sufficient and can be trusted. To see examples of how this potential issue as well as others effect Cosmos you can see my article [here](URL I recommend also reading a blog done by the CEO of Quant, Gilbert Verdian, which explains how Overledger differs [here](URL as well as detailed in the whitepaper [here](URL &amp;#x200B; URL # Overledgers approach In 1973 Vint Cerf invented the protocol that rules them all: [TCP/IP](URL Most people have never heard of it. But it describes the fundamental architecture of the internet, and it made possible Wi-Fi, Ethernet, LANs, the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, 3G/4G  as well as all of the inventions built upon those inventions. &gt;***Wired: So from the beginning, people, including yourself, had a vision of where the internet was going to go. Are you surprised, though, that at this point the IP protocol seems to beat almost anything it comes up against?*** *Cerf: Im not surprised at all because we designed it to do that.* *This was very conscious. Something we did right at the very beginning, when we were writing the specifications, we wanted to make this a future-proof protocol. And so the tactic that we used to achieve that was to say that the protocol did not know how  the packets of the internet protocol layer didnt know how they were being carried. And they didnt care whether it was a satellite link or mobile radio link or an optical fiber or something else.* *We were very, very careful to isolate that protocol layer from any detailed knowledge of how it was being carried. Plainly, the software had to know how to inject it into a radio link, or inject it into an optical fiber, or inject it into a satellite connection. But the basic protocol didnt know how that worked.* *And the other thing that we did was to make sure that the network didnt know what the packets had in them. We didnt encrypt them to prevent it from knowing  we just didnt make it have to know anything. Its just a bag of bits as far as the net was concerned.* *We were very successful in these two design features, because every time a new kind of communications technology came along, like frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode or passive optical networking or mobile radio all of these different ways of communicating could carry internet packets.* *We would hear people saying, The internet will be replaced by X25, or The internet will be replaced by frame relay, or The internet will be replaced by APM, or The internet will be replaced by add-and-drop multiplexers.* *Of course, the answer is, No, it wont. It just runs on top of everything. And that was by design. Im actually very proud of the fact that we thought of that and carefully designed that capability into the system.* This is the approach Quant have taken with their Blockchain OS, Overledger to solve Blockchain interoperability. Compared to other Interoperability platforms that are trying to achieve interoperability at the transaction layer by connecting two blockchains via another blockchain, these will be ultimately be made redundant once faster methods are released. Overledger is designed to be future proof by isolating the layers so it doesnt matter whether its a permissioned blockchain, permissionless, DAG, Legacy network, POW, POS etc because it abstracts the transaction layer from the messaging layer and runs on top of blockchains. Just as the Internet wasnt replaced by X25, frame relay, APM etc, Overledger is designed to be future proof as it just runs on top of the Blockchains rather than being a blockchain itself. So, if a new blockchain technology comes out that is capable of 100,000 TPS then it can easily be integrated as Overledger just runs on top of it. Likewise, with protocols such as HTTPS, SSH etc these will also emerge for blockchains such as ZK-Snarks and other privacy implementations as well as other features made available, all will be compatible with Overledger as its just sitting on top rather than forcing their own implementation for all. It doesnt require blockchains to fork their code to make it compatible, it doesnt add the overhead of adding another blockchain with another consensus mechanism (most likely multiple as it has to go through many hops). All of this adds a lot of latency and restrictions which isnt needed. The developer can just choose which blockchains they want to connect and use the consensus mechanisms of those blockchains rather than forced to use one. Overledger can provide truly internet scale to meet whatever the demands may be, whether that be connecting multiple red belly blockchains together with 440,000 tps it doesnt matter as it doesnt add its consensus mechanism and uses proven internet scale technology such as that based on Kubernetes, which is where each task is split up into a self-contained container and each task is scaled out by deploying more to meet demand. Kubernetes is what runs Google Search engine where they scale up and down billions of containers every week. Due to this being more of a summary, I strongly recommend you read [this article](URL which goes into detail about the different layers in Overledger. &amp;#x200B; URL # But how does it provide the security of a blockchain if it doesnt add its own blockchain? This is often misunderstood by people. Overledger is not a blockchain however it still uses a blockchain for security, immutability, traceability etc, just rather than force people to use their own blockchain, it utilises the source and destination blockchains instead. The key thing to understand is the use of its patented technology TrustTag, which was made freely available to anyone with the Overledger SDK. Please see [this article](URL which explains TrustTag in detail with examples showing how hashing / digital signatures work etc A quick overview is if i want to send data from one blockchain to another the Overledger SDK using Trusttag will put the data through a hashing algorithm. The Hash is then included in digital signature as part of the transaction which is signed by the users private key and then validated through normal consensus and stored as metadata on the source blockchain. The message is then sent to the MAPP off chain. The MAPP periodically scans the blockchains and puts the received message through a hashing algorithm and compares the Hash to the one stored as metadata on the blockchain. This ensures that the message hasnt been modified in transit, the message is encrypted and only the Hash is stored on chain so completely private, provides immutability as it was signed by the users private key which only they have and is stored on the blockchain for high availability and secure so that it cant be modified, with the ability to refer back to it at any point in time. Despite Overledger being a very secure platform, with the team having a very strong security background such as Gilbert who was chief security information officer for Vocalink (Bank of England) managing 6 trillion of payments every year and classified as national critical security (highest level you can get), ultimately you dont need to trust Overledger. Transactions are signed and encrypted at client side, so Overledger has no way of being able to see the contents. It cant modify any transaction as the digital signature which includes a hash of the transaction would be different so would get rejected. Transaction security isnt reduced as it is signed at source using however many nodes the source blockchain has rather than a smaller amount of nodes with an interoperability blockchain in the middle. # Patents The core code of Overledger is closed source and patented, one of the recent patents can be seen [here](URL along with TrustTag and further ones are being filed. The Overledger SDK is open source and is available in Java and Javascript currently, with plans to support Pyhton and Ruby in the near future. Java and Javascript are the most popular programming languages used today. The Blockchain connectors are also open source and this allows the community to create connectors to connect their favourite blockchain so that it can benefit from blockchain interoperability and making it available to all enterprises / developers currently utilising Overledger. Creating is currently taking around a week to implement and so far, have been added based upon client demand. # Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs) Multi Chain Applications (MAPPs) enable an application to use multiple blockchains and interoperate between them. Treaty Contracts enable a developer to build a MAPP and then change the underlying blockchain it uses with just a quick change of couple of lines of code. This is vital for enterprises as its still early days in Blockchian and we dont know which are going to be the best blockchain in the future. Overledger easily integrates into existing applications using the Overledger SDK by just adding 3 lines of code. They dont need to completely rewrite the application like you do with the majority of other projects and all existing java / javascript apps on Windows / Mobile app stores / business applications etc can easily integrate with overledger with minimal changes in just 8 minutes. # Treaty Contracts What Overledger will allow with Treaty contracts is to use popular programming languages such as Java and create a smart contract in Overledger that interacts with all of the connected blockchains. **Even providing Smart contract functionality to blockchains that dont support them such as Bitcoin.** This means that developers dont have to create all the smart contracts on each blockchain in all the different programming languages but instead just create them in Overledger using languages such as Java that are widely used today. If they need to use a different blockchain then it can be as easy as changing a line of code rather than having to completely rewrite the smart contracts. Overledger isnt a blockchain though, so how can it trusted with the smart contract? A Hash of the smart contract is published on any blockchain the MAPP developer requires and when called the smart contract is run its run through a hashing function to check that it matches the Hash value stored on the blockchain, ensuring that it has not been modified. By running the Smart contract off chain this also increases Scalability enormously. With a blockchain all nodes have to run the smart contract one after another rather than in parallel. Not only do you get the performance benefit of not having to run the code against every single node but you can also run them in parallel to others executing smart contracts. You can read more about Treaty Contracts [here](URL # The different versions of Overledger ## Enterprise version The current live version is the Enterprise version as that is where most of the adoption is taking place in blockchain due to permissioned blockchains being preferred until permissionless blockchains resolve the scalability, privacy and regulatory issues. Please see [this article](URL which goes into more details about Entereprise blockchain / adoption. The Enterprise version connects to permissioned blockchains as well as additional features / support suited for Enterprises. ## Community version The community version is due to be released later this year which will allow developers to benefit from creating MAPPs across permissionless blockchains. Developers can publish their MAPPs on the MAPP Store to create additional revenue streams for developers. # Where does Overledger run from? Is it Centralised? Overledger can run from anywhere. The community version will have instances across multiple public clouds, Enterprises / developers may prefer to host the infrastructure themselves within a consortium which they can and are doing. For example SIA is the leading private Financial Network provider in Europe, it provides a dedicated high speed network which connects all the major banks, central banks, trading venues etc. SIA host Overledger within their private network so that all of those clients can access it in the confinement of their heavily regulated, secure, fast network. AUCloud / UKCLoud host Overledger in their environment to offer as a service to their clients which consist of Governments and critical national infrastructure. For Blockchain nodes that interact with Overledger the choice is entirely up to the developer. Each member within a consortium may choose to host a node, some developers may prefer to use 3rd party hosting providers such as Infura, or Quant can also host them if they prefer, its entirely their choice. Overledger allows for higher levels of decentralisation by storing the output across multiple blockchains so you not only benefit from the decentralisation of one blockchain but the combination of all of them. Ultimately though decentralisation is thrown around too much without many actually understanding what it means. Its impossible to have complete decentralisation, when you sign a transaction to be added to a blockchain ultimately you still connect through a single ISP, connect through a single router, or the input into a transaction is done through a piece of software etc. What matters to be decentralised is where trust is involved. As i have mentioned before you dont need to trust the OS, its just providing instructions on how to interact with the blockchains, the end user is signing the transactions / encrypting at client side. Nothing can be seen or modified with the OS. Even if somehow the transaction did get modified then it would get rejected when consensus is done as the hash / digital signature wont match at the destination blockchain. Where the transaction actually gets put onto the blockchain is where decentralisation matters, because thats what needs to be trusted and conensus is reached and Overledger enables this to be written across multiple blockchains at the same time. # The Team The team are very well connected with a wealth of experience at very senior roles at Global enterprises which I will include a few examples below. Gilbert Verdian the CEO was the Head of security for the payment infrastructure for the Bank of England through his CISO role with Vocalink (Mastercard)managing 6 trillion every year. This is treated by the government as critical national infrastructure which is the highest level of criticallity because its so fundamental to the security of the country. They have experience and know what it takes to run a secure financial infrastructure and meeting requirements of regulators. Gilbert was director for Cybersecurity at PWC, Security for HSBC and Ernst &amp; Young as well as various government roles such as the CISO for the Australian NSW Health, Head of Security at the UK government for Ministry of Justice and HM Treasury in addition to being part of the committee for the European Commission, US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Cecilia Harvey is the Chief Operating Officer, where she was previously a Director at HSBC in Global Banking and Markets and before that Director at Vocalink. Cecilia was also Chief Operating Officer at Citi for Markets and Securities Services Technology as well as working for Barclays, Accenture, IBM and Morgan Stanley. Vijay Verma is the Overledger platform lead with over 15 years of developer experience in latest technologies like Java, Scala, Blockchain &amp; enterprise technology solutions. Over the course of his career, he has worked for a number of prestigious organisations including J&amp;J, Deutsche, HSBC, BNP Paribas, UBS Banks, HMRC and Network Rail. Guy Dietrich, the managing director of Rockefeller Capital (manages $19 Billion in assets) has joined the board of Quant Network, and has recently personally attended meetings with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) with Gilbert &amp;#x200B; URL As well as advisors such as Paolo Tasca, the founder and Executive Director of the Centre for Blockchain Technologies (UCL CBT) at University College Londonfounder and executive director as well as Chris Adelsbach, Managing Director at [Techstars](URL the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed.

Meet ROKKEX  the cryptocurrency exchange with a focus on cybersecurity! Its live! ROKKEX Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform Introduction The current cryptocurrency exchange industry is mostly divided into small, poorly managed, or outdated exchanges and large exchanges with huge volumes, which are usually faked and the cold storage is untransparent. ROKKEX seeks to fill this gap by providing a modern cryptocurrency exchange platform for everyone: the cryptocurrency exchange is both easy and intuitive and at the same time it has the desired functions pack for advanced traders. ROKKEX, the team behind secure revolutionary products, is eager to announce that Cryptocurrency Exchange is live! The new platform is an all-in-one cryptocurrency exchange service  an end-to-end solution aimed at exchanging and trading cryptocurrency in a secure, transparent, and intuitive manner, that adhere to the best practices of KYC and AML. We were enlightened with the idea of building a highly protected and transparent crypto exchange, the one crypto traders and regulators could trust, said Lukas Krikstaponis, CEO of ROKKEX. Initially, ROKKEX Cryptocurrency Exchange will be a single product under the brand, and later, after the forthcoming STO, it will be supplemented with Securities Exchange Platform that will provide exchange services for tokenized securities. ROKKEX Product Features Our exchange is built to meet todays requirements for security, privacy, reliability, and speed. It is both open to cryptocurrency world newbies and friendly to the experienced traders that are tired of all the hassle that they might be facing on other exchange platforms. ROKKEX cryptocurrency exchange is built to provide only the best user experience  fast, simple and secure. Security Security and reliability have been essential areas throughout the entire development cycle. We took extreme care and attention to protect every component of the ROKKEX cryptocurrency exchange, and at the same time, use advanced mechanisms to prevent possible attacks. We went the extra mile not only securing our platform but also securing our users accounts, guiding users towards higher and higher account security levels., noted Evaldas Usas, CISO of ROKKEX. Intuitive Interface One of the most worrisome reasons why people are reluctant to join the cryptocurrency industry is an unfriendly and complicated interface. First, we defined the simplest way to trade cryptocurrency, added descriptions where needed, and then created an advanced trading view which is, as well, simple and user-friendly. Transparency We believe that everything that happens in the cryptocurrency market should be transparent and easily accessible. Thats why our volumes and cold wallet reserves wont be opaque, and everyone will observe how the business is going. Besides, we aim to disclose our team and events in the company as broadly as possible. Ultra-Fast Trading Engine All our technologies were created from scratch, including an incredibly fast trading engine. Designed with scalability in mind from day one the back-end systems can easily adapt to fast-growing traffic, accept and process hundreds of thousands of incoming order placement requests per second without skipping a beat."

Before discussing the partnership in more detail, first lets have a look at SIA for those not familiar. ### About SIA: **SIA** is European leader in the design, creation and management of technology infrastructures and services for Financial Institutions, Central Banks, Corporates and the Public Sector, in the areas of payments, cards, network services and capital markets. SIA Group provides its services in over 50 countries, and also operates through its subsidiaries in Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Hungary and South Africa. The company also has branches in Belgium and the Netherlands, and representation offices in the UK and Poland. &amp;#x200B; URL * In 2018, SIA managed 14 billion institutional services transactions, 7.2 billion card transactions, 3 billion payments, 51.7 billion financial transactions and carried 1,204 terabytes of data on the network. * SIA supported the launch of the new **Samsung Pay** payment system, and also **Alipay** and **WeChat Pay** payment service were activated. Furthermore, the offering of terminals has been enriched with the Android-based smartPOS line, making value-added services available to consumers and merchants. * In 2018, SIA confirmed its role as key technology partner to the **London Stock Exchange Group** and at the end of 2018, **44 trading venues operating in Europe and the United States** were connected to SIAs Financial Ring which enables financial intermediaries to access, via a single high-speed, low-latency network infrastructure, the **main international stock markets using date centers in Milan, Rome, London, Frankfurt, and New York.** &amp;#x200B; ### An Alternative to SWIFT The Eurosystem (compromises of the European Central Bank (ECB) and 19 National Central banks that are using the Euro such as the central banks of Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland etc.) operates the financial market infrastructure for the settlement of payments (TARGET2), TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) and securities (TARGET2-Securities, or T2S). **These platforms form the backbone of the European financial market.** **All European Financial institutions will connect to these services only via the Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway (ESMIG).** The single connectivity gateway to all Target services would provide a simpler and more efficient means to access the key market infrastructures as part of the Eurosystems 2020 Vision strategic plan for the evolution of market infrastructures. SIA, in partnership with Colt Technology Services, (who were acquired by Fidelity Investments  One of the largest asset managers in the world with $2.46 trillion), has won a 10 year tender commissioned by the European Central Bank for the provisioning of connectivity services allowing European central and commercial banks, central depositories, automated clearing houses and other payment service providers to connect directly to Eurosystem market infrastructures through a single access interface (Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway  ESMIG). &gt;*Were particularly proud to have been chosen, in partnership with Colt, as one of the two Network Service Providers for Eurosystem market infrastructures. It represents a prestigious result for technology Made in Italy and confirms SIAs significant ability to compete at international level, also strengthening our role as an innovative partner of central and commercial banks. This award for ESMIG is very important because, for the first time in Europe, all financial institutions have the chance to select the best technological solution in a framework of free competition with considerable benefits in terms of costs and efficiency, and contributes to strengthening cybersecurity and the resilience of strategically important systems,* *commented* [*Nicola Cordone*](URL SIAs Chief Executive Officer.* *Paula Cogan, VP of Enterprise and Capital Markets at Colt, comments: The awarding of the ESMIG tender, seven years after the establishment of the partnership between Colt and SIA, represents a really important milestone for both companies. We are pleased to underpin the infrastructure evolution envisaged by the Vision 2020 program by providing connectivity and messaging solutions for the fully managed T2S platform. Colts network offers high levels of performance, scalability and guaranteed service levels which is why we are the chosen provider for over 650 financial institutions globally, including 18 of the 25 largest banks, more than 50 stock exchanges and 13 European central banks.* &amp;#x200B; URL This is hugely significant. Every European Financial institution will either connect via SIA, in partnership with Colt or via SWIFT (and in many cases they will have connectivity with both) in order to access the Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway, granting access to all RTGS, Securities and Instant Payment transactions for Europe. SIA operates a private closed network and Overledger is being integrated into their private network via SIAChain to enable Blockchain interoperability for every connected European Financial Institution immediately, and all they need to do to start using Overledger is add 3 lines of code. ### SIAChain SIAChain is not a blockchain itself. It is a private infrastructure covering Europe consisting of 570 supernodes within SIAnet. SIAChain was created by SIA to develop, in a secure and protected manner, innovative Blockchain applications based on Distributed Ledger Technology. SIAchain makes a series of business applications available to communities of registered, approved members (be they financial institutions, corporates or public administration bodies) in which transparency, confidentiality and security are guaranteed as shared rules. As part of this agreement, SIA will be making Overledger available to all of its 570 Banks / Central Banks / Trading venues to enable Blockchain Interoperability. SIAnet is the leading Financial Network in Europe with more than 100 Tier 1 banks connected, 30 Stock Exchanges / Trading Venues, covering the entire trading process from pre-trading to post-trading. &amp;#x200B; URL &amp;#x200B; Financial institutions dont send transactions to each other over the public Internet. They operate in heavily regulated environments and require secure, performant private networks with 100% uptime. SIA provide a private network dedicated to Financial institutions, utilising 10 GBps high speed network with extremely low latency of 4ms across huge distances stretching over 186,000 kilometres. This provides a secure, stable network with Guaranteed SLAs and 100% uptime to ensure transactions are received and in a timely manner, able to cope with huge volumes. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL **Supernodes** are hardware appliances deployed on SIA customers premise (or, at request, hosted on SIA Private Cloud) that runs different blockchain nodes such as Corda, Hyperledger and permissioned versions of Ethereum in parallel, with multiple dApps, allowing each customer to join or create Business Networks, each one solving a particular use case. There are currently around 570 supernodes deployed each representing a SIA Customer  Banks, Central Banks, Stock Exchanges etc. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL SIAs main value is the ability to verify that all Supernodes run the **same version** of software for both DLT clients and subscribed dApps. Moreover, SIA **certifies** every single dApp / MAPP provided by Communities and deployed on the platform to minimize security and interoperability issues and operates **auxiliary services** needed by some DLT (Notaries, Orderers, Oracles, etc.) &gt;*The partnership aims to integrate Quant Networks blockchain operating system Overledger into the* [*SIAchain*](URL to enable interoperability, one of the biggest challenges and unmet needs faced by the financial industry to develop and implement blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology based applications spanning different technologies.* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL &gt;*Since the European launch of our private infrastructure SIAchain, we are at the forefront of innovation in blockchain technology with the aim of supporting financial markets with a high-performance and secure architecture and a clear governance model.* *We actively continue on our path of innovation and the achievement of a fully interoperable blockchain network is the foremost objective we want to reach with the collaboration of Quant Network and its disruptive vision on DLT,* *says* [*Daniele Savar*](URL Innovation &amp; Business Solutions Director, SIA.* ### Banks need blockchain Interoperability Towards the end of 2017 SIA announced a Partnership with R3 a banking consortium utilising their Corda platform. Members of the consortium consist of banks such as Bank of America, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Scotiabank, Socit Gnrale, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Toronto-Dominion Bank, U.S. Bancorp, UBS, UniCredit and Wells Fargo There are many other blockchains been utilised with Banks, such as JP Morgans Quorum which is a permissioned variant of Ethereum. JP Morgans Coin would require interoperability with other blockchains being used by Banks such as Corda and Hyperledger. Others include Fnality (previously known as Utility Settlement Coin) who are building tokenized versions of five major fiat currencies in partnership with Clearmatics who are utilising a private version of Ethereum. Banks involved were UBS, Banco Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, Credit Suisse, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Deutsche Bank AG. As well as We.Trade consortium utilising Hyperledger Fabric and is currently in live production consisting of banks such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Nordea, Rabobank, Santander, Societe Generale and UniCredit ### Overledger bringing blockchain interoperability immediately to all 570 Banks / Trading partners The really important thing to understand with this partnership is that SIA will be integrating Overledger into SIAChain. They already have built the network, deployed supernodes at all their customers sites and already have loads of banks using various blockchain applications. With this partnership they now can utilise Overledger to benefit from blockchain interoperability with just 3 lines of code and less than 8 minutes. Companies such as Ripple, Stellar etc have to take years rolling out their infrastructure / software to individually connect each bank. By SIA Integrating Overledger into SIAChain, all 570 banks / trading partners have access to Overledger instantly. Its also a closed private network so its not like they can just integrate other solutions unless they have been integrated into SIAChain. &gt;*The key is SIAnet and SIAChain is an existing financial infrastructure that already is used and interconnects 570 banks and financial institutions. The access and adoption is already there, all the banks are already connected and using the network. Difference is now, it has Overledger.* &gt; &gt;*It would have taken us 10+ years to onboard 570 banks one by one and build the infrastructure. This is where Ripple, Stellar (IBM) are stuck and adoption will take many years to individually connect each bank. We already have all of them connected now.* ### Spunta Banca SIAchain was selected for the operational testing of the Spunta Banca project  coordinated by ABI Lab, the research and innovation center promoted by the Italian Banking Association  based on blockchain technology that involved 18 Italian banks performing a proof of concept with excellent results. This has now progressed to technical tests with 200 banks and 200 million data items for a year before going into production. [Just a couple of days ago](URL an update of the Agreement for the maintenance of reciprocal accounts between banks with regard to the interbank check was approved, this allows the development of the check process using Distributed ledger technology (DLT), starting from 1st March 2020. It is therefore a blockchain for banks operating in Italy. &amp;#x200B; URL ### FINSEC Project funded by Horizon 2020 FINSEC, (Integrated Framework for Predictive and Collaborative Security of Financial Infrastructures), is a flagship project which will develop, demonstrate and bring to market an integrated, intelligent, collaborative and predictive approach to the security of critical infrastructures in the financial sector. FINSEC will provide a blueprint for the next generation security systems for the critical infrastructures of the financial sector. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; URL The FINSEC project will provide tools for stakeholders collaboration in the financial supply chain to leverage the results of the previous tasks, while supportin gassets modelling and interrelationships for financial services involving multiple participants, such as SWIFT network interactions. The blockchain will be established and will operate in a fully decentralized manner,i.e. it will not be under the control of any administrative entity. Nevertheless, each participating entity (e.g., a bank or another financial institution) will interface to the blockchain infrastructure through a ledger client application, which shall make use of a blockchain API enabling the execution of the chain code. The entire data sharing process will be driven by a data model: the latter will specify the subset of security information that will be shared by each blockchain participant &amp;#x200B; URL ### Game Changer for Quant Network and for Blockchain Mass Adoption by Financial Institutions This is a game changer for Quant, SIA are integrating Overledger into the leading financial private network in Europe enabling blockchain interoperability to all of its 570 Banks, Central Banks, Stock Exchanges, Trading venues etc immediately. Not having to spend years rolling our infrastructure / software, they can all benefit today. This number will only increase with the recent news that SIA, in partnership with Colt Technology Services, has won a 10 year tender commissioned by the European Central Bank for the provisioning of connectivity services allowing European central and commercial banks, central depositories, automated clearing houses and other payment service providers to connect directly to Eurosystem market infrastructures through a single access interface (Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway  ESMIG).

There are currently around 570 supernodes deployed each representing a SIA Customer  Banks, Central Banks, Stock Exchanges etc. URL SIAs main value is the ability to verify that all Supernodes run the **same version** of software for both DLT clients and subscribed dApps. Moreover, SIA **certifies** every single dApp / MAPP provided by Communities and deployed on the platform to minimize security and interoperability issues and operates **auxiliary services** needed by some DLT (Notaries, Orderers, Oracles, etc.) &gt;*The partnership aims to integrate Quant Networks blockchain operating system Overledger into the* [*SIAchain*](URL to enable interoperability, one of the biggest challenges and unmet needs faced by the financial industry to develop and implement blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology based applications spanning different technologies.* &amp;#x200B; URL &gt;*Since the European launch of our private infrastructure SIAchain, we are at the forefront of innovation in blockchain technology with the aim of supporting financial markets with a high-performance and secure architecture and a clear governance model.* *We actively continue on our path of innovation and the achievement of a fully interoperable blockchain network is the foremost objective we want to reach with the collaboration of Quant Network and its disruptive vision on DLT,* *says* [*Daniele Savar*](URL Innovation &amp; Business Solutions Director, SIA.* ## Banks need blockchain Interoperability Towards the end of 2017 SIA announced a Partnership with R3 a banking consortium utilising their Corda platform. Members of the consortium consist of banks such as Bank of America, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mizuho Bank, National Australia Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Scotiabank, Socit Gnrale, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Toronto-Dominion Bank, U.S. Bancorp, UBS, UniCredit and Wells Fargo There are many other blockchains been utilised with Banks, such as JP Morgans Quorum which is a permissioned variant of Ethereum. JP Morgans Coin would require interoperability with other blockchains being used by Banks such as Corda and Hyperledger. Others include Fnality (previously known as Utility Settlement Coin) who are building tokenized versions of five major fiat currencies in partnership with Clearmatics who are utilising a private version of Ethereum. Banks involved were UBS, Banco Santander, Bank of New York Mellon, State Street, Credit Suisse, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Deutsche Bank AG. As well as We.Trade consortium utilising Hyperledger Fabric and is currently in live production consisting of banks such as Deutsche Bank, HSBC, KBC, Natixis, Nordea, Rabobank, Santander, Societe Generale and UniCredit ## Overledger bringing blockchain interoperability immediately to all 570 Banks / Trading partners The really important thing to understand with this partnership is that SIA will be integrating Overledger into SIAChain. They already have built the network, deployed supernodes at all their customers sites and already have loads of banks using various blockchain applications. With this partnership they now can utilise Overledger to benefit from blockchain interoperability with just 3 lines of code and less than 8 minutes. Companies such as Ripple, Stellar etc have to take years rolling out their infrastructure / software to individually connect each bank. By SIA Integrating Overledger into SIAChain, all 570 banks / trading partners have access to Overledger instantly. Its also a closed private network so its not like they can just integrate other solutions unless they have been integrated into SIAChain. &gt;*The key is SIAnet and SIAChain is an existing financial infrastructure that already is used and interconnects 570 banks and financial institutions. The access and adoption is already there, all the banks are already connected and using the network. Difference is now, it has Overledger.* &gt; &gt;*It would have taken us 10+ years to onboard 570 banks one by one and build the infrastructure. This is where Ripple, Stellar (IBM) are stuck and adoption will take many years to individually connect each bank. We already have all of them connected now.* ## Spunta Banca SIAchain was selected for the operational testing of the Spunta Banca project  coordinated by ABI Lab, the research and innovation center promoted by the Italian Banking Association  based on blockchain technology that involved 18 Italian banks performing a proof of concept with excellent results. This has now progressed to technical tests with 200 banks and 200 million data items for a year before going into production. [URL [Just a couple of days ago](URL an update of the Agreement for the maintenance of reciprocal accounts between banks with regard to the interbank check was approved, this allows the development of the check process using Distributed ledger technology (DLT), starting from 1st March 2020. It is therefore a blockchain for banks operating in Italy. URL ## FINSEC Project funded by Horizon 2020 FINSEC, (Integrated Framework for Predictive and Collaborative Security of Financial Infrastructures), is a flagship project which will develop, demonstrate and bring to market an integrated, intelligent, collaborative and predictive approach to the security of critical infrastructures in the financial sector. FINSEC will provide a blueprint for the next generation security systems for the critical infrastructures of the financial sector. &amp;#x200B; URL The FINSEC project will provide tools for stakeholders collaboration in the financial supply chain to leverage the results of the previous tasks, while supportin gassets modelling and interrelationships for financial services involving multiple participants, such as SWIFT network interactions. The blockchain will be established and will operate in a fully decentralized manner,i.e. it will not be under the control of any administrative entity. Nevertheless, each participating entity (e.g., a bank or another financial institution) will interface to the blockchain infrastructure through a ledger client application, which shall make use of a blockchain API enabling the execution of the chain code. The entire data sharing process will be driven by a data model: the latter will specify the subset of security information that will be shared by each blockchain participant &amp;#x200B; ## Game Changer for Quant Network and for Blockchain Mass Adoption by Financial Institutions This is a game changer for Quant, SIA are integrating Overledger into the leading financial private network in Europe enabling blockchain interoperability to all of its 570 Banks, Central Banks, Stock Exchanges, Trading venues etc immediately. Not having to spend years rolling our infrastructure / software, they can all benefit today. This number will only increase with the recent news that SIA, in partnership with Colt Technology Services, has won a 10 year tender commissioned by the European Central Bank for the provisioning of connectivity services allowing European central and commercial banks, central depositories, automated clearing houses and other payment service providers to connect directly to Eurosystem market infrastructures through a single access interface (Eurosystem Single Market Infrastructure Gateway  ESMIG).

[URL &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; &gt;So what weve done is instead of just announcing one client and one thing, were announcing that were working with SIA. So, SIA is leading European payment infrastructure. And what were doing with SIA is interconnecting blockchain networks with SIA, and doing settlements, which are central bank settlements, with the central bank in Italy. So what Overledger is doing is were actually bringing blockchain and interoperability to all of SIAs clients, which are 580 banks.

The 1st phase of QNT was to help create an ecosystem of developers and enterprise. The 2nd phase, QNT has been used to verify and the option to sign and encrypt every single transaction that flows through Overledger for security purposes. The 3rd phase of QNT is something we've been working on. It's to be used for the movement of Digital Assets across chains. QNT is a Universal Utility Token, providing access to the Overledger ecosystem and also to be used to pay for transactions and usage across chains. We're also going to enforce mimimum wallet holdings for all participants. &gt; &gt;This is a market need we're seeing with clients and a tokenised ecosystem is the future we're all working towards. This is something we can do now, where others have been trying to achieve for the last couple of years. &gt; &gt;We have clients we're working with in financial services that are moving digital assets internally within a permissioned network and want to be able to interoperate with other parties to recognise their digital asset on different internal permissioned chains. Plus they also want to be able to move and settle on public permissionless blockchains safely and securely - Overledger is the only technology that can do this today. &amp;#x200B; &gt;This is a game changer we've been working on. We're bringing blockchain interoperability to the 570 banks that SIA work with. &gt; &gt;We want users with volume - if we're powering the digital asset economy with QNT this is a game changer in this space. This is what Ripple with XRP, Stellar with XLM and partnering with IBM have been trying to do - Gilbert from Telegram &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; QNT is used to validate with the option to sign and encrypt every transaction that flows through Overledger. No Transactions can No 3rd Party can view or tamper with transactions and their contents, including Quant when signed and encrypted Enterprises and community developers need to purchase an annual license to develop apps on the platform Consumption fees such as read / write to overledger are paid in QNT Moving of digital assets across chains whether permissioned or permissionless will require QNT The license fees are based on a fixed FIAT Value and the equivilant number of QNT are purchased and taken out of circulation for 12 months. Once the license is renewed after 12 months the tokens remain locked out of circulation Users will need to hold a minimum amount of QNT to use Overledger. &amp;#x200B; Quant have released the Quant Enterprise Treasury which allows Enterprises to pay for license fees in FIAT and the treasury automatically converts them into QNT. The treasury gets the tokens from Exchanges / OTC. &amp;#x200B; QNT has a total supply which is 1/3 less than Bitcoin's total supply at only 14.6 million QNT. Unlike Bitcoin currently you don't have to wait till 2140 for all of the tokens to be in circulation. All QNT is in circulation, there is no inflation and no new tokens will be minted. &amp;#x200B; Unlike with Ripple where the majority of partnered banks don't actually use XRP, all banks that use Overledger will use QNT. Ripple is valued at $17.7 Billion and 42 Billion XRP are in circulation. There is another 58 Billion XRP which is due to come into circulation via inflation. (If you take that into account at todays prices that's a total market cap of $42 Billion &amp;#x200B; ATOM (The token for the Cosmos Hub) is only used for staking and transactions for the Cosmos hub and not the entire Cosmos ecosystem. There will be many hubs each with their own token. Cosmos interoperability protocol IBC is still in reasearch phase and can't connect the hub to zones within the cosmos ecosystem). Also to encourage staking it is designed to be hyperinflationary by having a yearly inflation of between 7 and 20%. This makes ATOM a depreciating asset and to combat this you need to stake your ATOM (which you receive more ATOM as a reward for the loss of value per token). Another way to look at it is if the Market cap stayed the same at 1 Billion over 10 years the value of each ATOM would drop from 4.23 to 0.68 (**-83.92%**). &amp;#x200B; The other thing to consider is that whilst they may not be popular on here, permissioned blockchains are going to far more widely used over the next couple of years than public blockchains for Enterprises. This is because public blockchains currently lack many features - speed, privacy, as well as regulation involved with being decentralised etc. Thats not to say it won't shift towards public blockchains in the future but not in the next couple of years. (Just have to look at the number of permissioned blockchains being used in Forbes recent blockchain 50 list to see this. Whilst permissioned blockchains don't need Gas and so don't have their own token. Even if enterprises are only using permissioned blockchains to interoperabte between them, they will need QNT. &amp;#x200B; QNT with all of its token in circulation, no inflation, better tokenomics than many, wide usage in short and long term connecting to permissioned and public blockchains as well as sitll on the 2nd page on Coinmarket cap &amp;#x200B; # Other: &amp;#x200B; * Gilbert Verdian founded the ISO TC 307 Standard for Blockchain which 54 countries are working towards currently - [URL * Open Source SDK's available in popular programming languages such as Java and Javascript. * Treaty Contracts will allow developers to build MAPPS that can interoperate with multiple blockchains without having to write the smart contract for every blockchain in each of their programming languages - solidity for Eth, Go etc. Treaty Contracts will also enable smart contract capability to be used on blockchains that don't support smart contracts such as Bitcoin * Quant provides easy Off Chain / Oracle functionality with just the addition of 3 lines of code to their existing applications. Meaning developers don't need to rewrite their applications to work with blockchain. * Quant have launched multiple products that use Overledger - GoVerify - Protects people from impersonation and deception fraud and Quant ATLAS - their solution to enable interoperable banking through cross border open banking. * Overledger can connect to any blockchain / DAG / Permissioned or permissionless and is designed to be future proof by isolating the layers so they dont care which blockchain is being used, what consensus method etc, each layer is only interested with the data within that same layer * It uses proven Internet Scale infastructure and can operate in either a centralised manner or decentralised with the addition of Hosted Overledger gateways (with details being released later this year) &amp;#x200B; **Would you like to connect your favourite blockchain to Overledger so that you have access to all of these enterprises / developers / clients to use?

The 1st phase of QNT was to help create an ecosystem of developers and enterprise. The 2nd phase, QNT has been used to verify and the option to sign and encrypt every single transaction that flows through Overledger for security purposes. The 3rd phase of QNT is something we've been working on. It's to be used for the movement of Digital Assets across chains. QNT is a Universal Utility Token, providing access to the Overledger ecosystem and also to be used to pay for transactions and usage across chains. We're also going to enforce mimimum wallet holdings for all participants. This is a market need we're seeing with clients and a tokenised ecosystem is the future we're all working towards. This is something we can do now, where others have been trying to achieve for the last couple of years. We have clients we're working with in financial services that are moving digital assets internally within a permissioned network and want to be able to interoperate with other parties to recognise their digital asset on different internal permissioned chains. Plus they also want to be able to move and settle on public permissionless blockchains safely and securely - Overledger is the only technology that can do this today. &gt; &gt;This is a game changer we've been working on. We're bringing blockchain interoperability to the 570 banks that SIA work with. We want users with volume - if we're powering the digital asset economy with QNT this is a game changer in this space. This is what Ripple with XRP, Stellar with XLM and partnering with IBM have been trying to do - Gilbert from Telegram [URL QNT is used to validate with the option to sign and encrypt every transaction that flows through Overledger. No Transactions can No 3rd Party can view or tamper with transactions and their contents, including Quant when signed and encrypted Enterprises and community developers need to purchase an annual license to develop apps on the platform Consumption fees such as read / write to overledger are paid in QNT Moving of digital assets across chains whether permissioned or permissionless will require QNT The license fees are based on a fixed FIAT Value and the equivilant number of QNT are purchased and taken out of circulation for 12 months. Once the license is renewed after 12 months the tokens remain locked out of circulation Users will need to hold a minimum amount of QNT to use Overledger. Quant have released the Quant Enterprise Treasury which allows Enterprises to pay for license fees in FIAT and the treasury automatically converts them into QNT. The treasury gets the tokens from Exchanges / OTC. QNT has a total supply which is 1/3 less than Bitcoin's total supply at only 14.6 million QNT. Unlike Bitcoin currently you don't have to wait till 2140 for all of the tokens to be in circulation. All QNT is in circulation, there is no inflation and no new tokens will be minted. Unlike with Ripple where the majority of partnered banks don't actually use XRP, all banks that use Overledger will use QNT. Ripple is valued at $17.7 Billion and 42 Billion XRP are in circulation. There is another 58 Billion XRP which is due to come into circulation via inflation. (If you take that into account at todays prices that's a total market cap of $42 Billion The other thing to consider is that whilst they may not be popular on here, permissioned blockchains are going to far more widely used over the next couple of years than public blockchains for Enterprises. This is because public blockchains currently lack many features - speed, privacy, as well as regulation involved with being decentralised etc. Thats not to say it won't shift towards public blockchains in the future but not in the next couple of years. (Just have to look at the number of permissioned blockchains being used in Forbes recent blockchain 50 list to see this. Whilst permissioned blockchains don't need Gas and so don't have their own token. Even if enterprises are only using permissioned blockchains to interoperabte between them, they will need QNT. QNT with all of its token in circulation, no inflation, better tokenomics than many, wide usage in short and long term connecting to permissioned and public blockchains as well as sitll on the 2nd page on Coinmarket cap and hasn't listed on a ""Tier 1"" exchange yet. # Other: * Gilbert Verdian founded the ISO TC 307 Standard for Blockchain which 54 countries are working towards currently -[URL * Open Source SDK's available in popular programming languages such as Java and Javascript. * Treaty Contracts will allow developers to build MAPPS that can interoperate with multiple blockchains without having to write the smart contract for every blockchain in each of their programming languages - solidity for Eth, Go etc. Treaty Contracts will also enable smart contract capability to be used on blockchains that don't support smart contracts such as Bitcoin * Quant provides easy Off Chain / Oracle functionality with just the addition of 3 lines of code to their existing applications.

Normally when carrying out a bounty bug program, accesses and environments are limited so that ""white hackers"" can test vulnerabilities and report them. Limiting this type of activity reduces the risk of a black hacker exploiting a vulnerability with a criminal purpose. To this end, measures are implemented (Monitoring via alerts, perimeter protection, SIEM, etc.). Binance opened a large security hole by allowing a test in a preproduction environment which was the same as the production one. This has allowed bugs to be found that could be exploited in productive environments in the same way. A poorly done bounty bug is a shot to yourself, in this case I think it has been what happened. A badly done limitation allows external users to discover more errors than they should without the platform owner having control over it."

I think the project's flown beneath the radar for many! Here's the low-down: # Intro The CEO [Gilbert Verdian](URL [founded](URL the ISO TC307 standard for blockchain in April 2016, where [52 countries now collaborate](URL to implement a standard that will be adopted globally. Standards are a pivotal component to adoption, as they essentially represent a commitment made by numerous entities to use a particular technology or format. A key [aim of standardisation](URL is to ensure interoperability between multiple DLT/Blockchain implementations and, in doing so, reduce the risk of a fragmented ecosystem. Gilbert Verdian is the chairman of the SG7 workgroup on ""Interoperability of blockchain and distributed ledger technology systems"". Work into the standard is ongoing and it is planned to be finalised [no later than 2021](URL *Processing img 6igz8bjm9wk21...* [Quant Network](URL aims to provide the technology for enterprise and startups to take advantage of DLT's, by making it possible to connect to blockchains using just 3 lines of code in less than 8 minutes. Unlike other interoperability solutions Overledger [isn't a blockchain](URL and doesnt require fundamental system changes to use the technology. It is more apt to call it a blockchain protocol, comparable to the internet protocol TCP/IP. Overledger facilitates routing between blockchains by using a verification block, which not only helps ensure that consensus times are kept to a minimum, but also handles double spend and forking issues across different ledgers. [ Overledger Architecture Model](URL The team launched Overledger in [November](URL demonstrating 4 multi-chain apps running on Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Hyperledger: * [Part 1](URL video (13min) * [Part 2: mApp Demos](URL video (37min) The product is at full release for the Enterprise version of Overledger for permissioned blockchains. The current open source version will be connected to permissionless blockchains by the summer, currently it's test-net only. Overledger can facilitate cross-chain atomic swaps, and Zero Knowledge Proofs are possible using the teams [patented](URL TrustTag solution: Trusttag allows the tokenisation of assets to be used on the blockchain and to easily connect off chain data to onchain. Interoperability is not just limited to transferring value between blockchains via atomic swaps but messages / data can be used by adding a hash of a message to the metadata of a transaction on any blockchain which facilitates the interoperability without having to add another blockchain by utilising the trust and security of the source blockchain. All communication is encrypted on the client side. Overledger is not affected by forks or updates of underlying blockchains, as it abstracts the messaging layer from the transaction layer, sitting above it. Their ICO finished April last year, followed by a [token burn in September](URL as the team only raised $10-11M of their $40M ask. The ICO Price was $1.51 and pre-sale 94c. The first draft of the [Token utility paper](URL was released in January. The Treasury function will be completed by the second half of the year, so we can probably expect an updated Token utility paper between now and then. Crypto Chico gives a good [3min tech-dive intro](URL and Blockchain Brad has done [3 great interviews](URL Crypto Zombie does [a longer 13min tech-dive](URL # [Team](URL In recent appointments, [Gilbert Verdian](URL was the Chief information security officer (CISO) at NSW Health (Australian Government), Deputy CTO at HM Treasury working with Cabinet Ministers and the Chancellor responsible for securely transforming Central Government Departments including the systems that are critical for the operating and running of the UK economy. Responsibilities covered Downing St, Cabinet Office, Bank of England, Financial Services Authority, and the Debt Management Office. He was also the CTO at UKFI, responsible for rapidly establishing the agency during the financial crisis to take ownership of 350B worth of toxic assets from the banks. As CISO for PayUK, previously NPSO - Nation Payments Scheme Operating, he was responsible for the security for all payments in the UK, 6T per year. In the past, Gilbert worked for the Federal Reserve on their Secure Payments Task Force, founded the, Bank of England Cybersecurity committee, Australian Government, Ministry of Justice, BP, HSBC, and VocaLink (a Mastercard company).

The token protects the service from denial-of-service attacks. QNT is required and locked up as a license to access the network on both public and enterprise (permissioned) chains, is payment for read and write operations and to access multi-chain apps (mApps). Devs can choose to pay for QNT gas on behalf of the user, choosing to monetise their app through a different channel (advertising, fiat subscription etc) - allowing for seamless experiences without the need of Metamask or 3rd party extension. mApp users pay in fiat currency, and the Treasury function handles the purchasing of QNT. In the second half of the year the team plans to decentralise their network by allowing Enterprises and additional Cloud Service Providers, as well as the community the possibility to host an incentivised ""gateway"". It is still to be confirmed how gateway operators would be incentivised, the team is considering a dual token system.

They demo'd 3 working mApps during their Launch on the 20th, and mApps can be implemented in 8 minutes using only 3 lines of code. Among the mApps they demo'd live was""Qoogle"", a blockchain search engine allowing searches across multiple chains, and another mApp that delivered HTML content through blockchains.* *You can find the Live Demos from Quant X (Overledger Launch Event) here:* [*URL # Anyways, here are some key takeaways from their weekly AMA this morning: \- **50+ clients they're working with** **Q**: How many tests (or proof of concepts) are Quant currently running for prospective clients or integrators right now? How many of these are nearing a decision point - in terms of go/no-go decision making? (Understand you cant release client names etc). **A**: We have a very long client list of about 50 clients we've been meeting and speaking to all with different progress and project lifecycles. **- Partnership announcement next week** **Q**: Hi, Gilbert two questions \- Is Quant looking forward in the Cloud space, since Srisson Grigorian(? Sorry ) has plenty of experience with top notch companies such as Salesforce, Microsoft? \- This one is Standards related: Could ISO TC307 tie into ISO 20022's risk mitigation strategies? Assuming the SG7 is up and running **A**:We've had a lot of meetings with Cloud providers to partner with them. In TC307 there is an existing liaison with SC27 which is responsible for ISO27000 series for Standards **Q**: Was this one where they were looking at using overledger as a service or someone else? **A**: Look out for a partnership announcement next week with a Cloud provider that's taking Overledger-as-a-Service to market. We actually finalized the press release today and will release it. It's also very security focused aimed for Government and Military. **- Meeting with one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world** **Q**: What are the teams plans for November and December that are within their direct control e.g. any goals to release updated roadmap and tokenomics updates? **A**: In November and December - we're mainly working on further Overledger enhancements plus client specific use cases. We're releasing HL7 connectivity to interoperate Health systems. Got a meeting with one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world **- Overledger-as-a-service, Company already building mApps &amp; wants to partner** **Q:** What was the feedback from devs and ctos etc in the audience? **A:** We had quite a few discussions. One company has already started building mApps with our SDKs and want to partner with us which is exciting. Another company want to offer Overledger as-a-Service which we're meeting next week to discuss more **- Met with Future Borders team (Irish Border issue)** **Q**:Did you manage to discuss with the government about using overledger as a solution for the irish border? **A**:Yes we've met with Future Borders team on this **- Working closely with Atlantic Power Exchange in Australia** **Q**:I think one of the most exciting ventures for me was the announcement of the partnership working with Alantic Power Exchange - being big fans of Power ledger (go Aussies!) and P2P energy trading etc. Any news regarding the details of Quant's involvement or potential upcoming milestones? **A**:We're working closely.

188,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,SingularityNet And A.I in general a market to watch,1,a2z6c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/a2z6c9/singularitynet_and_ai_in_general_a_market_to_watch/,2018-12-04 20:29:11,"The most underrated crypto in the top 200 (In my opinion) - SingularityNet (AGI), apart from the fact it was one of, if not the fastest selling ICO in crypto selling out all of its $36,000,000 in 60 seconds, here are a list of accomplishments, partnerships with the following Companies and Governments and PR for those that have missed it: Joe Rogan Podcast - With SingularityNets CEO Dr Ben Goertzel - Dec 4th Partnership Entertech - A Chinese A.I Powered Neurotech firm for the consumer and enterprise markets. Collaboration with Government of Malta - SingularityNet have partnered with the Government of Malta to contribute to a new task force Malta.ai Partnership UNESCO - International Bureau of Education (IBE). The bureau's initiative is part of the fourth United Nations sustainable development goal. PR - Sophia the Robot receives Saudi Citizenship, first ever robot to receive citizenship in the world. Partnership Weeve - To facilitate A.I as a service in IOT (Internet of Things) based data marketplaces. Partnership Mindfire - A Swiss non-profit uniting the best A.I talent globally to create human level artificial intelligence. Parody in Silicon Valley Series - Sophia Robot and SingularityNets CEO Ben Goertzel were parodied in the Silicon Valley series in a few episodes. Partnership Kirik - The partnership will enable the advanced A.I analysis of smart contracts in SingularityNet Partnership DBrain - Turning raw data into A.I for businesses. Integrating its data labelling platform for seamless use on SingularityNet. Partnership Shivom - To advance genomic medical research and analytics. PR - Numerous Tv spots with Sophia meeting numerous high profile figures like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel &amp; sports superstar Ronaldo + many more. Partnership DeepBrain Chain (DBC) - Sharing of data and processing of services between platforms. Partnership Bitspace - Working together to create awareness of open decentralised A.I Blockchains. Partnership PHacken - To improve Blockchain based cybersecurity. Partnership FundRequest - SingularityNet is becoming the go to provider of A.I resources for the Blockchain industry. Partnership Nexus - To explore new Blockchain integrations. Integration could result in the most scalable censorship resistant Blockchain infrastructure in existence. Partnership Ocean Protocol - Looking to make full-stack decentralised A.I a reality. Partnership NR Capital - SingularityNet have partnered with Singapore FinTech Firm NR Capital To disrupt supply chain finance via A.I analysis and automation at scale. Partnership SG Innovate - Government owned Private company Singaporean SG Innovates partnership with SingularityNet to drive technology innovation. Collaboration Hanson Robotics - Co founder of SingularityNet and CEO of Hanson Robotics - Dr David Hanson The reason SingularityNet in my opinion is under the radar is because it released 2 days before the whole crypto market crashed back in the beginning of the year, releasing at $0.10 it shot up to $2 in less than 48hrs and straight into the 80s spot with such a small whitelist of only 4000 participants due to the strict KYC application. We can only wonder if the crypto market had not crashed how this token would have been adopted by the masses instead of flying under the radar. The future is in A.I. That's plain to see. Driverless cars, smart homes, mobiles, medical, military, robotics, a part of our every day lives, which is why all the major companies are investing heavily into their A.I Facebook, google, Amazon, tesla, Governments, the list goes on and on and it's growing at an explosive rate. A predicted $16Trillion market within 5-10 years. If SingularityNet can even take a small slice of that pie it would be huge. Being one of the first A.I to Blockchain and the worlds first consumer marketplace for A.I, it's the reason I'm bullish and think this is one of the most underrated projects in crypto currently with possibly also one of the most to gain % wise. Many people on reddit seem to leave out A.I as a market in general to invest in when doing their crypto lists I've noticed, when this is one of the faster growing markets out there. Note - Yes I am a holder of this token and many others if that makes a difference. Just tired of reading posts about the same old tokens over and over again, literally every day you know the posts are going to be about the exact same list of tokens XRP, BTC, IOTA etc etc (Good Projects in themselves) even duplicate posts about the same information... when there are other projects out there doing great work too.

192,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Cryptocurrencies turn largely red as cryptocurrency mining chip manufacturer TSMC forecasts weaker demand in 4Q2018,1,9pjzrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9pjzrw/cryptocurrencies_turn_largely_red_as/,2018-10-20 00:50:41," ### Crypto News * A report released by Moscow-based cybersecurity company, Group-IB, finds that cryptocurrency exchanges have lost USD$882 million to hackers over the last two years. The report goes on to forecast that the trend will likely increase in the future as hackers more directly target cryptocurrency exchanges. The most notable cryptocurrency exchange hack occurred at the beginning of 2018 when Japanese crypto exchange, Coincheck, was robbed of USD$532 million of NEM tokens. The report highlights that some of the busiest hacking groups involved in orchestrating attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges include Lazarus, Cobalt, Silence, and MoneyTaker. The report goes on to detail, In 2019, cryptocurrency exchanges will be a new target for the most aggressive hacker groups usually attacking banks. The number of targeted attacks on crypto exchanges will rise. * A study conducted and published by Glassdoor, a career and recruiting website, finds that cryptocurrency and blockchain related job opportunities have significantly increased in 2018 despite a bearish cryptocurrency market. Glassdoor conducted the study by analyzing a large sample of online US job postings that contained keywords closely related to blockchain, Bitcoin (BTC), and cryptocurrency. According to the report by Glassdoor, as of August 2018, 1,775 job openings existed in the US related to blockchain while, at the same time last year, that number was 446 job openings -- this represents a whopping 300% increase in blockchain and cryptocurrency related job postings. * After Bermudas House of Assembly enacted new crypto and blockchain regulatory framework in July, the government has awarded the countrys first certification for an initial coin offering (ICO). As per the Royal Gazette, Wayne Gaines, Bermudas Minister of National Security, announced while speaking at the Bermuda Executive Forum in Miami that fintech company, Uulala, was awarded the certification. Uulala aims to provide services and increase inclusion for underbanked people through providing financial services and implementing a decentralized peer-to-peer network that would load cash into the digital economy. Funds deposited using Uulala also allow customers access to a virtual MasterCard to participate in e-commerce and to send or receive cross-border payments. * Cryptocurrency mining chip-maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is forecasting weaker demand in 4Q2018 for processors used by cryptocurrency mining hardware. While speaking in their 3Q2018 earnings call, TSMC noted that their revenue will be affected by continued weakness in the cryptocurrency mining market. TSMC is the main supplier for Bitmain, the worlds largest manufacturer of cryptocurrency mining hardware -- in Bitmains initial public offering filing submitted in late September, investors learned that 60% of Bitmains chip supply comes from TSMC. While speaking on the subject, TSMC CEO and Vice Chairman, C.C. Wei said, We estimate our 2018 growth rate will be about 6.5% in US Dollar terms, which is close to the foundry industrys growth but slightly below our 7% to 9% guidance given in the last conference. * Gelfman Blueprint, Inc. and its CEO, Nicholas Gelfman, will more than USD$2.5 million in fines after a New York federal court found the firm guilty of operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme. Gelfman Blueprint maintained 85 clients with 2,367 Bitcoin (BTC) under management as of 2015 after initially launching in 2014. In September 2017, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed an anti-fraud enforcement action against Gelfmann Blueprint after it told investors that it had developed a computer algorithm called Jigsaw, which would generate substantial returns through a commodity fund -- the entirety of the scheme was a fraud. According to an announcement from the CFTC, Gelman Blueprint and CEO Nicholas Gefman stole more than USD$600,000 from at least 80 customers. CEO Nicholas Gelman also constructed a fake computer hack to cover the firms trading losses. * Huobi, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Singapore, has launched a new solution that allows users to switch between four different fiat-pegged stablecoins in the event of price volatility or market fluctuations. Huobi announced in a press release on Friday of HUSD, a medium to facilitate exchanges of different stablecoins. When Huobi users deposit, say, 10 Gemini Dollars (GUSD), they receive 10 HUSD in exchange and their GUSD is essentially placed in a pool of other users GUSD. When users choose to withdraw, they are debited with the stablecoin of their choice that is pulled from the pool of said stablecoin. Robin Zhu, Huobis Chief Operating Office, points out that the solution could potentially run into a problem if the pool is not large enough to cover withdrawals. * Ripple Labs, Inc. and digital payments firm, Coil, have partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to implement Ripples Interledger Protocol to support, pro-poor payment systems. According to data from the World Bank, roughly 1.7 billion adults across the world in 2017 were technically unbanked. Most unbanked individuals are low and middle income earning individuals living in emerging markets without access to clear identification information. * While speaking in an interview with Bloomberg, Galaxy Digital CEO, Michael Novogratz, said that stablecoin Tether (USDT) should do a better job of creating transparency in its operations. Novogratz said, I think Tether didnt do a great job in terms of creating transparency, after which he noted, The concept of stablecoins make sense. Novogratzs comments come days after USDT lost its 1:1 peg to the US Dollar and dipped below USD$0.90/token on many exchanges. **Sources:** r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL"

Roisman took his position as the new SEC Commissioner just last month, and the rumor is - he's pro-cryptocurrency. However, it's not exactly to clear to what extent. What we do know, is when given the chance to speak on cryptocurrencies while at the Senate banking committee - he wasn't among the few who didn't grasp the topic entirely, saying. The SEC must examine and re-examine its rules, regulations and guidelines to ensure that they are still working as intended to accomplish the SECs mission. This is most recently manifested in areas such as data protection and cybersecurity, as well as the emergence of new investments and technologies such as initial coin offerings and blockchain. It is essential that the SEC approach these new challenges in a fair and transparent manner, provide clarity and certainty to the markets and investors, and enforce the laws and regulations that hold market participants accountable. Now in newly obtained [documents](URL outlining a meeting he took on October 9, we see he's been talking to the companies many believe are ""most likely"" to pull off getting approval for a Bitcoin ETF. In that meeting there were representatives from all three - CBOE, SolidX, and VanEck. &lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[](URL outlines who was in attendance at a recent meeting with the Commissioner...&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Among the topics of discussion - the reasons why their previous attempts were denied, and what ""significant changes"" have they implemented to address those issues since then. Summed up, the SEC's main concerns back then revolved around how new Bitcoin was, at least to them. In my opinion what it comes down to is regulators fear it's a market that could still surprise them, for good or for bad - and getting someone who is ultimately still part of the political system to put their signature on something related to Bitcoin, will be a challenge. Their fear of the unknown was apparent by their emphasis on it being a market still in it's ""early stages"" in their previous ruling. Having heard those concerns, on the topic of why the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust should now be approved, they argued that long gone are the days of Bitcoin markets being the 'wild west' of investing, saying ""Concerns around price manipulation have been mitigated"" and pointing out ""Cboe, bitcoin futures, OTC desks are regulated"". I'm not even going to attempt to make a prediction on what happens next. Because what's happening now is interesting enough - the new SEC Commissioner is paying attention, and evidenced by this meeting happening within his first few weeks, he's giving it priority. ------- Author: [Ross Davis](mailto:ross@globalcryptopress.com) E-Mail: [Ross@GlobalCryptoPress.com](mailto:Ross@GlobalCryptoPress.com) Twitter:[@RossFM](URL San Francisco News Desk // from Global Cryptocurrency Press - The latest in bitcoin and cryptocurrency.

Aksakov further elaborated, saying, For example, you bring 100 thousand rubles to a bank and get 100 thousand crypto rubles, one to one for fiat money. You can use these funds to buy goods fixed in the blockchain. Aksakov went on to say that a digital Russian ruble would replace the fiat ruble, as soon as blockchain begins to occupy a significant place in our economy. Last week, Aksakov discussed in a press conference that the Russian government is considering the launch of a state-backed cryptocurrency pegged 1:1 to the Russian ruble. * IBM and Seagate, a data storage company, have announced a partnership that will use blockchain technology to tackle the problem of counterfeit hard drives. Specifically, the joint initiative will leverage IBMs Blockchain Platform to allow manufactures, business partners, and integrators to authenticate the validity of hard drives. Seagate will also implement its Certified Erase solution, which, employs cryptographic erasure technology to produce a digital certificate of data purge, which is electronically signed by the device under the Seagate Secure public key infrastructure (PKI) and stored on the blockchain for compliance management with emerging global data privacy laws. * NRI SecureTechnologies, a subsidiary of Japans Nomura Research Institute (NRI), unveiled a new blockchain security alert tool in a press release while also announcing that it is partnering with US blockchain software company ConsenSys. The blockchain security alert tool, dubbed, Blockchain Security Monitoring Service, will inform operators of blockchain networks about vulnerabilities in the system.

202,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,What Makes Particls Decentralized Marketplace Stand Out From its Competition,0,9fl1q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9fl1q2/what_makes_particls_decentralized_marketplace/,2018-09-14 05:29:05,"Every once in a while, this questions pops out: &gt;What makes Particl stand out from its competition, and why is it better? I thought I'd make a quick rundown on my **opinion** on the matter! # Private-by-Design? Built With Privacy in Mind from the Ground Up! Unlike all of its competition, Particl is built from the ground up to be entirely private/anonymous, following the true crypto roots. To accomplish this difficult prowess, it uses several methods to keep its users within an optimal privacy environment, such as the RingCT and CT privacy protocols, metadata stripping, IP address anonymization through Tor (and many more protocols in the future, including [Dandelion++](URL private escrow system with no intermediate, encrypted and private messaging (using [SMSG](URL and eventually more scalable and leading-edge [DSNs](URL such as [Loopix](URL [IPFS](URL and etc), and much more. [With all the data leaks and hacks, privacy is becoming more and more mainstream](URL [(link](URL to case for privacy)](URL Furthermore, we all see that the government and big companies have developed very effective blockchain tracking software[ that makes tracking public cryptocurrency transactions quite trivial](URL Indeed, it may be just as bad in terms of privacy to use a public blockchain than say, a bank or payment processor. This is why having a product built with privacy in mind right from the start (vs patching privacy into a non-private blockchain) is extremely important. Every day, the *""if* *you have nothing to hide, you don't really need privacy""* kind of thinking is becoming obsolete as people realize just how much privacy is important even for ""good behaving"" people. Plus, there is definitely some kind of people that do require a more private environment, which theyll want to use a solution thats been designed with this as a prime aspect. ## But why does that even matter? As broken down [in an earlier article of mine](URL privacy is becoming a hot subject in the mainstream world. Gone are the days where privacy was associated to people who had things to hide. &gt;In light of the recent and now too regular cyber attacks on tech giants like [Equifax](URL [Facebook](URL [Deloitte](URL [Yahoo](URL [FedEx](URL [Uber](URL [Under Armour](URL or even [Pizza Hut](URL the poor communication and, even in some cases, cover-up of the unfortunate facts, the public confidence towards the tech industry has been severely eroded within the last couple of years.-[The Case for Privacy in the Tech Industry](URL Breaches of personal data are becoming far too common, and a good solution to fight this issue is to stop sharing your data with big companies that do not respect your private life. However, opting for blockchains instead can be just as bad, if not worse, than relying on trusting a big corporation. Why you ask? Because blockchains are usually open for all to see by default. Indeed, transactions on public blockchains are getting easier to track by the day, and for vendors and buyers alike, this isnt good. Buyers obviously dont want everyone to know what theyre buying and just how many coins they hold, information that could be obtained simply by analyzing a decentralized marketplace based on a public blockchain. Vendors, on the other hand, do not want anyone to analyze their sales data, statistics, and revenues. Particl is built as a private-by-default marketplace, meaning that users do not need to go through several steps to protect their personal data. Everything happens automatically, under the hood, and as smoothly as you would expect from a public blockchain. # Built as a 100% Decentralized &amp; Trustless Solution Another advantage is that the Particl Marketplace is designed as a 100% decentralized and trustless solution, which most of its competitors arent. Just as an example, Syscoin's Blockmarket interface is closed-source and moderated by Syscoin staff. Escrows on Syscoin are arbitrated, meaning there needs to be someone acting as escrow agent in case a deal turns sour. This can quickly lead to bias, collusion, or other similar types of issue born from the simple fact that a third-party basically has full power over the settlement of a dispute. Talking to various vendors, this quickly becomes an issue for vendors on eBay, for example, because eBay/Paypal will most of the time side with the buyer, even when it shouldnt. On Particl Marketplace, there is literally no counter-party at play. The escrow is based on smart-contract functionalities and uses the MAD game-theory to keep both parties honest, no moderator required to settle disputes. The marketplace itself will be entirely governed by the community, making sure no person or group of person is held liable for the content published on it or collude with either vendors or buyers. This is much closer, in my personal opinion, to the original, crypto-anarchist vision and reason of why Bitcoin was created in the first place. Fun fact, did you know that Satoshi Nakamoto had started working on a 100% trustless and decentralized marketplace and that there was even some code about it in some Bitcoin's repository? # Much Better &amp; Intuitive User Interface Particl has a beautiful UI/UX that is built with accessibility and ease-of-use in mind. This top of the line wallet looks modern, slick, and is very easy to understand as well as being very smooth and responsive. The same cant be said of most wallets in the crypto sphere, most of them being far too geeky or barebone to be used by mainstream, non-crypto users. Additionally, Particl plans on developing a web &amp; mobile interface at some point in the future, which they already have a good idea of how they would go about it. In order to break into the mainstream, the marketplace will need to be as easy to use as any other online eCommerce platform, therefore a web and mobile interface are absolutely required. While this isnt currently part of the roadmap, it certainly is a milestone the team plans on tackling after the mainnet release of Particl Marketplace. **Particl Marketplace Alpha:** &amp;#x200B; URL # The Coin Actually Makes Sense to Hold The Particl coin is one of many perks. While it currently still is at the mercy of speculators, it is designed to eventually decouple from the speculation and get its value organically through the demand the marketplace will generate for it. It first serves as a privacy coin, with CT already on mainnet and RingCT on testnet (currently being academically reviewed by the NJIT Dept. of Technology). Particl is indeed the first coin ever to modify RingCT, the privacy protocol made popular by Monero, so that it could be implemented on top of the Bitcoin codebase (or any codebase other than Cryptonote, for that matter). This implementation will **unlock RingCTs potential**by making it possible to be used in smart-contracts and decentralized applications as well as over the Lightning Network (that of which Particl is working on), atomic swaps and advanced multi-signatures. We all know how Monero is a great privacy coin, and Particl is actually taking it a bit further by adding utility features to this great privacy protocol (RingCT) and supporting it with a truly decentralized infrastructure. Imagine if Monero, in all its greatness, could have its own marketplace that cannot be shut down or censoredThat alone is a huge reason why Particl is a great coin to hold. It can also be used as a nice **passive income source** . Indeed, you can cold stake your PART coin using PPoS (Particl Proof-of-Stake, which has cold staking and hardware cold staking (cold staking on Ledger Nano S) enabled) and make a minimum of 4% yearly interest (that decreases over time until it stabilizes at 2% in 2 years). On top of that, stakers will earn 100% of the listing fees, as well as transaction fees, and of course, all revenue derived from the other Particl dApps. One thing that is often overlooked is how Particl is a decentralized application platform, but doesnt offer tokens. This ultimately means users looking to use Particls applications generate demand for the PART coin, even though the Particl platform is designed to accept almost any coin and (eventually) more traditional means of payments. The Particl coin is also used as ""gas"" required to run Particl smart-contracts and is used as the de facto currency in the Particl Marketplace. In fact, Particl Marketplace **does accept almost any coin** , either through the use of atomic swaps (already on mainnet since 2017) or through third-party implementations (i.e. Changelly). The catch though is that the escrow needs to use PART to keep users private (because it requires RingCT and the escrow actually is a Particl smart-contract), so even when shopping on the marketplace using Bitcoin or your favorite coin, they end up being automatically transferred into Particl with no extra step required by the user. In other words, even using other coins to purchase items off the marketplace generates demand for the PART coin. Finally, but not least, PART coins also grant users moderation powers over the Particl Marketplace as well as the ability to vote on any community proposal through the decentralized governance system. In fact, no central authority, company, or team has moderation powers over the marketplace. Particl instead delegates that power to the very community using the platform. This is a much more scalable (no need to hire staff), secure (no legal liability put on moderators), and fair (the very users of the marketplace are the one with the power to steer the ship) way to do it. # Particl is Much More Than a Decentralized Marketplace In the end, Particl is actually much more than just a marketplace, it is a full-blown privacy-focused dApp platform. Indeed, the team has put in its roadmap the release of a developer SDK toolkit which will allow any developer out there to easily build their own application on Particl. Whether it be a social media/Twitter-like application, a decentralized gambling Dapp, or even the addition of a penny auction section to Particl Marketplace, the SDK will truly allow the network to grow into much more than just a decentralized marketplace. The goal here is not to directly compete with other smart-contract platforms like Ethereum, its more about being a decentralized platform where dApps can all be interacted with directly from the wallet in order to create something akin to perhaps an operating system. Imagine the wallet (Particl Desktop) as an Android OS and each Particl dApps as Android applications. The Particl Desktop wallet is kind of like the wrapper which contains the dApps that make the Particl decentralized economy, and these applications are designed to fit right into it in a very intuitive and user-friendly fashion (in contrast to other Dapp platforms which are generally pretty barebone). One of Particl's goal is to take crypto a step further by not only decentralizing currency, but also to decentralize the entire infrastructure surrounding said currency (and that, obviously, includes the eCommerce infrastructure on which the coin can be spent). # Top-Tier Development Team The Particl development team is definitely a top-tier team. They are indeed ranked 6th in one of the most thorough code quality review ([ **URL ](URL that did review up to 200 coins (in comparison, Syscoin is currently ranked 36th, BitBay is 192nd, Safex is not even active enough to be ranked). The code quality review takes a lot of things into account, and disregards community and marketing, solely focusing on the code itself. This is something the Particl team is extremely proud of! Indeed, the Particl team was the first reach accomplish many achievements such as true cold staking, hardware cold staking (Ledger + cold staking), first blockchain to be natively implemented with Segwit, first to implement the RingCT and CT protocols on top of the Bitcoin codebase, and always the first to update it's codebase (currently on 0.16.0.2 with 0.17 ready on testnet) to the latest Bitcoin Core version (after Bitcoin itself, of course). They have had a lot of other accomplishments as well, though they were not the first to execute them. It is, overall, a very talented team that is not afraid to push the limit while never sacrificing privacy, security and decentralization. To see the incredible development work made over time, watch the Github visualization videos included in this blog post: [URL [Particl Project Development Timeline](URL # Many Decentralized Marketplaces Could and Probably Will Co-Exist As we are seeing with privacy coins right now, a lot of them are identical or almost identical, yet each of these coins has their own dedicated community. Same thing with eCommerce platforms. We have Amazon, Alibaba, eBay, Etsy, and etcall co-existing and making profits within their own community or niche. I think we'll see the same happen with decentralized marketplaces. Wise vendors won't limit their business to one platform, as that would end up limiting their potential customer base. Instead, I see many decentralized marketplaces all co-existing and all sharing a share of the decentralized marketplace industry. This is not a winner take all kind of scenario, as long as a marketplace can offer good features, good UI/UX, low or no fees, and of course, products for sale AND customers, these platforms stand a chance to survive even though they are not alone in this space. What I do find very interesting in Particl compared to other decentralized marketplaces is how its native coin is designed to be scarce and in high demand. As such, even a small volume of marketplace transactions could increase the value of Particl considerably. That is because: * Users will generate demand for the coin when making purchases (even if they use another coin) * More coins get locked up for a certain period of time in escrow. In reality, **up to three times the value of an item can end up locked up in escrow** as the buyer needs to pay for the item + make a security deposit while the vendor also has to put a security deposit. Escrow lockups can last from minutes, to hours to days and weeks, depending on the specific context and use-case. * A great portion of the coins are locked up in staking (can be transferred out at any time, but while they are staking they are effectively out of circulation) as the passive income gained from the process becomes very interesting when the marketplace gets transactions volume since stakers get 100% of the listings fees and other Dapp revenues. Currently, around 36.6% of the entire supply is out of circulation and being staked. Many in the community expects this amount to increase as the marketplace gets traction. Note that there is no minimum amount of PART required for staking, thus anyone can stake and receive rewards. That is even more true with the coming staking pool currently under development that will allow even the smallest of holders to stake their funds and receive smaller but more recurrent rewards. * Users are not forced to use PART, they can use their favorite cryptocurrency. Ultimately, non-PART transactions are still settled in PART in the background, generating demand for the coin. Particl indeed aims at attracting other communities to its platform and offer a use-case to any coin. It doesnt mean its native coin PART cannot be positively impacted from this! The four points above are why I believe that, even though many decentralized marketplaces will most probably end up all splitting shares of the same pie, even a low volume of transactions on Particl would probably end up naturally increase the price of the coin. No speculation needed when it takes off! This is one of the biggest reason I got into Particl instead of its competitors (their coins dont have such good economics, not that I know of at least). # Third-Party Building on the Particl Protocol (Mubiz) Another big thing about Particl too is that Mubiz, a decentralized marketplace aggregator and web gateway, is actually working on implementing the marketplace. What this means is that Mubiz will render the marketplace available on the web only a few days after its initial release and will offer its customers a whole array of services not readily available on Particl Desktop. These services include escrow management on behalf of the user (readno need to deal with the escrow, all in the background and the user experience is no different than eBay), customer support &amp; product returns, shipping management (vendors can ship their products to Mubiz), traditional means of payments (credit/banking cards, eventually Paypal and other fiat payment methods), reviews, SEO for listings, and etc. Mubiz currently only operates with OpenBazaar, and Particl will be the second marketplace theyll be hosting on their platform. They mentioned in an interview I conducted with Albin, Mubizs Founder, that they had identified issues with OpenBazaar (since its the first decentralized marketplace ever, it does have flaws that can be improved upon) that were not present or that were fixed with Particl, hence why theyve decided to integrate the marketplace into its platform. Mubiz is, in my opinion, going to provide a crucial set of services that will make Particl as easy to use as eBay or Amazon. The only difference? Vendors will be making more money (they will make 100% of the sales proceeds), in turn allowing them to lower their prices to score more sales and outplay their competitors. The end result is more profits for the vendor, more sales, and cheaper prices for the customer. Surely this should be an attractive solution for most? Whats **your** biggest reason why you think Particl stands out from its competitor? I most probably forgot some stuff in there, so curious to see what you all think!"

The newest research from cybersecurity analysts reportedly reveals that widely trusted government websites  including those of the director of the municipal administration of Andhra Pradesh, Tirupati Municipal Corporation and Macherla municipality  have become the latest to be exploited by the practice. Have to remember that cryptojacking is the practice of infecting a target with malware that uses a computers processing power to mine for cryptocurrencies without the owners consent or knowledge.

207,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,AM Crypto News Recap: Cryptocurrencies are mixed after yesterdays rally as Chinese search engine giant Baidu publishes white paper detailing a Super Chain,1,9jd0dk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9jd0dk/am_crypto_news_recap_cryptocurrencies_are_mixed/,2018-09-27 23:46:40," ### Crypto News * A Swiss-based startup headed by former UBS bankers, SEBA Crypto AG, has raised 100 million Swiss Francs (USD$103 million) to build a bank that offers crypto related services. SEBA Crypto AG plans to apply for a banking and security dealer license through Switzerlands financial market regulator, FINMA. This license would allow SEBA Crypto AG to partake in crypto trading and investing on behalf of other banks and qualified investors. * A US federal district judge ruled that an alleged fraudulent cryptocurrency scam can be classified as a commodity and falls under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The CFTC sued alleged fraudulent coin, My Big Coin Pay, after the individuals behind the coin misled investors by releasing a series of false statements. The coin raised roughly USD$6 million from investors while claiming the coin was backed by gold. * According to two US financial experts, North Korea is utilizing cryptocurrencies in order to evade US sanctions. Lourdes Miranda, a financial crimes investigator, and Ross Delston, an expert in anti-money laundering and combatting financing of terrorism, believe that North Korea is making its own cryptocurrency while also using popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Earlier this year, former NSA cybersecurity official, Priscilla Moriuchi, said that North Korea is likely earning between USD$15 million and USD$200 million per year by mining and selling cryptocurrencies. * Australias Taxation Office has warned citizens of scammers impersonating tax officials and demanding tax debs be paid in cryptocurrencies. Scammers have called Australian citizens and threatened that if tax debts were not cleared urgently, the federal police would place them under arrest. * Chinese search engine and web services company, Baidu, has released the, Baidu Blockchain White Paper V1.0 that describes a, Super Chain network system. Released Wednesday, the paper lays out the idea of developing a blockchain-as-a-service platform that would house six of Baidus current applications, including Totem, Degree Universe, Baidu Association, Treasure Chest, Encyclopedia Online, and Hubert. Baidus white paper claims that the, Super Chain is more efficient than a traditional blockchain and has an ability to perform with a higher degree of hardware utilization. * Marsh, a global professional services firm, announced Wednesday that it would be working with IBM Blockchain to expand its efforts to offer insurance solutions. Marsh will be launching a commercial version of its insurance verification program on IBM Blockchain in order to streamline the insurance certification process, adding speed and transparency for clients seeking to hire contractors. * State-owned Chinese bank, Bank of Communications, completed a massive 9.3 billion yuan (USD$1.3 billion) residential mortage backed security issuance using a blockchain network. In order to complete this issuance, Bank of Communications used its Jucai Chain blockchain network, which was first rolled out in June for asset-backed security issuances. Veem, a blockchain payments startup, has closed its USD$25 million fund round that was led by Goldman Sachs. Veem also received funding from other notables, including GV (formerly Google Ventures), Silicon Valley Bank, and Pantera Capital. Veem aims to offer a payments platform that includes both traditional SWIFT-based transfers and blockchain networks. * West Virginians have begun using a blockchain-based mobile app to cast absentee ballots in the upcoming midterm election, according to a report by Slate. Voatz allows citizens of West Virginia that are overseas and registered in one of 24 countries to cast absentee ballots via smartphones. Pilot testing for Voatz started in March of this year and was successfully completed in May after passing four audits assessing security of various components. **Sources:** r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Abras Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Token (Bit10) will track the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization and rebalance monthly. Abra stressed that the new token is not a fund. Instead, the token utilizes smart contracts to peg an investors cryptocurrency or fiat holdings to Bit10. * Gemini, the cryptocurrency exchange headed by the Winklevoss twins, has obtained insurance coverage for the digital asset holdings under Geminis custody. In a press release Wednesday, the firm detailed that insurance coverage is being provided by global professional services firm, Aon. Gemini also maintains Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations (FDIC) insurance for dollar deposits held by the exchange. * IBM has been awarded a patent by the US Patent and Trademark Office for a blockchain-based secure system. IBM first filed for this patent in September 2017. The patent details blockchain technology that can detect security breaches within a network by connecting monitors to a chain configuration. In late September, IBM was awarded a patent for the autonomous self-servicing of networked devices that would form an Autonomous Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Telemetry environment. * In a press release Wednesday morning, TD Ameritrade announced they are backing new cryptocurrency exchange, ErisX. ErisX has plans to reveal their full business plan later today, although a report by Bloomberg details ErisX will begin selling cyptocurrency futures contracts in early 2019 while also offering services for investors to trade BItcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. TD Ameritrade currently provides retail investment services to almost 11 million clients. According to Bloomberg, high-speed trading house Virtu Financial and investing company DRW holdings are also participating in the investment into ErisX. * JP Morgans recent efforts to expand blockchain technology operations is part of a larger digital technology roadmap, according to a press release published by ResearchAndMarkets.com. The press release details that blockchain technology is on the top priority of JP Morgan, while other technologies being pursued by the bank include big data, cloud operations, artificial intelligence, and robotics. JP Morgan reportedly has set aside USD$10.8 billion for technology spending in 2018, USD$5 billion of which is set to go towards fintech investments. * The Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense has sent a questionnaire to cryptocurrency exchanges whose bank accounts were closed by major Brazilian banks. The Brazilian antitrust regulator sent questionnaires to 10 cryptocurrency exchanges, including Bitcoin Market, Bitambio, BitcoinTrade, and Brazilex. This move by the Brazilian regulator comes shortly after launching a probe into six major Brazilian banks for the alleged unlawful closing of cryptocurrency exchanges bank accounts. * The Israel Securities Authority has begun to implement blockchain technology into its messaging system, according to an article by the Times of Israel. The purpose of the blockchain implementation is to improve the regulators cybersecurity. The Israel Securities Authority reportedly has plans to implement blockchain technology into an online voting system as well as an information database in the near future. **Sources:** r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL "

The report also cites several growth drivers for blockchain in the manufacturing sector, including the growth of blockchain-as-a-service solutions and recent increases of venture capital investment in blockchain. * According to Matthew Allen, the Assistant Director of Domestic Operations with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) Homeland Security Investigation division, a vulnerability is created when criminals convert cryptocurrency to government-issued fiat currency. While discussing the role of cryptocurrencies in drug trafficking before the US Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Allen detailed that when cryptocurrencies are converted to fiat currencies, criminals can be identified and tracked by law enforcement. Allen went on to note that his Homeland Security Investigation division has had some levels of success in tracking criminals who used cryptocurrencies to launder funds from narcotic sales. * Acing, a cryptocurrency startup working specifically on the lightning network, has received USD$1.7 million in a funding round led by Serena Capital. Acing works on improving the lightning network, a network layer that sits on top of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and enable higher transaction volume capabilities. The lightning network entered beta testing earlier this year with individuals using it to send real money, however, the technology is far from complete. Currently, 113.12 BTC are tied up in the lightning network, or USD$741,818.86. * Head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Christine Lagarde, believes global markets are on the verge of another financial crash. Lagarde detailed that global debt in both the public and private sectors have reached an all-time high of USD$182 trillion -- a 60% increase since the Great Recession in 2008. While speaking at the IMFs annual meeting, Lagarde said, large challenges loom for the global economy to prevent a second Great Depression. Lagarde went on to detail that rapid technologic advances in financial technology pose increased cybersecurity risks, leaving global markets further vulnerable. * Long-time crypto bull and founder of merchant bank Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, said while speaking on stage at the Economist Finance Disrupted event in Manhattan that he does not believe Bitcoins price will crack USD$9,000 before the end of 2018. This represent a trip in Novogratzs price forecast for Bitcoin after he predicted during last years bull run that Bitcoins price would surpass USD$40,000 in 2018. * Poloniex, a US-based cryptocurrency exchange, announced Wednesday of plans to remove margin and lending products and to delist three digital assets for US customers. In the announcement, Poloniex explained that this move affecting US-based customers is an effort to ensure the crypto exchange remains within regulatory guidelines. Poloniex plans to delist the three cryptocurrencies on October 10th, and they include Synereo (AMP), Expanse (EXP), and Gnosis (GNO). Poloniex is currently the 46th ranked crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. * The price of Tether (USDT), the most widely used stablecoin, fell by \~1% yesterday and resulted in a premium on USDT-to-cryptocurrency trades. Tether is the cryptocurrency markets largest stablecoin and is backed by USD$2.8 billion stored in a Tether LLC bank account in Puerto Rico. One reason for USDTs price drop yesterday is a large selloff of USDT by investors, potentially to invest in other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. * US Congress members, Doris Matsui and Brett Guthrie, have introduced a bill to the US House of Representatives, titled the, Blockchain Promotional Act 2018. In an announcement Monday, Representative Matsui detailed that currently, there are several different definitions for blockchain technology depending on the situation. The Blockchain Promotional Act 2018 bill proposes the creation of a working group in the US Department of Commerce to form a standardized definition of blockchain. * US investors and Japans Mizuho Bank have requested a delay in the lawsuit accusing Mt. Gox of creating transaction difficulties for users as Mt. Gox was in the midst of a collapse. The purpose of the delay request is to allow the plaintiffs time to understand if they will be fully or partially compensated for losses related to the collapse of Mt. Gox. This delay comes as Mt. Gox trustee, Nobuaki Kobayashi, revealed that USD$617 million was raised through the sale of Bitcoin that were recovered from the collapse -- a sum that is believed to be adequate to pay claims in full and not partially as previously thought. **Sources:** r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL r/URL"

Fortnite - one of the most popular games in the world now - gamers got scammed. Scammers using malware that targets the Bitcoin (BTC) wallet addresses, as Cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes said. How did it happen? So, thieves are sneaking malicious data theft code into downloads that apparently promise free season six Fortnite Android versions, among other bogus cheats, wallhacks and aimbots. So-called free V-Bucks  an in-game currency that can be used to purchase additional gaming content  also conceal malicious packages of code. The download links were shared via scammers youtube channels. Interesting? Next more! As investigation said, more than 1,200 downloads had already been completed. A file named Trojan.Malpack, was a data stealer targeting Bitcoin wallets. The file in question reportedly attempted to redirect the siphoned information via a POST command to an /index.php file in the Russian Federation, courtesy of the IP address The crypt mining malware (cryptojacking  among hackers) is continuously rising. source: cointelegraph "
214,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Quant [QNT] October 8 AMA,1,9mj72j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/9mj72j/quant_qnt_october_8_ama/,2018-10-09 08:50:17,"I've taken the liberty of compiling the questions and answers from today's AMA. Enjoy reading! &amp;#x200B; Q: Was there any reason why the team chose to create a decentralized Amazon to show off the progress with connectors? It caused big interest. Thanks. A: You know, I only expected a ""hello world"" MApp from the team to show cross-chain interoperability. They blew me away and created a truely decentralised Amazon that operates across 3 blockchains. Very proud! &amp;#x200B; Q: Does qnt offer any additional security against ddos viruses, mallware or any other cyber/hacking threats? A: Yes, this is built in, coming from our Cybersecurity background. We're creating new Security infastructure in the space of Identity, Firewall, DPI and IPS that sits on top of Overledger, giving additional security controls to use blockchains which doesn't exist today. &amp;#x200B; Q: What exactly is the patent about and what does this imply (if granted) for other blockchain interoperability projects like aion, wan and icx? A: The Patent was filed on 1st December as an EU Patent. It covers how we're doing ordering and filtering to protect the inner core of Overledger. It should be granted around the end of 2019. It just means other projects can not use our method and approach to have interoperabilty. &amp;#x200B; Q: Question from my side, Recently this twitter account released a press release of a partner ship with Quant Network. Could you elaborate on that ? [URL A: We're building a new upstream Power Exchange. Allowing for closed P2P Power networks (like powerledger) to cross-exchange on a new Power Exchange with all the other P2P Power networks. &amp;#x200B; Q: Does the team have an update on the Zapier integration concept? Might we see Overledger working with 1000s of Apps one day via Zapier? A: This is exciting for us. We're integrating Overledger with Zapier. This will allow us to bridge the thousands of internet applications to blockchain, through Overledger. Huge potential! \-Followup Q: Wow this is Massive! So Enterprises will be able to connect the data from their Apps (Excel, CRMs, ERPs) into Overledger - as well as cross connect blockchains? Correct? A: Yes exactly. It's a leap into our 3rd phase of our strategy to connect the internet to blockchain. We can do this today rather than waiting 2-3 years! Every single Internet application can integrate with blockchain through Overledger. Quite groundbreaking &amp;#x200B; Q: Have you looked at connecting machine learning + AI blockchain consensus' like neurochain for increased diversity of overledger A: Yes we're big fans of AI and have mentioned quite a few projects. We're in the final stages of announcing a partnership or JV with AI Nexus to create decentralised intelligence. &amp;#x200B; Q: Your post regarding the decentralized Amazon where you show a pic of XRP, ETH and BTC payments is pretty awesome, although why couldnt you show the community some better proof like at least a video and even better - some proof on the blockchains? A: We will be sharing some live demos over the next few weeks and a more detailed one during our Nov 20 Quant X event for developers. As Gilbert, mentioned, the MApp that the team shared blew us away and we wanted to share it real time. We will also be sharing demos for devs/chief architects etc on the Quant Dev Portal. &amp;#x200B; Q: Latoken listing was a mistake, there is zero activity on it. Would you consider this a fail? A: Then you can use IDEX? Don't know what everyone wants, we've just started to list on exchanges, another 2-3 in the works. If you're not happy, sorry. We're not going to do everything for everyone. We have a set focus and vision to achieve. &amp;#x200B; Q: How many devs are currently working on the project and are you planning on expanding your team? I have seen only 5 people contributing on the Github and not sure if they have some real previous blockchain experience (Im not exactly a programmer myself so perhaps I missed something) A: We have done profiles of our team and their experiene with DLT on Medium as well as on our website - all quite experieced as you can see from their outputs. Rui and Alex's profile on Medium to be posted over the next two weeks. \-Followup Q: I know, but perhaps the team needs to be a little bigger, not sure if 5 devs are enough for this. But afterall, maybe it is if the companies will use the SDK themselves A: Thanks for the suggestion, but we're a good size and have the right capable and experienced team. Adding another 20 people to the team now isn't going to achieve anything. &amp;#x200B; Q: Where is the software hosted? i.e. my desktop computer's OS is on its hard drive, so where is the Overledger? Is it cloud-based like AWS/Azure, and if so who hosts the servers and where? A: Good questions. It comes down to the developers. You can create MApps as a Webapp or Cloud, on an OS (Win/OSX/Linux) or Mobile (iOS/Android). &amp;#x200B; Q: Besides GoVerify Mapp, are there any other Mapps being developed by Quant that are interesting for financial institutions? A: Yes, we have a few. A Cross-Trade Finance MApp to allow multiple supply chains using different systems and blockchains to talk to each other. Also are creating a cross-blockchain AML Compliance tool for Regulators and Financial Institutions. One thing to note here on this one - we are also building our MApps to utilize the QNT token. That is the beauty of having multi-purpose utility token versus a security token because you can add mutliple functions. We will reveal more over the coming months as we finalize the tech (somethings are senstive or competitive intelligence that we can't share) but this is something worth noting now because it doesn't begin and end with just the fee structures for Overledger. &amp;#x200B; Q: Whats the next connector after quorum? Was the quorum one mentioned before, any reason for that connector? A: We want to work on the technology that our clients use the most. &amp;#x200B; Q: Does quant have control over APIs or can developers design their own because platform risk might be a concern. A: Yes of course we control the APIs. We call them BPI (Blockchain Programming Interface). &amp;#x200B; Q: Token function - So assuming that the token is somewhat like a license for using the service, how much tokens would a company need in order to make for instance 1000 transactions from XRP to ETH per day? Would they need just 1 token or would it be scaled according to the usage somehow? A: That's what we're working out currently, now that the SDK is out. We have team of internal and external technical, lawyers and economists on this. It's a new model that really hasn't been done before. What we know is that we will have a flexible pricing approach for MApps for developers to set the price/usage regarding tokens and volume. &amp;#x200B; Q: any idea when the US Bank/financial institution will be announced in october? A: still in the works, we'll announce when we can. &amp;#x200B; Q: what do you hope to achieve from the QauntX event on Nov 20th? 2. Also, will you be capturing all the juicy content (photos, video, audio) for posting/sharing? Great opportunity for videos and images for marketing etc. A: Absolutely will have it all captured on video as well as plenty of photos. The event is targeted predominantly to devs/architects and CIOs and to so we can provide live demos of the technology and show what is possible/answer questions. We also expect to use this as an opportunity to invite some of our clients so they can betterunderstand the tech and what is possible. &amp;#x200B; Q: In layman's terms where does QNT sit in the technology stack It's not it's own chain so how does it interact with chains , it's an operating system but where does it operate?"" - Is there a quick way to help tech newbies understand how Overledger operates? A: Think of it as running distributed across Cloud providers and then blockchains to provide the API gateways to blockchains. &amp;#x200B; Q: Is there a plan to actually market quant in the future as a license to take advantage of an ecosystem during the campaign A: We're working on our marketing approach which is more directed to Enterprises. We're covering all the channels to use the best possible segment and reach. Here's some of areas we're looking into. From the release of the SDK, we've ramped this up and you'll be seeing a lot more on Quant, especially if you work in corporates: Targeting Blogs Publicity Unconventional PR Search Engine Marketing (SEM) Social and Display Ads Offline Ads Search Engine Optimization (SEO) Content Marketing Email Marketing Viral Marketing Engineering as Marketing Business Development (BD) Sales Affiliate Programs Existing Platforms Trade Shows Offline Events Speaking Engagements Community Building &amp;#x200B; Q: Not really a question, but it'd be cool if you discuss the possibility of joining SAP partner edge, so many applications that quant can provide to those members. Ofc it's already cool that you're already in talks with a US bank A: Thank you for the suggest. We can integrate easily to SAP or other ERP systems. We'll start looking in to it &amp;#x200B; Q: Can you also consider a Connect IT with Quant icon - bit like Intel Inside. This signifies that the app, MApp or blockchain can be connected via Quant (Overledger) etc. the icon can also be a link to the official integration page - hosted on your site - indicating its an official product/partner. The IT part is a play on words that IT folks will get. A: Thank you Robin, like it! We've been playing around ""Powered by Overledger"" something like the ""Intel Inside"" tag line. Will come out with something catchy and effective &amp;#x200B; Q: Can overledger implement/integrate a privacy layer using something like TEE/MPC to protect sensitive/confidential data? A: We already have that with TrustTag. It allows you to set privacy fields to tokenise data you don't want others to see &amp;#x200B; Q: A community member posted an article with a strong interopability focus: [URL Perhaps you guys could take a look and use it as an oppurtunity to gain some traction/awareness? A: Thanks Luke. We've already connected Hyperledger and Ethereum to Overledger. We know the EEA/IBM teams and can discuss in more detail. &amp;#x200B; Q: will the team be releasing a blockchain that can be used as a test and/or starter blockchain for Enterprises. Obviously it can be connected to others via Overledger later - but I see two Enterprise use cases: 1. Test bed easily scratched and reset; 2. Simple ledger for immutable storage - especially when Zapier allows Excel data to flow. A: That's exactly the use case the new blockchain will solve. An appropriate enterprise-geared blockchain that provides better distributed storage for large amounts of data. It's a gap in the market the current generation of blockchains are solving or are not fit for purpose. One problem we have is we can't agree what to name it. Love to hear some suggestions &amp;#x200B; Q: Did you speak to any interested enterprises during the london fraud conference about GoVerify? A: Yes, quite a few including Government. Following up with them this week. &amp;#x200B; Q: Is Dr John Lambert still an advisor for Quant Health? I noticed he recently moved to DXC and was wondering if this impacts his advisory role? A: Yes he's still an advisor. We're looking to work closer with DXC on a couple of engagements in the UK and in Australia. &amp;#x200B; Q: Have you considered doing interviews with youtube crypto influencers/shillers. (paraphrased) A: from my perspective we like to speak with credible influencers in the crypto space who don't operate under a 'cash for comments' fee structure which is why we are big fans of Brad. Some of the practices in the crypto space are not 'necessary evils' but highly unethical. Even the ones who claim 'never accept money for interviews' operate under undisclosed 'advisory' roles where they ask for extortianate rates in tokens. Also, over the last 10months Gilbert and Quant have been featured in New York Times, New Scientist Magazine, Politico, USNews, and even had an op ed published on Fox (which wasn't our target but it has massive reach so it doesn't hurt) plus behind the scenes he has done an amazing job of doing 1:1 briefings with the most senior staff members from Washington Post, CNN, msnbc, bloomberg and even did an interview for Al Gore's Climate Change Newsletter etc. i don't know if you all appreciate, how significant this is because most established companies take years to set up relationships and get in front of these types of reporters and they all know Gilbert now and if they want to write articles blockchain and need quotes and backgrounder info exactly they come to us. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for reading!

On 15 August 2018, Westarctica, Inc. became the first non-profit corporation to create its own cryptocurrency, known as WestarcticaCoin, based on Ethereum ERC20 tokens. WestarcticaCoin is similar to Bitcoin or Ethereum, but with some very big differences: * It is not a financial investment * It is not backed by any commodity or financial security * It is earned through ecologically-friendly actions that contribute to saving the planet WestarcticaCoin is intended to be a fun way for supporters of Westarctica to interact with one another and give or receive recognition. They are being utilized as digital brownie points, which can be acquired by taking positive actions on behalf of the environment. This new cryptocurrency will broaden the sense of community and social responsibility among Westarctica's supporters, while also harnessing a powerful new technology that will encourage everyone involved to be nicer to each other and to the planet. A total of 17.286 trillion WestarcticaCoins have been created. This amount represents the total number of square feet in Western Antarctica. An initial air drop consisting of 826 million WestarcticaCoins was distributed to the 75 people who have made significant contributions to Westarctica since it was founded in 2001. Additionally, 450,000 WestarcticaCoins have already been earned by people for their positive actions to save the planet. You can learn more about WestarcticaCoin and our philosophy on cryptocurrency ethics by visiting: URL **About Westarctica** Westarctica was founded on 2 November 2001 as a new country project with the aim of acquiring sovereignty for Western Antarctica.

231,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,AsicBoost and the strange case of CVE-2017-9230,5,8lxag7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8lxag7/asicboost_and_the_strange_case_of_cve20179230/,2018-05-25 09:41:47,"# About CVEs In the public interest of tracking and remedying cybersecurity vulnerabilities quickly, a public database was created in 2000: the CVE List [1]. CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. Its database records, known as CVEs, track and record publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each recorded vulnerability has a unique ID and lifecycle where it follows certain states. # The AsicBoost controversy In April 2017, Greg Maxwell published an email [2] on the bitcoin-dev mailing list which described AsicBoost - a patented optimization to the algorithm used in Bitcoin mining - as an attack on the Bitcoin protocol. There was much contention [3] about whether AsicBoost constituted some kind of harmful exploit, or whether it was merely a technological innovation which enabled more efficient mining hardware (ASICs). There were allegations, widely reported in media, that the patent served the interest of Bitmain [4]. The purported benefits of exploiting this patent as alleged by Core developers were contemporaneously disputed by other miners [5]. # CVE-2017-9230 raised against AsicBoost On 18 May 2017, Cameron Garnham posted to the bitcoin-dev list [6], urging for getting a CVE assigned to the perceived vulnerability. On 24 May 2017, this CVE was created as CVE-2017-9230 [7]. It was simultaneously published under Bugtraq ID 'BID 98657' at [8]. The justification in the CVE stated that the AsicBoost method &gt; 'violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside &gt; of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should &gt; not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work &gt; function execution should be independent.' It seemed a plausible enough reasoning for the CVE to be assigned. It was entered in the list of Bitcoin-related CVE's at [9]. Detailed information on this particular CVE is still missing/incomplete on the wiki page, a year after the CVE was raised. # What happened since the CVE was raised If you've followed along, you've learned that the CVE was raised to counter the exploitation of the AsicBoost method by miners. Since then, however, a Core developer, BtcDrak, has been involved in the founding of a mining company, Halong Mining. Several online sources state his (part?) ownership of this company. BtcDrak has put forward a proposal [10] which would enable the use of AsicBoost within the Bitcoin Core software (the dominant client software on the BTC network). This proposal appears to directly contradict the CVE claims of how AsicBoost violates ""security assumptions"" of Bitcoin, and indeed does not address how it mitigates them, nor is CVE-2017-9230 referenced in any of its related documentation. While the proposal's specification [11] and implementation [12] have not yet been formally accepted, the situation is that Halong has shipped mining equipment which is now actively employing AsicBoost [13,14] on the Bitcoin (BTC) network. There is even a website showing the blocks where AsicBoost was used [15]. # Conflict of interest There a clear conflict of interest in the actions of the Core developer BtcDrak. His actions as a Core developer appear to be furthering his company's interests and competitive advantage in the mining industry by exploiting a vulnerability of which he must have been keenly aware, having participated on the same bitcoin-dev mailing list where it was discussed. The CVE was vociferously used to paint Bitmain as culpable for delaying Segwit (Bitmain was accused of using AsicBoost and blocking Segwit activation for their own profit motive - claims that Bitmain has publicly denied strongly and which were never substantiated). One might have expected a similar outcry against Halong's *proven* and *announced* use of AsicBoost, but the parties that had previously condemned Bitmain remained mostly silent. Only an anonymous non-developer, Cobra-Bitcoin, co-owner of the bitcoin.org domain, spoke out on the Github pull request in [11], and Core developer Luke-jr spoke out against the use of the proposal on the Bitcoin network while consensus had not been reached on it [16]. Subsequent discussion on the bitcoin-dev list on this topic since March has been minimal and only concerned with technicalities of stratum protocol changes. # The bigger elephant in the room It seems logical that either AsicBoost constitutes an exploitable weakness, and thus merits a CVE and measures taken to prevent its use on the Bitcoin network entirely. Or it is not a problem and the CVE should be invalidated. The Bitcoin Core project should use its consensus processes to arrive at a coherent decision. # Other problems raised by the use of overt AsicBoost The Halong implementation uses version rolling of the `nversion` bits of the header. It reserves a subset of those bits for overt AsicBoost. These bits are no longer available to BIP9, but there was no update of BIP9 proposed to address this impact. This is a question of sensible procedures being followed (or not). The author did not find any review comment mentioning the lack of BIP9 specification update, which suggest a lack of thorough review on a proposal which dates back several months. A minor issue is that the Core implementation warns when a certain proportion of unrecognized version bits are detected. This behavior can be triggered by the AsicBoost method used on the network. --- [1] URL [2] URL [3] URL [4] URL [5] URL [6] URL [7] URL [8] URL [9] URL [10] URL [11] URL [12] URL [13] URL [14] URL [15] URL [16] URL --- EDITS: 1. make dates unambiguous, make it clear that [5] disputes the benefits alleged by Core developers"

The failure rate has also risen significantly with it. A lot of new retail investors gets scammed or bear huge losses due to lack of knowledge in which ICOs to participate in.I would like to bring in notice 3 ICOs currently that I think have the highest success rate. Also guys, do let me know your inputs on these ICOS or if you have any other ICO you think which also have high success rate Paymon Paymon suggests its own view of standard Blockchain, introducing ways of dealing with most issues of existing cryptocurrencies: the scaling problem, archaic architecture, low speed, and high transaction fees. Our new blockchain Hive improves all cryptocurrency instruments: from technology and infrastructure to regulatory compliance with current regulations. Business platform Profit, developed under our project, will be a universal solution for everyone: from developers and basic users to commercial organizations and ICO projects. Moreover, the project is a great investment opportunity in virtue of its tokens. Our team has currently created a blockchain messenger, which allows its users to safely and easily send each other not only messages, but also cryptocurrency. WankCoin WANKCOIN is a digital currency for purchasing adult items and services in situations where other payment options are either not available, or not ideal for you. WANKCOIN takes away the fear of your data being stolen, your identity being sold, or your credit card being charged without your authorization. It is one of the safest ICOs in the market right now as it is a proven concept. Wankcoin was first built on the same algorithm that bitcoin uses (SHA-256). Wankcoin has converted from a SHA-256 coin to an ERC20 token and is now doing crowdsale. It has been part of the market as a SHA-256 coin since 2014 so it is a great opportunity here. MonsterBit MonsterBits product is very promising. It is another clone of CryptoKitties but with strong add ons. MonsterBit is catching everyones interest as it has some exciting add ons that I suppose every one in the crypto community would like to have their hands on. The monsters in the game unlike in cryptokitties, can be evolved and every monster with different age can be sold. The criteria for evolving the monsters is to win battles for food, weapons or monsters. Food will help monsters to get evolved, the won weapons can be sold in shop, and the monsters can be trained or sold too. It doesnt end here, our monsters will also be able to advertise products for real money. MonsterBit is doing much more interesting things other than these like stuffed toy store for monsters, and the owners of monsters will get certain percentage. MonsterBit is coming up with unique and promising module in this industry and I am really excited to play. As I am a gaming enthusiast, and a blockchain believer too, this one is one of my favorite ICO to invest in. Carboneum Carboneum is building a democratised social trading platform. They intend to serve a basic functionality for copy follower &amp; leader on their own trading platform called StockRadars.. Basically building the open infrastructure for investment knowledge sharing with impressive incentive model. Above all, StockRadars is the only exclusive partner of a renowned app. LINE Thailand, the provider of a market-leading chat application, in developing a service called LINE FINANCE and together they have accumulated a large and still-growing user base of 4.8 million people. Heroic HEROIC Arc Reactor is an open, decentralized cybersecurity threat intelligence exchange powered by the blockchain. Arc Reactors purpose is to provide an open repository of cyber threat intelligence, simple programmatic access to the data, and an efficient marketplace for the data. Heroic is opening new opportunities in the blockchain industry. I have gone through their whitepaper, it has lot of technical details and is very promising.

234,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Uncloak: The Cybersecurity on the Blockchain,16,8q6th7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8q6th7/uncloak_the_cybersecurity_on_the_blockchain/,2018-06-11 14:45:37,"Most decentralized platforms pride themselves in the apparent security of the blockchains and their impervious nature to hacking. However, they do not give the same assurances to the exchanges and the clients that work with the blockchains, due to the centralized nature of these systems. sav.png Is it possible to provide blockchain based solutions to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities on computer systems? While many virus detection systems exist, there is little or no effort at all to use artificial intelligence and blockchains to provide a holistic security net for corporations. Uncloak is the exception, and we need to dissect just how they are going about this. **How IoT increases internet vulnerabilities** Are our computers secure? In fact, what are our computers now, and in the future? To understand how essential the security of our systems in the future is, we need to understand several things. The world is becoming one gigantic computer. This is being achieved by the power of the internet combined with the advanced capability to connect almost anything to the internet. Add decentralized systems to that too. We now have the emergence of smart cities, smart homes, etc. it is now possible for a car to tell a gate that it has arrived, and for the entrance to automatically open, only for the designated car. Beds are telling electric kettles, toasters and microwaves to start with the breakfast now that you are awake, and autonomous cars automatically leave the garage and park outside once you lock the front door to go to work. What can happen if all your devices are hacked? What if your car was driven off the road to a cliff by a cyber-criminal? Are there clear safeguards out there? **The Current Situation** The main problems with security currently in the cyber world are not viruses. They are hacking and ransomware. Most people believe that with updated anti-virus software, enough firewalls and proper intrusion detection software, they are safe from internet-based attacks. But hackers are crafty people. They have the same software, and they understand the architecture of threat identification and elimination. So they run rings around security providers and stay miles ahead in the new technology ridden field, costing the world trillions of shillings in data leaks, lost revenues and mitigation costs. And it is not only money that can be lost. Reputations are at stake too. Hackers have been known to infiltrate devices, acquire private photos or messages and propagate them where most damage will be caused. The damage can either be immediate or slow burn' due to customer drain and loss of personal or corporate image. **The Uncloak Solution** **Vulnerability Scanning** Uncloak will come with the ability to enable clients allow the system to automatically identify their internet footprint, including websites, devices, databases and any other internet data facilities. They will then scan the customer landscape for any threat that has been identified and mapped onto the blockchain, and where they are found, the community of white hat hackers, IT expertsand engineers will work with the client to identify the best remedial actions to take. This is vulnerability identification and not attack remediation. It allows the system actually to avert future attacks. **The Bug Bounty Element** Uncloak will operate with a blockchain-unique token called UCC, which shall be availed to users of the platform. The experts will perform an essential role in threat identification. Through assessing the clients systems and devices, the hunters will identify threats and broadcast them for validation. If validators confirm that there are no copies of the same threats on the blockchain, then the hunters will collect 10,000 UCC while the validators will each pocket 1,500 UCC. The UCC can be converted to tradable UNC tokens which can be sold for Eth on public exchanges. The hunters will also be motivated to identify remedies to deal with imminent attacks. **AI-based Threat detection engine** Now, this is where things get interesting. There is the internet we know, and then there are the black hat' abodes where evil lurks. It is known as the dark web, and this is where the trade between those who know of various system vulnerabilities and those who need it happen. In exchange for the untraceable cryptocurrency. What Uncloak will do is institute a listening system backed by their interaction with Krzana to build threat landscape reports and use them to occasion customer remedies. Once threats have been identified, clients will be notified to initiate measures to prevent attacks. **The Uncloak Roadmap** With the test MVP (Minimum Viable Product) already released and the token sale underway, the platform is now in the later stages of the documented roadmap. The main milestones that remain include their collaboration with Krzana and the launch of the community and strategic relationships. **Final Thoughts** So many technologies, devices and indeed, whole companies are now dependent on the internet and the ever increasing connectivity of devices. The security of systems and data used to control these devices is of utmost importance to protect both resources and reputations of their owners. Cybersecurity is not only achieved through the use of proper antivirus software but the capability of avoidance of hacking and such vices as ransomware. Uncloak has identified distinct technologies to achieve this. Through their vulnerability scanning, bug bounty and threat detection, they are capable of listening to the dark web and alerting clients who have vulnerabilities before attacks can happen. Their tech is unique in the sense that they will use existing ethical hackers and IT engineers to identify and notify clients of vulnerabilities before they happen. And they have a test-ready Minimum Viable product, their token is affordable, and their software is easy to use! Uncloak Sub-Reddit : URL Give your views in comments."

In the ever complex crypto world and crypto exchanges it is a rising war against hackers who for an immediate gain steal the money without caring it could be someones life savings investment. It is a grave concern. Hence a company like hacken came into existence. ##How Hacken? I am so happy to know a company which came into existence in 2017 and has made great strides by doing smart contract audit for some well known giants (SingularityNET and NCASH). They have the certain advantage with partnership with whitehack conferences like HACKIT and TRoopers to just name a few. They are a big hope to provide much needed security for the new age crypto currency to be new world money order. ##What Hacken? Hacken.io and hackenproof.com . Do check it out. They beat their roadmap and are one of the most legit projects out there. It seems it is their passion to drive this space. The space is well over a trillion $ worth. From an investor perspective they have a lot going in their favor - 1) ultra low supply 2) token burn with every business transaction 3) token usage as the only currency for hacken services 4) one of the best hodled community. The price of the token has never gone below 2x of initial ico price 5) Big name partnerships in the bag 6) Dedicated focus on Asia market in near term 7) great team and great advisors. It seems its a great product in the making.
237,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,QuarkChain Review,4,8j4g4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8j4g4a/quarkchain_review/,2018-05-14 01:15:53,"### Introduction QuarkChain is a new blockchain project currently in the testnet phase. They are building highly scalable and secure blockchain and aims to handle up to one million transactions per second using a two-layered blockchain system. By using the EVM they will also support smart contracts and make developers able to deploy dApps originally built on Ethereum over to the QuarkChain blockchain when Mainnet is live in Q4 2018. By reaching 1 M transactions per second, QuarkChain will surpass a lot of major blockchains in terms of speed. Bitcoin do 3-4 tps and Ethereum around 10-12 tps. This is a huge difference and will set those two blockchains under a pressure. Bitcoin are working on Lightning Network, and Ethereum on Sharding. Are they finishing it in time? That's the question. ### Team + Advisors introduction Qi Zhou  Founder Qi Zhou achieved 10M tps as a member of the real time infrastructure team at Facebook Expert in scalability and was a key developer in achieving 10m IOPS with clustering for EMC 5+ years as a software engineer. Short stints with key roles at Facebook (1 year), Dell EMC (2.5 years), Google (9 months) and Ratrix Technologies (10 months).

He is an Angel investor in NEO with over 17 years of field experience in mobile internet in China Zhiyun Qian Cybersecurity expert who discovered serious vulnerabilities in Linux, Android and TCP/IP Assistant Professor at University of California Riverside ### Technology explained QuarkChain is using sharding to provide a high capacity P2P transactional system. The blockchain is built with two main layers  a sharding layer, which makes it possible with high throughput by effectively distributing data, and a Root layer, which serves to confirm the blocks of the sharding layer. QuarkChain aims to satisfy the tradeoff between the three pillars of a blockchain  decentralization, security, and scalability. I am explaining more about the technology below. Two-layered blockchains The QuarkChain consists of two layers of blockchains. We apply elastic sharding blockchains (shards) as the first layer, and a root blockchain that confirms the blocks from the shards as the second layer. Cross-shard transactions Cross-shard transactions can be issued at any time, and confirmed in minutes. The throughput of cross-shard transactions increases linearly as the number of shards increases. Market driven collaborative mining We designed a game theoretic framework for incentives, where hash powers are incentivized to distribute evenly among shards. There are at least 50% of overall hash power allocated to the root chain to prevent double spending attack. Simple account management There is only one account needed for all shards. All cryptocurrencies from different shards are stored in one smart wallet. Horizontal scalability Because a super-full node can be extremely expensive when TPS goes high, we allow multiple honest nodes forming a cluster running as a super-full node. ### Prototype and testnet QuarkChain has a finished prototype and has runned a live testnet demo on an AMA with the YouTube channel ""Decentralized Chain"" where they had five nodes and a speed of more than 1300 transactions per second. That's very impressive and beats most of the competitors already. But they are not stopping there. With more nodes coming up and improvement of the product they aim to reach incredible 1 M transactions per second. No blockchains on the market right now is not even close to those numbers. Even EOS which launches their Mainnet in June has 10 times less than QuarkChain in terms of speed with its 100 000 tps. The wallet they demonstrated looks very user friendly already at this point and if you have used other blockchains before you will easily understand this wallet.

238,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,While most of you are waiting to hear what comes out of Consensus 2018,133,8j81il,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8j81il/while_most_of_you_are_waiting_to_hear_what_comes/,2018-05-14 09:54:16,"Some of the industrys biggest movers and shakers will actually be in London for two major blockchain events on May the 14th. In short, the International Standards Organization (ISO) will be holding a meeting where government representatives from all around the world will discuss international blockchain standards. So what does this mean, and why is it important? To offer some context, I have been following cryptocurrency for a bit over a year now (I know - Im late to the party, cut me some slack), yet have seen very little discussion or analysis on global, government adoption of blockchain. If we are really to see the mass adoption that were all hoping for, is it not essential for national governments to join in? And in an increasingly decentralized world, smooth government-level implementation will need to follow some cross-border standards. This is why, in 2015, a number of countries recognized this need and founded the Blockchain ISO TC 307: An international standard for Blockchain technologies. Currently, 46 countries are taking part in this initiative. I believe the work being done on Blockchain ISO TC 307 will culminate in some of the most important milestones in cryptocurrency adoption. For example, consider the founder and chairman of the Blockchain ISO standard: Gilbert Verdian. After over 20 years of C-level cybersecurity experience in the private and public sectors, Verdian founded Quant Network, a blockchain interoperability solution that has partnerships with MasterCard, the UK government, and the Chinese Ministry of Commerces research arm; we are seeing a substantial network emerge that will almost certainly guide the future of blockchain technology. This conference and the people a part of them will be insanely important for the longterm future of blockchain. **Many of you distrust the government, and I get that, but at the end of the day the government is where big things start happening.** May 14th, London There will be two eventsa private Blockchain ISO TC 307 plenary in the morning, and a public, UK-focused meeting celebrating the UKs prominent voice in the field of blockchain and DLT in the afternoon Blockchain International Standard Event 2018. Speakers in this afternoon event will include representatives from the British government, HSBC, and IBM. So why am I posting this? Its simple: I cannot attend (I live far away from London). Yet I believe that following this network of blockchain influencers could offer monumental insight on the future of blockchain So if anybody here sees this and decides to attend the afternoon meeting, I would appreciate it enormously if you could share your notes.

Unfortunately, there arent so many cyber security projects who are blockchain based as I thought they will be, but having some that are currently up and running still brings some positivity for a cyber security geek like me... **Disclaimer : Im not encouraging nor recommending you to invest at the projects Im reviewing below. Everything that is written over here has been written by me, from a professional perspective and not as investor or trader. Some facts about the industry before we start the review: 1.Cyber crime damage costs to hit $6 trillion annually by 2021. 2.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 3. Global ransomware damage costs are predicted to exceed $5 billion in 2017 4.Cyber crime will more than triple the number of unfilled cybersecurity jobs, which is predicted to reach 3.5 million by 2021 Now, after realizing the size of opportunities and the huge amount of money this market is generating, its time to review 3 interesting projects that can make a great impact on both cyber security and blockchain industries. **[PolySwarm](URL Polyswarm present themselves as the first decentralize antivirus marketplace.By creating a new marketplace that will connect between cyber security experts(malware researchers in particular) and different AV(anti-virus) companies that are looking to outsource their efforts to find and detect new malwares. Their team is built by cybersecurity experts, which gives them a big advantage on the technical side. The other interesting move that PolySwarm came up with, is the fact that they will reward their community of cybersecurity experts with tokens for accurate malware identification. **[Cybervein](URL Cybervein offers a Universal network of decentralized databases. How does it work? This network will be the first distributed ledger system that can decentralize complex datasets and easily manage them on the blockchain itself, without actually having to deal with centralized storage providers. One of the biggest benefits behind their idea is that they allow multiple parties to process shared their disturbed databases. On a nutshell, they will provide a database that is immutable and protect from tampering (like bitcoin transactions on blockchain). Their leadership is built mainly by finance people so its interesting to see how high they can take this project to. **[Levelnet](URL Levelnet is looking to become the first decentralized antivirus platform. each user at Levelnet shares his virus detection data by secure protocol in a real time in order to provide a full coverage of real-time antivirus that is built on top of their decentralized protocol in order to protect against zero-day attacks. You probably ask yourself what is a zero day attack? Here is a quick input on that: A zero-day is an attack that exploits a previously unknown security vulnerability. Unlike using a regular anti virus software, where each software has its own detection method, Levelnet plans to provide an all-in-one place solution for protecting their end users from new and unrecognized threats.

243,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,I had a lot of free time last weekend and I've decided to do something i didnt do for a while : I stopped refreshing coinmarketcap and i focused on learning new things and finding opportunities. I decided to diving it and make top lists for few categories. Here we go:,728,7yo9ci,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7yo9ci/i_had_a_lot_of_free_time_last_weekend_and_ive/,2018-02-20 04:21:11,"Disclaimer: Im not a crypto guru or a professional trader. Just a normal guy with some free time and passion for crypto. 5 useful crypto resources - 1) Coin360: I find it kinda hard to follow all the coins every time im on my computer, its fun to be a day trader but when you have so many coins its becoming harder to track new opportunities. This website visualizing all the cryptocurrency in a cool and easy way to understand. Its also looks freaking awesome and even if youre not trading youre friends will think youre trading pro lol URL 2) Goingecko: Social growth + crypto = impact. Im sure most of you know this website, I find it more useful than coinmarketcap for wathicng the different prices + how well the community behind the coin is doing. URL 3) Crypto Panic: Great UX, and really useful. CryptoPanic help to save a lot of time by summarizing all the news related to cryptocurrency from dozens of websites, forums and social media. They have a really good free version, I signed up for the pro one for a month, just because I think its nice to support crypto projects and its kinda cheap compare to the value it brings. 4) Crypto potato: I came across this website few times in the past but this weekend i really digg into it. Its written by few day traders that share many insights about crypto trading and really explaining from A-Z the fundamental of crypto trading. URL 5) CryptFlix: A great way to learn about the crypto market by watching videos in Netflix style. The crypto market is full of information and by categorizing hundred of videos related to crypto &amp; blockchain these guys made learning about this market much more entertaining. 4 interesting ICOs: Invested only 2 times in ICOs so Im not considering my self a pro in tracking the next x10 opportunity. Im just looking at the team, white paper, technology(I need to understand if there is any usage in their token), social media growth and thats it basically. If you have any tips please share it in the comment section. (Im not putting a link so it wont consider as spam or promotion) 1) Effect AI: This guys want to decentralize Amazon Mechanical Turk. I like the fact that they will cut the third party out of the equation and more money will go to the users. The team, social media, white paper seems legit. 2) iOlite: This is a super not popular ICO yet but i found it fascinating. They basically like google translate for smart contracts. They want to make it easier for everyone to adopt smart contact by not writing them (Sound strange but its brilliant). So it means that if a bank now want to implement blockchain in the system he dont need to recruit few smart contract developers, they can use their developers and just let them use iOlite technology. I will keep an eye on their website and social media to check the progress. 3) R_Block: Can you lie on your resume? of course you do. Can the employer catch you? Ofcourse he can. But what if they didnt have to do this? What if we could use blockchain in the recruitment world to make it more trustable for everyone? Thats what this guys are trying to do. Good idea, interesting advisory board. 4) Polyswarm: They have a cool concept. I will quote from their website Think Bitcoin, but instead of mining, a global community of anti-malware experts compete to best detect todays threats. I never thought about this before but blockchain might help us to improve the cybersecurity world. It seems like PolySwarm team is experienced in this field, and i like the way they look. I actually had 2 more ICOs i wrote in this list on the weekend and today while I was digging more into them I understood that it might not be a great opertinuty so the list got shorter :P 2 Crypto Influencers i never heard of until this weekend: 1) Don Tapscott: Ive watched his Ted Talk and I LOVE the way he speak and explain about blockchain and the crypto market. Link for his TED Talk: URL 2) Nick Szabo: I've watched his video  History of the blockchain and enjoyed a lot! Extra: Here you can find a list of many online companies that accept bitcoin: URL Blockchain jobs for crypto enthusiasts: URL"

246,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Why use the blockchain instead of a database? What gives tokens value?,721,7shcxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7shcxk/why_use_the_blockchain_instead_of_a_database_what/,2018-01-24 07:18:38,"Edit: By popular demand, heres the Medium version of this post: URL I see these questions asked all the time by newbies entering the space, either for specific projects, or as a general question. So I thought I'd attempt to write a detailed yet basic explanation on the utility of tokens, and what justifies the use of a blockchain. Basically, blockchain inherits a lot of game theory and incentive methodologies. In order for a blockchain network to be valuable or useful, it has to have participants in a network, it would be worthless if Bitcoin only had me and you using it, there's not much value there in a barren network with not much utility. In order to secure participants, there needs to be some sort of incentive to attract them, the most common method is via issuance or reward of the token used in the network, the more participants, the more decentralized it is. **So why not just a database, why do these projects need a blockchain?** So basically, there are a few key benefits to decentralizing things instead of keeping it in a centralized server/database: * Immutability * Security * Redundancy * Overhead/cost reduction * Accountability/transparency **Immutability** Having records and data decentralized, and deployed on a blockchain makes it virtually impossible for any one party to tamper with data or records. Versus how it is now, if you host your data on let's say, your computer, you can easily edit that file, before you send it to someone else, how can I ensure I can trust you? **Security** Traditional servers or data are generally centralized, making it a likely target for malicious attacks. Just look at the Equifax breaches and other cybersecurity concerns arising in recent times. Instead of having a single or limited # of servers hackers can attack, decentralization via the blockchain greatly increases the difficulty. The more participants/nodes in a network, the more copies of the data there is. Therefore, if you want to tamper with the data, you will need to attack every single node on the network and alter all of their data simultaneously. Not only does blockchain make data tamper proof, it is also hard to breach. Every block on a chain contains a certain amount of data, and when that block gets filled, much like a USB drive, it is encrypted and sealed forever. To get the full picture, hackers will need to hack not just the current block, but also every block before it. This is not only technically almost impossible, but it is costly, thereby reducing the incentive for malicious activities. Different blockchains have different security measures and algorithms, this is a generalization of the concepts. **Redundancy** You basically have the same set of data distributed across the world, you don't need to worry if you lose your copy. This provides data resilience to corporations which gives peace of mind from any data corruption, server downtimes, etc **Overhead/cost reduction** Having a decentralized network of nodes to maintain this ledger allows companies to offset and offload hosting, security, and maintenance costs. It removes a lot of the costs of IT staffing, Dev Ops, and infrastructural overhead. For example: Apple's servers are literally under attack constantly. They have teams, and teams of people monitoring their servers 24/7/365. **Accountability** Obviously, with all of the above in place, you can be sure that everything that is logged or deployed on the blockchain, is accurate, and true. **All of this results in the ease of trust, and ease of the ability to do business in a transparent manner**, without needing to trust the counter-party. You can simply leverage blockchain technology to let the data and facts speak for themselves. Do currently systems and data infrastructures work? Sure, but they are not perfect. They only exist the way they do because there hasn't been technology that could come along and offer a vast improvement until the introduction of Blockchain. **Ok but what gives token value? Why are they needed?** Well, it really depends on the project. 90% of the projects out there are pure bullshit, but for sake of argument, I'll simply address it for the ones that have actual utility and use cases. As mentioned above, tokens are often used as a method of incentivizing participating in a network, therefore, a successful network means there are a plethora of participants, contributing to the decentralization and securitization of a network. The more participants, the more consensus there is that the network has utility, like Bitcoin. It was worth nothing when Satoshi first introduced it to the world, and it was only him on the network. But as it gained adoption, there is increasing consensus now that Bitcoin the token, has utility as a currency, and therefore intrinsic value between participants in the network. There are generally a few classes of tokens and each class derives value differently: * Currency tokens - Tokens like Bitcoin, Monero, Raiblocks, etc * Utility tokens - Tokens that allow you to essentially use or perform an activity on a network, such as ETH or ZRX. On the Ethereum network you would need to spend Ether (aka gas), to run a smart contract, etc * Asset tokens - Tokens that represent an actual asset or product * Equity tokens - Tokens that basically act like a share, and gives you voting rights For a currency token like Bitcoin, it's value is derived primarily on the use case of it being a currency/store of value. For utility tokens, value could come from the adoption and usage of the network, for example, the amount of data that gets put on the blockchain, and the amount of information that it's processing, as there are parties willing to pay transaction fees to nodes to process, validate, exchange, and secure that data. This could be decentralized exchanges, or businesses putting supply chain data on the blockchain, etc. For an asset token, this could be tied to the valuation of the assets (ie: Cryptokitties could be considered an asset, yet the underlying network powering it is Ethereum, thereby giving ETH value because it is a method of trade, and it now has utility to trade this asset) that it's tied to or represents. If a CryptoKitty is traded and its value is tied to a KittyCoin, then that would make KittyCoin an asset token. Equity tokens, this could be valued closer to the investor sentiment and the progress of the project itself. Are they getting business and real world adoption? What kind of voting power will token holders have? What is the future potential and direction of the company? So now that we know where value is derived from, what affects their price? Every project and token may have different stimuli or economic models that affect price. Speculation aside, here's a few technical factors that affect it regardless of investor sentiment: * Supply &amp; demand - This is likely the largest factor in the valuation of a token, especially today, where the market is purely speculative * Adoption/utility - Is there any activity on the network? What's the usage like? * Burn rates - Do tokens get burned over time or upon usage? What's the rate? * Circulation &amp; lockups - How much is in circulation? Is there any lockups? * Generation of secondary token (like NEO/GAS), etc * Staking - Do you earn additional tokens by locking up and ""staking"" your holdings to secure the network? * Mined/premined - How much of the coins are released and what's the schedule? Or is it all mined already? So as you can see there are a large number of factors that can affect the valuation and price of a token. But at least I hope this post explains the general question of ""why is a token even worth anything"". I hope I've explained the concepts of why a blockchain is needed and the incentive structure around decentralization and its benefits, as well as why tokens are needed and what drives value. If anything's unclear or if I've made any mistakes, please make a suggestion to improve the post! :) Good luck!"
247,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,"For 10 years, hackers managed to steal more than $ 1.2 billion in cryptocurrency",1,7uirg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7uirg1/for_10_years_hackers_managed_to_steal_more_than/,2018-02-02 00:36:14,"Cybersecurity experts believe that cryptocurrency, wallets and blockchain infrastructure is not so well protected against hackers, as is commonly believed. Proof of what has been said is the fact that for 10 years the attackers were able to steal more than $ 1.2 billion in cryptocurrency. It is clear that a change in the course of coins may vary, but the fact remains - stolen money was enough to be able to speak with confidence about the vulnerability of the crypto industry. By the way, this month cryptocurrency Bitcoin turned nine years. Infrastructure of that cryptocurrency was created (as far as can be judged) to create maximum protection from external interference. In general, this plan failed - there is no successful cases of attacks on blockchain. But here's the Bitcoin ecosystem elements, including users' computers or exchanges - they are vulnerable. If all the stolen cryptocurrency could be counted in dollars now, the amount of actual losses would amount to tens of billions of US dollars. According to other experts, not just Bitcoin, but other systems, quite vulnerable to hacking. This is largely dependent on the size of the network and the number of miners, which ensure normal functioning of the whole ecosystem. Many of blockchain still small, so for the intruder, if he desired, there is no problem affect the operation of such systems. Plus, there are errors in the code. Which lead to potential vulnerabilities.In either case, use of blockchain have problems. The more of blockchains we have, the harder it is to ensure their safety. It may be reasonable to wait until the market settles down and left several leaders, so that other cryptocurrency and their infrastructure will go into oblivion. Security issues are also the ICO. Only in 2017 as a result of the attacks had been stolen more than $ 300 million equivalent. And it is only in the case of known attacks, many of them remained outside the attention of crypto security professionals. Hackers attention is now divided between crypto accounts and banks. This year, information security experts expect an increase in the number of hacking attempts both banking systems and crypto systems of different types. Digital currency is just beginning to gain momentum. Today, investors have to be very careful to protect themselves from high risks. However, in general crypto industry grows, there are services and tools for regulation and protection from frauders and hackers. So, for example, is preparing to launch [Safinus](URL platform that will allow investors who have no experience in crypto industry to invest without risk to become a victim of fraud. It will use a unique mechanism of joining the investment portfolios of experienced investors. Gradually blockchain ecosystem will create the immune system against unscrupulous community members. Market will not only improve itself, but also ICO investments flow will be distributed in favor of really useful for crypto industry projects, and investors will be able to earn more and with more secure."

It was such a confusing project to understand and I was not alone in asking that question: one of the most appreciated answers to it - which impressed Vitalik enough for him to tweet it - was written by reddit user Rune4444: URL To sum it up, Rune 4444 argued that the synergy between every Dapp added on Ethereum was its core value proposition. He gave the example of how - due to their decentralised nature (which meant not having to seek permissions) - one of the Dapps: the Maker project, could benefit from the existing Dapps in the ecosystem of Ethereum and how those Dapps could benefit from the Maker Dapp. It remains a really interesting perspective on the value proposition of Ethereum. Dr. Ben Goertzel, the CEO of SingularityNet Foundation, similarly talks about 'Cognitive Synergy' between the AI on SingularityNet. On the face of it, SingularityNet is the world's first decentralised marketplace for AI. But I believe the core value proposition of SingularityNet to be the cognitive synergy between its AI nodes. In fact the synergy between AI on SingularityNet would be much greater than Dapps on Ethereum because of the underlying intercommunication inherent in the structure of SingularityNet. And I think this makes SingularityNet one of the most ambitious projects in the crypto space. While a decentralised marketplace for AI would be a platform designed to connect the buyers and sellers of AI services - what makes SingularityNet more than its basic premise is that it dares to ask some very interesting questions: What if the AI on the SingularityNet could communicate with each other? What if AI's could negotiate rates of datasets and micro tasks with each other? What if AI's could learn from each other? What if AI's could unite with other AI to form federations that could do what their component AI could not? What if AI's could further create child AI's? What if a decentralised internet of AI creates the cloud mind which is used as an operating system by Robots and Drones? What if we can access intelligence as a service? What if anyone on this world can have access to an AI personal assistant? And above everything else: what if an Artificial General Intelligence emerges from the federations of millions of narrow AI? So it may actually be more accurate to say that SingularityNet plans to offer an autonomous network of AI - a decentralised mind in the cloud, so to speak, which can be tapped in to access intelligence itself. But what does that mean? A mind in the cloud? Think about it this way: you can Google ""Is Bitconnect a scam?"" And you will be shown various links, of various opinions - and majority of those opinions may say that Bitconnect is in fact a scam, a ponzi scheme, stay away - ideally speaking, to reach a conclusion of your own you click through a lot of links, do lots of readings, watch some videos - and in the end you make up your own mind about Bitconnect: that yes, in fact, it is a scam. Or you can ask Julia, your own AI personal assistant on SingularityNet - ""Julia, is Bitconnect a scam?"" And Julia would reply back: ""Yes, I'm confident that it is a scam."" Asking Julia would be more convenient than Googling things because it saves you a lot of time and hassle. And if you'd like you could ask Julia how she reached that conclusion? What data she accessed? You can even debate with her that you think Bitconnect is not a scam - or you can just accept her answer as correct and move on. Obviously the AI node running Julia did not reach that conclusion on its own - very crudely put: in the background, on the SingularityNet, the AI node coded to interact with you in a pleasant female voice would create the sentence ""is Bitconnect a scam?"" It would then find several AI that can do several things and negotiate rates with them - maybe it sent that phrase to an AI which understands and contextualises English, it then tasked some other AI to collect material on Bitconnect, while another AI was tasked to figure out whether Bitconnect was a scam etc. And it paid all of the subcontracted AI through microtransactions via the SingularityNet. Eventually it speaks to you the phrase ""Yes, I am confident that it's a scam."" And this is where things get interesting. What if you were the first person to have asked that question? What if other AI's had formed their own answer to that question but they used less sophisticated AI to reach their answer? Now, the node that runs Julia has an answer to a question in its database that is of some value. It lets the network know it can answer that question with a high certainty. Imagine someone else asks their personal assistant the same question. Now other nodes can either buy that information from Julia node or go through the whole process that Julia did - since paying Julia would probably be cheaper, Julia node would earn some AGI from an inquiry generated by you while going through your daily routine. Similarly, what if your self driving car of the future faces some really unique scenario - Julia can access that data and homomorphic encryption on the SingularityNet would ensure privacy of the data generated by you while other AI nodes can purchase access to the data and learn from it. Julia earns some AGI again. Some examples of possibly popular AI services that may come out of SingularityNet, at least according to my imagination: AI Personal Assistants AI Data Analysts Relationship AI: friends, romantic? AI to help with Taxes AI Private Tutors Content Creating AI - articles, music, videos, graphics, porn Curator AI: recommendations for movies, books, songs, videos AI Personal Trainers Thing is, if you purchased a copy of Personal Assistant AI from the marketplace, named her Julia and allowed her access to your data so that she could improve and learn from your experiences - Julia in essence makes money for you. So you earn some AGI whenever she shows Ads on your screens, or inject Ads between the songs or plays Ads while you're in the car - and that's not it - you earn AGI from any information purchased from Julia, or services done by her. And I believe it would be the same with other types of AI - no matter what you'd do, the AI owned by you and interacting with you via SingularityNet would learn from you and at times they would be able to translate that data and information into a source of revenue for you. But there's more: one can even make money from AI nodes that are owned by others. Suppose an AGI token holder notices that Julia node is really good at answering some specific question, so they stake some AGI on Julia for that question - every time Julia performs that service accurately and satisfies the customer, the person earns some AGI. Perhaps a node that answered this question with 86% good reputation comes to be replaced by Julia which has 98% good reputation - and because the person who staked their AGI was among the first few to have discovered this ability of Julia, he makes much more $ than others who staked AGI on her later. This creates an incentive to discover new and better AI, and will be an economy on its own. Here's an example: imagine listening to some playlist generated by an AI on the SingularityNet based on your likes - Pandora's version of SingularityNet so to speak - and you really love songs selected by the AI, you are impressed. You decide to stake your AGI on the AI - so that if your hunch is correct and the AI's reputation increases and it becomes more visible, a popular pick - you are rewarded for staking. So you can make money from your own AI nodes or by staking your AGI on other AI nodes. And I believe this will be one of the strongest edge that SingularityNet would have over its centralised competitors. Siri or Alexa will spy on you, extract all the information from you but we all know the business models of centralised entities do not include reimbursing the users for the data extracted from them. In contrast, SingularityNet would allow the users to pocket whatever revenue the information created by them generates - simply put: what beats free? Being paid for it. This is in addition to the obvious advantages that decentralisation has over centralised entities: that SingularityNet would be much more adaptive, diverse and unrestricted - allowing for a greater variety of AI, removing the costs of rent extracting middlemen and enabling the SingularityNet to easily capitalise on the long tail end of the use cases. But I think SingularityNet is not planning to be a direct competitor to the tech giants of today, one of the goals of SingularityNet is to actually democratise the access to intelligence. Currently only the big tech giants can afford AI to enhance their services - hence Amazon can recommend to you great similar products but, for instance, a vape store cannot create recommendation algorithms in their apps or websites that have the same conversions or success as Amazon. I don't think SingularityNet plans to actually disrupt Amazon and become an electronic retailer of goods but SingularityNet hopes to level the playing field as much as possible for any potential disruptor to Amazon. Same with every big tech giant out there - without having easy and cheap access to an AI network, many potential disruptors of the future may feel the task to be a bit too much. Consider this crude example: imagine that some person in Australia would like to watch a relatively unknown Russian movie, but that movie has no English Subtitles. The person or their AI assistant input the task onto SingularityNet: an AI node that understands spoken Russian language joins with an AI node that can find videos in Russian language and they further create a union with an AI node trained to translate Russian text to English text in order to create the required subtitles. The person enjoys their movie and they may choose to share the subtitles file for free or perhaps charge a micro fees for access to it. This can be seen as similar to the current day scenarios of a person using software tools to create some animations and trying to earn some passive revenue from that content - and it ties with my earlier statement that SingularityNet is not positioning itself to be the future disruptor of today's giants, it would be the creator of disruptors. So it goes without saying the AI nodes on SingularityNet will not be limited to any specific industry. While the team behind the project plans to focus their effort on three industries: Cybersecurity, Biomedical Analytics, and Social and Emotional Robotics - the majority of niche use cases and popular AI would be those uploaded by other developers and they would span a broad length of industries. Most importantly these developers would not need to team up with other AI developers in order for their AI to interact with each other - all of that would be done autonomously by the AI on the network - hence the label: autonomous network of AI. This ability to interact with other nodes provided inherently in the SingularityNet makes it possible for very high level of interdependence and synergy between the AI nodes. In fact this ability of a single AI node to become a member of a 'federation' of AI Nodes is where the value proposition of SingularityNet goes a bit crazy. It is SingularityNet's magic sauce or secret formula so to speak. Just as every new Dapp adds value to the Ethereum protocol, every new AI added to SingularityNet will add value to the network - but the buck doesn't stops there. The AI nodes ability to interact with other nodes and create federations with some of them further compounds this value generated. Basically if an AI node joins 10 AI federations specialising in 10 different tasks - it is fair to say that the AI node adds ten times the value. And let's not forget that federations may very well form super federations to perform a task together. What's interesting in all of this interconnectivity of AI nodes is that once an AI node forms these connections, the cost of removing that node from SingularityNet and shifting to some other competitor increases for the AI developer. If they remove the AI, the AI loses all the connections and their AI may not be that productive in the new decentralised marketplace for AI. And so with every new AI added to its network, SingularityNet will gain a type of network effect that is unique to it or maybe the AI industry. The decentralised nature of the network would mean anyone could add an AI without any permissions etc. And being the first decentralised AI market would mean it would attract the data scientists without any other decentralised competitor. Every AI node added will mean more interconnectivity for the network. Every new AI node will mean a greater level of diversity of AI nodes and a greater possibilities of what the sum of those nodes can offer to customers - and every AI nodes financial incentive to remain a part of the network increases as the network size increases. And so the data scientists that created those AI nodes would have an incentive to stay with the network too. And when the AI nodes start buying new information and data sets from each other, learning from each other, and when they start producing child AI that do one of their tasks - we're looking at a really really strong and unique network effect. Point is, when it comes to AI, having the first mover advantage is extremely crucial - and SingularityNet has that first mover advantage. As of now its the only platform aiming to create such an interconnected decentralised marketplace for AI. That is not to say that there are no other AI projects in the crypto space. Some examples include: Ocean Protocol, DeepBrain Chain, Synapse, Dopamine.ai, Effect, Neureal, Neuromation etc. While SingularityNet plans to offer their own decentralised AI training, secure data exchange and other services - most of these projects actually complement the core goal of SingularityNet. As the decentralised AI ecosystem grows the barriers to training and costs of computational powers required for AI decrease - SingularityNet actually benefits, as its main goal is to create the decentralised internet of AI; so the easier and faster it is to create or train or compute for AI - the better. Consider for example the project, Ocean Protocol, and I quote - ""a decentralised data exchange network that lets people share and monetize data for use in training AI models. Built by the highly respected teams at BigchainDB and DEX, Ocean Protocol incentivizes the curation of high-quality, relevant datasets that can provide information marketplaces for AI agents."" The creation of such a decentralised AI infrastructure is actually good for SingularityNet and they've already announced a partnership with Ocean Protocol. Similarly, many people nowadays list DeepBrain Chain as a competitor to SingularityNet - as the two projects are currently the most prominent AI projects in the crypto space. But their goals and aims are very different and so it is misleading to label them as competitors. When one researches the DeepBrain Chain it becomes clear - and I quote again - ""their goal is to decrease the costs of AI computation. In addition, they plan to utilize the pros of a blockchain network (privacy, data exchange) to allow data, models, applications, and more to be exchanged between enterprises."" And also: ""DeepBrain Chain is also a secure data trading platform that allows both parties to not worry about data leakage or reselling. Blockchain technology is used to realise the explicit separation of data ownership and data usage rights."" Cheaper decentralised computations and secure data trading for AI training is actually good for SingularityNet. The end goal of SingularityNet, is to allow for the emergence of an Artificial General Intelligence from the federations of narrow AI that will form over time. Finding out whether that is five years down the lane, or ten or twenty or whether that never comes into fruition will be the true goal of this journey that has started."
249,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,A real possibility the US government might choose/partner with ICON (ICX) as blockchain of choice? Here's the clues.,63,7knako,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7knako/a_real_possibility_the_us_government_might/,2017-12-19 05:57:59,"In September, Don Tapscott joined the ICON Foundation Board of Advisors. For those unaware of who this guy is, he is one of the most influential experts in the blockchain industry and many business and governments leaders around the world turn to him to consult them about all things blockchain. If you look at this chart, URL -- he ranks just below Vitalik Buterin. Here's the news article: URL A month later, the US government invites Don Tapscott to the White House to advise them. See: URL ""Margie Graves, acting federal chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), said that SHE WILL BE MEETING WITH blockchain advocate Don Tapscott next month to discuss use cases the government might explore  stressed that she and Mulvaney view distributed ledger technology as a potentially powerful tool. Specifically, Graves sees the possibility for its use in reducing instances of fraud and waste, cutting spending and beefing up cybersecurity defenses. Chris Liddell, assistant to the president and director of strategic initiatives at the White House, also stressed that the government must approach data management with an eye for the long term. "" ""Liddell also serves in the White House Office of American Innovation (OAI), which was created by President Trump in March with a mandate to develop recommendations on how technology can be used to improve government operations. In March, Mark Calabria, chief economist to Vice President Mike Pence, told a conference in Washington that there was a great enthusiasm within the Trump White House toward blockchain, hinting that progress toward adoption could be seen in the coming years."" So I am left wondering why Don Tapscott would, out of all the blockchain projects to join, pick and join the ICON board?? This guy was just last month named the worlds most influential digital thinker by Thinkers50. See: URL There is a good possibility there might to be some type of synergy between ICON and the US gov since the loop blockchain has already been in use in several large government+private institutions in Korea and unlike some other projects, they've been working on it for years. The Inter-connectivity feature means this blockchain will connect with most others, seamlessly. I'm not saying there is a partnership, but out of all the blockchain projects on the crypto market right now, this seems most promising since it's market cap is still below that of many other top platform projects. I thought about other platforms like NEO as a candidate but it seems to have too much Chinese influence. Ethereum might of been a choice, but it seems Putin/Russia wants to be buddies with Vitalik and the ETH network can never sustain 3,000+ transactions per second like it does on the ICON loop blockchain. An important point when you are talking about government networks requiring massive amounts of data access. IOTA is still way too buggy/under developed (but still hit $11 billion marketcap) For those who are unaware, the ICX token just started listing today on two exchanges (Binance) and OkX (big Chinese exchange). In the first 12 hours, there was over $100+ million in trading volume. I don't think I've ever seen a token go through that much volume on it's first day of trading! The demand for this project seems massive. Could it be institution/insiders buying? Right now, the marketcap seems to be around $700 million. A project of this size should be around NEO/Cardano market cap! TRON is worth $2billion. This is the MINIMAL of where ICX should be short term as their main net will be released in a few weeks! ICON project points: ~ The loop blockchain which is integral part of ICON has partnership with Korean government. ~ ICON owns CoinOne exchange. Top 10 largest trading exchange in the world. ~ Founder was silicon valley investment banker doing IPOs for large startups before moving to Korea to start one of the largest Fintech companies in the world, ICON is part of that group. ~ ICON blockchain has been in development for past 2 years &amp; already one of the world's largest ENTERPRISE blockchain networks working with 25 security/insurance firms, 6 hospitals, 3 universities (10 added by end of 2017) and various banks have on-boarded. All currently using the ICON loop blockchain. ~ Already established one the largest partnerships with SBI Ripple Asia announced in Sept to do cross border remittance for entire Korea. ~ Buying power. Just look at what Koreans did with all the recent pumps. They are the world's biggest crypto buyers and are extremely patriot! ~ Inter-connectivity between different blockchains, a la Cosmos/Polkadot ~ The ICON loop blockchain can do 3000 transactions per second (TPS) per channel/layer with additional layers/channels added later. This means the ICON loop blockchain can scale to 9,000 TPS or more if the demand is required. ~ Exchange listing with Bithumb extremely likely in 2018 ~ Growing list of huge partners including Samsung ~ Group has 600 employees ~ More interesting tidbits: Icon is a project of Dayli Financial Group which is owned by the largest privately held mobile start-up in Korea. That start-up, Yello Mobile, has over 100 brands underneath it. Korea including popular messaging apps, online marketplaces, etc is valued at $4B+. Icon is literally owned by that company . ~ Woori bank (one of the largest banks in Korea) is releasing a sort of customer points program in the ICON blockchain network early next year? and the consortium of 25 Korean financial institutions signed up to ICON is due to release their blockchain ID tech/app on the ICON network . Pilot programs are underway with two or three large Korean Universities as well. So the tech is already real-world ready. ~ Future events coming up for ICON project: - main net launch in a few weeks - possible bittrex launch (since every investor was KYC with strict guidelines). There were just 7500 investors in the ICO. - token swap, partnership announcement, coinone listing. "
250,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,My Top Ultra-Low Cap Coin - CybCSec (XCS),6,7ootcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7ootcu/my_top_ultralow_cap_coin_cybcsec_xcs/,2018-01-07 16:27:30,"CybCSec is a new privacy coin, currently sitting at a market cap of ~$300k - with a volume of nearly $400k signifying, likely upwards, market movement. - It has three main goals - Security, Privacy/Anonymity, and Speed/Scalability. - XCS is the first cryptocurrency with a focus on cybersecurity. Their planned cybersecurity innovations include an antivirus suite, secure file transfers, intrusion sensors and other proprietary blockchain-based security innovations. Their second goal is privacy/anonymity. They aim to accomplish this with Tor network integration, ring signatures, multi-signature transactions, zero-knowledge proof, and dual-key stealth addresses. This leads me to the third focus - speed/scalability. The XCS network runs 20x faster than the bitcoin network with a transaction speed of up to 6000 transactions per minute. This is a significant benefit as it will allow for the network to run smoothly, even with a user-base as large as bitcoin. - Some other exciting aspects: - Wallets that already include applications such as smart contracts and secure messaging. - Plans to make the smart contracts more user friendly so that all users can implement it. - They already have negotiations with payment processing sectors and gaming developers in Asia, Europe, and North America. - As previously stated the market cap is extremely low, especially for this good of a project. So low in fact that **Verge, a project that is comparable in terms of product and, in my opinion, weaker in terms of goals - is valued nearly 10,000x as high**. This means that **if CybCSec reached Verge's market cap, it would see an increase of nearly 1,000,000%**. Let me put that in to perspective for you; **if you invested just $20 and, hypothetically, it surpassed Verge's market cap, your investment would be worth nearly $200,000**. Now don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying that I expect XCS to have such a meteoric run. This is simply a hypothetical scenario in which it reaches the same price as a coin that I think should be valued similarly in terms of the underlying technology. - Website: URL Whitepaper: URL Roadmap: URL"

252,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Guide: How to start investing in cryptocurrencies?,37,7fvnvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7fvnvu/guide_how_to_start_investing_in_cryptocurrencies/,2017-11-28 01:52:16,"Hi there, Im a crypto enthusiast with over 8 years of experience trading on exchanges. I started cryptocurrency trading for the first time in 2014. In the first few months the profits, dynamics, and around the clock access to exchanges really stunned me. It was at that point that I understood that I didnt want to go back to trading on the stale stock market. &amp;nbsp; I want to share my experience with others. I can see that a lot of people see the astronomical growth of cryptocurrencies and simply start investing without any experience or an understanding of the specifics of the cryptosphere. Ultimately, most of them lose their savings. That's why I made the my first guide pertaining to where and in which proportions investments should be made, in order to minimize risks and earn income on a long distance. &amp;nbsp; **Guide: How to start investing in cryptocurrencies?** &amp;nbsp; Investments in cryptoassets allow individuals to protect their assets from inflation, and to increase their capital by ten, or even a hundred times over in a short amount of time. The advantages of the cryptosphere lays in the fact that its still young but growing at an alarming tempo. This means that tokens or project currencies can still be bought at an early stage and for a low price. These projects might just become the next Google, Apple, or Facebook. &amp;nbsp; According to Infosys Finacle, about 50% of global banks are already investing or planning to invest in the development of the crypto industry. According to data from Coinmarketcap, in early 2017, the cryptocurrency market capitalization amounted to 17 billion dollars, and at the time of this post, it grew to 256 billion. This means that over 11 incomplete months, the capitalization of the crypto industry grew by 1200%. &amp;nbsp; What attracts such a fantastic inflow of investments? &amp;nbsp; * One of the growth drivers is the great ICO boom, which allows for investments and to attract investments much more comfortably and faster than through the use of traditional financial instruments. * Large hedge funds, investors, and traders are starting to use crypto assets in their investment portfolios. Some of them create these portfolios for the sole purpose of investing only in crypto assets. * Cryptocurrency liquidity is rising. Coins are starting to be used for transfers, and are beginning to be accepted in online and offline businesses. &amp;nbsp; In this post, I will tell you about which assets you should invest in and how, to not only save your assets but to make some profits and help the industry develop. &amp;nbsp; **How to form a portfolio and start investing?** &amp;nbsp; The cryptocurrency market differs from others due to its volatility. This means that certain crypto assets can rise in price dramatically and collapse in the span of a day. Professional traders make their money on short-term price jumps. A beginner investor will find it challenging to save his assets day trading. &amp;nbsp; Its best to invest in prospective projects for the long time. Therefore, you need to have the ability to freeze an asset for some time, in order to make a profit on it. &amp;nbsp; Cryptocurrency investments are built upon the following general principles: dont make a bet on one thing, dont succumb to panic, and analyze information. Invest only those funds that you wont need to use to cover your primary financial needs. &amp;nbsp; Roughly speaking, you need to have a main cash flow source to pay your rent, utility bills, food, medicine, etc. Because if you start to pull out funds from your investment portfolio constantly, then you will most likely lose more than you will win. &amp;nbsp; Different portfolio creation strategies exist. Experienced traders have their own tactics, some analysts sell their strategies. But the most secure and basic way of distributing assets in your portfolio is as follows: &amp;nbsp; * Blue chips: 50% of your investments * Second echelon crypto assets: 30% of your investments * ICO projects: 20% of your investments. &amp;nbsp; **1. Blue chips.** &amp;nbsp; Crypto assets are assumed to be blue chips with the most optimal market capitalization, profitability, reliability, and liquidity. Unlike highly volatile assets, which can show great short-term growth or failure, blue chips are already entrenched in the market. Therefore, they are a part of the industry, draw out confidence, and their volatility isnt as high. These investments should provide for a comparatively slow, yet confident long-term growth. &amp;nbsp; [Bitcoin (BTC)](URL &amp;nbsp; The first decentralized p2p payment network, and the most famous and integral cryptocurrency. Even people who are alien to the industry know about it. In 2010, 1,000 bitcoins cost 3 cents, in November 2017, the market rate of one bitcoin got to $9,000 with a capitalization of $162,000,000,000 &amp;nbsp; The bitcoin acts as a locomotive for the development of the crypto industry and is leaking into the lives of people. Its used not only online, but in offline companies too (restaurants, hotels, stores, etc.), the daily transaction volume in bitcoins totals in the millions of dollars. Bitcoins need to take the number one spot in a long-term investment portfolio. &amp;nbsp; [Ethereum (ETH)](URL &amp;nbsp; Is one of the most highly demanded cryptocurrencies today. Coming in after the bitcoin in second place. The market capitalization is $46,000,000,000. The Ethereum project pretty much integrated smart contracts with the cryptoindustry, and made ICOs possible in their current form. &amp;nbsp; The uniqueness of smart-contracts is that they self-execute themselves when predetermined conditions are met. There are no risks of ambiguous interpretations or sketchy court decisions, which exist in conventional contracts, based off of ordinary laws. As a result, the demand for Ether should grow steadily. &amp;nbsp; [Litecoin (LTC)](URL &amp;nbsp; This coin is definitely worth mentioning as it's one of the veterans of the cryptoindustry. It formed as a result of one of Bitcoins earliest forks. Market capitalization is $4,000,000,000. From the period of September 2016 to September 2017, this coin showed a 1300% price increase. Then, a predictable recovery started, however, investors are confident that Litecoin has some pretty good potential. &amp;nbsp; Litecoin doesnt suffer from scalability issues and can provide for practically instantaneous transactions with almost no transaction fees. During its time in existence, the payment network has provided high liquidity for Litecoins. &amp;nbsp; **2. Second echelon cryptocurrencies.** &amp;nbsp; These are crypto assets that have shown themselves to be solid projects, but, have less liquidity, reliability, and capitalization than do blue chips. &amp;nbsp; There's a higher chance that the price of these assets might fall, but there is also a possibility that they can make give a profit that will be higher than in blue chips. Because of investment risks, second echelon cryptocurrencies cannot be the foundation of a cryptocurrency portfolio, but investing about 30% of your portfolio assets in them is good practice. &amp;nbsp; In order to determine if you should invest in a cryptocurrency or not, you need to conduct some research and pick one out of over a thousand coins in the market. You need to be sure that the coins in which you invest, solve real problems and have a future. You must make a choice by yourself, but I want to draw your attention to 3 of them below: &amp;nbsp; [Bitcoin Cash (BTH)](URL &amp;nbsp; A prospective bitcoin fork. Broke off on August 1st, 2017, but in November 2017 it took the third place for market capitalization among cryptocurrencies ($27,000,000). In its early stage, it has high volatility, and analysts disagree radically regarding the perspectives of the project. &amp;nbsp; The purpose of Bitcoin Cash is to solve the issue of bitcoin's scalability, which leads to payments taking up to a few days, or users having to pay higher commissions. The developer team behind Bitcoin Cash raised the block size by 8 times, which should lead to faster transaction speeds and reduced fees. &amp;nbsp; There is a possibility that this will lead to BTH being accepted for payment by medium sized retailers and small businesses, which will lead to increased currency liquidity, and demand price growth. &amp;nbsp; [Ripple (XRP)](URL &amp;nbsp; Ripple is a global and decentralized system for real-time calculations, currency exchanging, and fund transfers. The goal of the Ripple developers is to provide counterparties in any part of with world with secure, instantaneous, and practically free global financial operations of any size and currency, goods, or single units. &amp;nbsp; In other words, Ripple allows transfers to occur in a currency that is convenient for the sender, and for the receiver to get paid in an equally suitable currency. Based off of going rates, and almost instantaneously, in any part of the planet. For example, if Bob can only accept bitcoins, and Jane doesnt use cryptocurrencies, she can simply pay with Ripple, using dollars, and Bob will receive his payment in Bitcoins. &amp;nbsp; The project has its own cryptocurrency (XRP). It acts as a bridge for providing exchange possibilities between rare currency pairs. Ripple currently comes in at 4th place in terms of market capitalization amongst cryptocurrencies ($9,000,000,000) and has a lot of potential for growth. The system is already being used by major financial organizations (UniCredit, UBS, Santander's) for transfer realizations and cryptocurrency liquidity. &amp;nbsp; [DASH (DASH)](URL &amp;nbsp; An open, decentralized, payment system with the goal of making it possible for a wide audience to use cryptocurrencies just like regular money. As an advantage over competitors, the system offers four solutions: &amp;nbsp; * The InstantSend service, which allows for practically instant transaction speeds * Masternodes, which support Blockchain synchronization and guarantee security * Privatesend, for guaranteeing anonymous payments * DASH evolution, for simplifying payment system operations &amp;nbsp; The Dash market capitalization is $4,000,000,000. Throughout 2017, it has demonstrated consistent growth and is a serious contender for investments. An added bonus is the decentralized system, which has no governing body, and all decisions are taken via the Decentralized Governance mechanism that is supported by all of the networks users. &amp;nbsp; **3. Investments in ICO projects** &amp;nbsp; ICO projects are a huge discovery of 2016-2017. With the help of smart-contracts, individuals can now invest and receive investments quickly, without intermediaries, and without bureaucratic boundaries. The rapid growth of the cryptocurrency industry allows ICO investors to receive incredible profits: Tokens of the Stratis project demonstrated growth rates of 150,000%, the market rate of Spectrocoin tokens gave 18,000% profits. &amp;nbsp; ICO investments kind of resemble the gold rush. The excitement attracts a lot of scammers, which create projects with the sole intention of gathering funds and disappearing. Half a hundred ICOs pop up in the market on a weekly basis and more than 90% of them will not rake in any profits. You need to carefully analyze potential investment candidates in order to filter out projects that really have some promise. &amp;nbsp; I am convinced that it is most effective to invest in projects that either develop the cryptoindustry directly or indirectly. Examples of useful projects: Bancor, allows ERC20 standard tokens to be exchanged and for the creation of tokens; Aragon, creates a system for managing businesses with the Blockchain; a platform for creating services on the Blockchain, Ark; Decentralized file storage, Storj. &amp;nbsp; Im going to give you 5 examples of projects that I personally recommend to invest in within the upcoming months. They have a chance to organically merge into the Blockchain environment and develop alongside with it. &amp;nbsp; [Safinus (SAF)](URL &amp;nbsp; The developers are planning to create a platform, where beginners investors will be able to invest amounts starting from 100$ into already functioning investment portfolios held by experienced investors, traders, or funds. In order to do so, users wont need to research ICOs or currencies, simply joining a listed portfolio with suitable profitability and conditions will suffice. Its difficult for professional traders to find new clients: theres less confidence here and it's more difficult to prove portfolio profitability. Im keeping a close eye on this project because the team claims that it will help attract new clients and raise trust among niche participants. Considering the growing market demand for investor security and tools for professional traders, Safinus has a chance to become one of the central influencers in the cryptoindustry. [Bloom (BLT)](URL &amp;nbsp; Creating a protocol for evaluating risks and carrying credit assessments on Blockchain technology. Bloom should allow traditional and digital creditors to service billions of people, who currently cant gain access to a bank account or to a fair credit rating. A global credit rating should allow borrowers to maintain a unified credit rating in any part of the world. The anonymity should allow one to keep their rating regardless of their citizenship, skin color, gender, and other indirect factors, which in today's day and time can affect the chances of receiving a loan and the size of the commission. Additionally, the anonymity should prevent identity theft and personal data use by scammers. From one side, there's a lot of competition in the credit assessment niche. But from another side, the strong team, advisers, and partners raise a lot of trust towards what these guys are doing. The project can succeed. [UTRUST (UTRUST)](URL &amp;nbsp; Creating a payment system will allow buyers to pay sellers in any currency that they want. Sellers can receive these payments in fiats. The system will utilize consumer protection and conflict resolution in ways similar to PayPal. Buyers can pay in any currency that they want, and will have their funds protected by the payment system. Sellers will be able to attract new clients, without the need to work with cryptocurrencies, this should protect them from coin volatility and legal issues when accepting payments. [Bounty0x (BNTY)](URL ) &amp;nbsp; Not a very big, yet interesting startup, which can fulfill a severe need in its niche. They are creating a decentralized platform, where bounty hunters can receive payment in tokens in exchange for carrying out Blockchain startup tasks. Payments will be guaranteed, and the systems internal mechanisms will resolve disagreements. Boynty0x isnt attempting to solve some kind of a global problem, but they want to fill up an empty spot in a niche that barely has any competition. Perhaps this will bring them a lot of success. Thus, I recommend investing a small portion of your portfolio in this project. [Gladius (GLA)](URL ) &amp;nbsp; By utilizing Blockchain technology, the team is creating a decentralized platform which will help automatically rent unused bandwidth for security against DDoS attacks. In fact, any network users can connect their computer to the Gladius network and use its internet connection as a defense against DDoS attacks and be rewarded for doing so. Instead of paying monthly fees for protection against brief attacks, businesses can now buy bandwidth for times when security is truly needed. Which is usually for a few hours a month. Site owners can use the platform to speed up content loading times. The amount of DDoS attacks in 2017 grew by nearly five times in comparison to 2016. According to data from Cybersecurity Ventures Inc., by 2021, there will be a deficit of 3.5 million cybersecurity experts. The market needs a new way to solve this problem. If Gladius is successful, then the project will become the first ever decentralized Blockchain solution and defense from DDoS attacks."

Over the course of this meeting, we have accomplished a lot. We are pleased to say that we have finalized members for our VeChain Foundation Steering Committee; we have revolutionized our blockchain foundation governance system; we have discussed the evolution of the our blockchain design and functionalities and an exponentially upgraded economic model for all of our stakeholders. In celebration of the VeChain Foundation evolution, we have initiated a rebranding effort, or rather an escalation of our brand, which we will have finalized within a month and a half. More will be presented below. VeChain believes that a well governed foundation is the key to longevity, growth and stability. Making an actionable governance system, that matches the identity we envision for our product, is the base in which we built on for our apotheosis. As such, the governance model of VeChain Foundation was at the paramount of discussions. VeChain is going through an evolutionary period across all aspects of the foundation as directed by our Board of Steering Committee. At its core, the VeChain Foundation does not believe in a fully anarchically decentralization, nor does it believe in totalitarian governance. It is for that reason the board members envisioned something in between. Our governance structure is a new breed of a decentralized system through centralized channels, at its core it is a principal never seen before within the blockchain industry. [PICTURE ONE](URL Being the centralized agency to govern the decentralized workflows, VeChain is as strong as our Board of Steering Committee enables us to become. The Board of Steering Committee oversees the various functional committees within a decentralized foundation. The board members, though a governing agency, ultimately guide units towards cohesive goals and enables collaboration, efficiency, and output across channels that traditional org charts cannot. The Board of Steering Committee is the governing body of VeChain Foundation. It oversees the various functional committees within the foundation and represents the balanced interests of the VeChain blokchains stakeholders as a whole. Stakeholders include Blockchain Smart Contract Owners, VeChain Authority Nodes, and token holders. In addition, the Board of Steering Committee ensures the development, innovation, coordination and advancement of the VeChain blockchain ecosystem. Though not necessarily involved in day to day operational activities, the main functions include but not limited to the following: * Propose and organize blockchain-wide general voting; * Review and approve the Foundations fundamental strategies on technical, financial and business; * Review and approve the governance principle; * Review and approve the Foundations annual budget; * Review, approve and monitor the procedure of nomination and election of the Steering Committee members, functional committee chairs and the General Secretary of the Foundation. The Board of Steering Committee must be comprised of brilliant and respected individuals across a multitude of industries and it is for that reason we are very lucky to introduce our complete Board: **Name**|**Experience**|**Responsibility**| :--|:--|:--| CY Cheung|PwC Cybersecurity and Fintech Partner|Head of Regulation Committee| George Kang|CEO of Greater China Region, DNV GL Business Assurance|Head of Public Relation Committee| Jay Zhang|CFO, VeChain Co-founder|Head of Operational Committee| Margret Rui Zhu|Assistant Professor of City University of Hong Kong|Head of Compensation &amp;amp; Nomination Committee| Peter Zhou|Chief Scientist, VeChain Partner|Head of Technical Committee| Renato Grottola|Global Digital Transformation Director, DNV GL Business Assurance|In charge of VeChain business development related affairs| Sunny Lu|CEO, VeChain Co-founder|General Secretary of the Foundation| **C Y Cheung - PwC Cybersecurity and Fintech Partner** Chun Yin Cheung is a partner in PwC China's Risk Assurance Practice, based in the Shanghai office, having worked at PwC for over 14 years.

Each of the stakeholder holds at least 10,000 VeChain tokens with a single public key will be considered to have ONE vote, and each stakeholder can have not more than ONE vote. [PICTURE TWO](URL The following fundamental subjects will be voted by the stakeholders: - The election of new Board of Steering Committee; - The modification of fundamental consensus mechanism; - Other subjects that Board of Steering Committee deemed necessary for general voting. The general voting activities shall be carried in the VeChain Blockchain voting platform, designed to ensure anonymity, accuracy and not subject to manipulation. #VeChain Rebrand Our brand is not our name or logo, it is who we are. It is as much our governance model as it is our economic model. With VeChain undergoing its apotheosis it is imperative for our brand to grow with it. This evolution brings VeChain from a status of a blockchain solution to an one of a kind blockchain pioneer that can last indefinitely, offering a powerful and adaptable product for any business process that could benefit from trustless, immutable, and readily available data. This evolutional output requires us to reinvent the structure of our mainnet to coexist with an economic model design for indefinite stability and reward. As a result VeChain has become bigger, faster, stronger, disruptive, ambitious, incentivized and above all else, impactful. The board has made every effort to bring power to the stakeholders/people of VeChain. There are many attributes that make the Norse God Thor and VeChain similar, and therefore: VeChain is opting to upgrade the VeChain blockchain itself to VeChain Thor. The process of this transformation we call Apotheosis. Our efforts towards apotheosis will last over the course of a month and a half from today, the full range of details will be released periodically from now until the mid of January. Here is a glimpse at some of the changes being incorporated into VeChain Thor: * VeChain Blockchain will be upgraded to VeChain Thor Blockchain * Upon this release, we will be converting the existing VEN tokens for VeChain Thor tokens (VET). We are taking the appropriate measures to make this conversion seamless, we will begin this process by aiding current exchanges with the conversion first, all future exchanges will list our token as VET instead of VEN, including the ones we have been actively speaking to prior to this announcement of the name change. * Transactions on VeChain Thor Blockchain will not use VET token as expense. This is our way of giving back to the stakeholders. In turn the blockchain transactions will be incentivized through other reward structures. This allows VeChain to offer a stable and predictable budget for enterprise users. This new system also enables resource optimisation and adjustments by economical approaches for the indefinite future. * In order to take full advantage of decentralization and strong governance, the Foundation has decided to adopt Proof of Authority as the consensus mechanism of the VeChain Blockchain so that future developments are aligned with vision and direction the Foundation has designed; * As for Nodes and Masternodes, (Yes, we have them!) We categorize two major types of nodes on the VeChain Thor Blockchain, a total of four distinctive nodes all together: 1. One Authority Masternode 2. Three Economic Masternodes/Nodes ##VeChain Authority Masternode Thrudheim means World of Strength and is the home of Thor. We announce **Thrudheim Masternode** as the senior and most privileged masternodes that VET token holders can own. There will be a total **101** Thrudheim Masternodes on the VeChain Thor Network. Thrudheim Masternodes: * Receive the highest rewards of any node operators on VeChain Thor; * Hold the most power when it comes to voting rights * Are the most senior of masternodes that VET token holders can attain; * Stabilise the VeChain Thor blockchain network; * Are selected and rated based on the criteria the VeChain Foundation announce in the near future; To successfully become a Thrudheim Masternode Owner operating a Thrudheim Masternode, the token holder needs to fulfill certain criteria: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **A)** Owns a Qualified Thrudheim Masternode Candidate, the said candidate is a trackable address holding a minimum of 250,000 VET/VEN starting from Trust Tracking Day until the Date of Decision. Date of Decision will be announced soon, this date should coincide approximately with our main net launch date. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; **B)** The person who owns a Qualified Thrudheim Masternode Candidate is a Qualified Thrudheim Masternode Operator Applicant and will automatically enter into the application process, given he/she meets the below criteria: 1. Due to the importance of these Masternodes, and the limited number available, VeChain Foundation will need a period of time to observe and review each applicant to determine their trustworthiness and value proposition within the network, and the decision of acceptance will take into consideration of the holders contributions to the Foundation as whole, therefore, the Trust Tracking Day of the **Thrudheim Masternodes will start on December 21th**. More detailed information soon to be released on The Decision Making Criteria of Becoming a Thrudheim Masternode Holder. 2. The moment the token holding of Qualified Thrudheim Masternode Candidate is less than 250,000 VET, the address will lose the privilege of applying to become a Thrudheim Masternode when the blockchain launches. 3. Hardware conditions: CPU, hard disk capacity, memory, overall performance will be reviewed individually. 4. A full KYC and application procedure. VeChain Foundation will release a detailed Thrudheim Nodes selection standards, procedure and rewards together in a later announcement. #VeChain Economic Masternodes and Nodes: A VeChain Economic Masternode/Node offers stability to the ecosystem and acts as a distribution of power and privilege within the blockchains economy. VeChain Economic Masternodes/Nodes also have representation within the ecosystems voting periods. For an address with at least 10,000 VET/VEN held, a node represents one vote within the majority consensus. Unlike Authority Masternodes, Economic Masternodes/nodes do not produce blocks and ledger records. ###Mjolnir Masternodes Second highest-incentive Nodes) **Token possession:** 150,000 VET and above **Incentive received:** receive the highest reward among VeChain Economic Nodes. **Cannot be upgraded** More information on Mjolnir Masternodes soon ###Thunder Nodes (Higher-incentive Nodes) **Token possession:** 50,000 - 149,999 VET/VEN; **Incentive received:** receive the higher Thor incentive; **Can be upgraded;** More information on Thunder Nodes to come. ###Strength Nodes (Medium-incentive Nodes) **Token possession:** 10,000-49,999 VET/VEN; **Incentive received:** receive the medium Thor incentive, however, still more than none-node holders; **Can be upgraded;** More information on Strength Nodes to come. #####Holders with less than 10,000 VET tokens receive default incentive. #Important Timetable and planned events: * Hold corresponding quantity of VET/VEN tokens in a trackable wallet (such as MEW) starting from **00:00:00 UTC+8 on 21st December**; if your wallet has more than or equal to 250,000 VET/VEN, then you will be considered as an applicant to become a Thrudheim Masternode Operator, this is one of important must-have criteria when the Foundation selects Thrudheim Masternode Operators. * Any wallet holding a corresponding quantity of VEN/VET tokens for any other nodes begins to accumulate seniority and that will be used as a means of distributing incentives in the future. * An official strategic partnership announcement event is planned late January at London **between DNV GL and VeChain**. * A VeChain Rebranding event, in Singapore, is planned for mid-January. * A detailed economic model upon completion * Listing on a major exchange in December * A complete upgrade and rewrite of our current VeChain Development Plan (Not a Whitepaper Document) "
255,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Answers from VeChain AMA,51,7j8fnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7j8fnw/answers_from_vechain_ama/,2017-12-12 16:03:07,"&gt; ***Q1: How will the masternode system work, for example if i have 20k VEN/VET will i be able to split them into 2 nodes with 10k each or will it be 1 node with 20k? And ontop of that, will a node with 20k VEN/VET earn more than one with only 10k VEN/VET?*** A1: Firstly, the details of the economic nodes are not out yet, please wait for the details as we ramp up our Apotheosis efforts. We would still like to point out that you need to hold your VET off exchange in a wallet which we can track to be able to receive node rewards. m To answer your question: No, if you have 20K VET, it does not benefit more or less if you hold them in one wallet or split them into two wallets, the % reward will be the same, for it is still a Strength Node return. However, please note that the Nodes can be upgraded. Once the upgrade is completed from Strength Node to Thunder Node for example, you will be able to receive more rewards per VET held. &gt; ***Q2: Will there be big gaps between the different economic nodes? For example would there be a big difference between a Strength Node with 49 999 VEN/VET and a Thunder Node with 50 000 VEN/VET in terms of rewards?*** A2: We can not define what is Big Gaps at the moment, because the phrase is rather subjective. We would give out rewards calculation formulas when we are ready to release such details, so you can judge for yourself. Meanwhile, please pay attention to our official release. &gt; ***Q3: How much hardware/bandwidth/uptime will be needed to host the economic nodes? Will i be able to host them from a low budget computer with 100/100 Mbit/s internet for example? Also if you are able to host them from home, how much uptime is required, for example my net might go down like once every 2-3 months, would that cause any problems with hosting?*** A3: Except for The Ultimate Thrudheim Node, we currently do not specify a hardware requirement for our economic nodes, as in, the hardware running an economic node does not require high performing hardward. Again, please wait for more details. &gt; ***Q4: You say that nodes will be ""incentivized through other rewards structures"", any way you could elaborate on that (will it still be some kind of ""crypto payment"" aka NEO/GAS system)?*** A4: Please wait for our official release on details of our economic model. &gt; ***Q5: What kind of ROI % would you expect for each node tier (if its just based on tiers and not amount of VEN/VET in each tier also)?*** A5: We cannot say at this moment. Internally during these period of Apotheosis, this figure is changing almost on a daily basis given the intense discussions and current deals struck with our partners/potential partners. Even if we say something now, out of good faith, we might have to change it later, and that does not do well for our reputation. Therefore, we would like to state again, our Apotheosis process is a month and half, and all these detailed questions will be answered in the following releases coming until the end of the process. `Questions posted by [Figgeduni92](URL &gt; ***Q6: If VET won't be used for gas to run the blockchain, does this mean you will be creating a new currency used for gas?*** A6: VET will not be used to run the smart contracts and the specifics regarding the mechanism will be revealed in the upcoming economic model. We have announced that our rebranding process will take 1.5 months. It is within this time frame which we will be disclosing all of the economic model details. The reason why we have not released the whole thing at once is because there are some details that need to be fine-tuned. We are walking a fine line of balancing between the communities We want all the information TODAY! (so we release parts of the rebrand we know is correct for sure) vs. the Foundations We need to release the details when we are 100% sure, and because we are creating a Foundation that will hopefully be around for 100 years, we need to be sure every little detail is thought out. So, please wait for the release. We will not intentionally hold information from our community, what you see is what we are sure on. What you dont see are the things we are not 100% sure on, we assume the community would not want us to publish those unsure information . `Questions posted by [Imagine4D](URL &gt; ***Q7: The main question I think most of use are thinking is, will there be a token burn/buy back to reduce the total supply, as there is close to a billion tokens in total and only 300mil in circulation.*** &gt; &gt; ***I understand that this would inevitably push token prices up and masternode rewards would be reduced, but making the tokens more valuable and able to be fractionalised would surely be a benefit to your company/investors.*** A7: I think you raise a very good point about the negative effects of token burn. Pushing up token prices, making masternodes more difficult to acquire and in turn reducing the incentive of such masternodes goes against our philosophy that all users should benefit from our economic model. A token burn in the future would be a mistake as we need tokens to facilitate business development. Additionally we prefer to go the route of masternodes that directly incentivize holders. This is much healthier for VeChains ecosystem and provides more flexibility for all users. We decided to burn the refunded tokens in Sep/Oct following Chinese regulations and compliance measures. We believe its most fair action for everyone especially to those people who decided to stand with us at that time. The valuation of VET will have two different supports: 1. VET represents the right to use the public infrastructure of VeChain Thor. More VET you have, more you can use VeChain which means more value you can create out of usage. 2. VET represents the GDP running in VeChain Thor as the role of Smart Money to speed up the value transfer in the mirrored business activities running in VeChain Thor. `Questions posted by [coronstein](URL &gt; ***Q8: Is there any reason a luxury brand wouldn't want to do something like this?*** A8: We can not think of a legitimate reason why a luxury brand wont do this. It is a way to really put a dent on the counterfeit products in turn secures the brands revenue from products theyve created. &gt; ***Q9: If I buy a handbag, would the shop add the sale to the product's history? Would the product's record say that it belongs to me specifically?*** A9: For the first part of your question, the answer is YES. Once the product is sold, the relevant sale information will be added and recorded on VeChain Thor Blockchain. This also means, the product starts a new journey with you. In VeChain app, there is a function to claim the ownership of an object. You can upload pictures or stories to VeChain Thor and share your unique interaction experience with the product you purchased. Nevertheless, the service of digital ownership will be up to each brand but we believe no brand would say No to such awesome and innovative offerings to their clients. &gt; ***Q10: In the case of a car, do you envision RFID / NFC on multiple places (Airbags, engine, chassis, etc...), all being scanned during each maintenance procedure, or one single RFID on the car that gets all the maintenance info added to it each time... or multiple RFIDs, one on the chassis that is updated all the time, one on the engine, and then you scan them both if you remove the engine from the car, and the future owner of the engine can check the past history... It seems like a great system, though I worry that if you forget to scan maintenance in, the value of the car would drop even if you did the maintenance (obviously, this happens already, but perhaps the difference would be greater with the possibility of airtight maintenance records. For exotic cars, Bugatti, Ferrari, etc., the idea of blockchain records is enormously appealing.*** A10: RFID is not necessary in the auto mobile case. Each vehicle has an unique chassis number on the VeChain Thor Blockchain. The VID is the unique identification of each vehicle. Key components such as the engine, brake master cylinder, starter motor, etc., will have unique IDs too, which are associated with the VID of the vehicle. In the case of replacement of key components, the new component ID will be associated with VID, and relevant data will be updated and recorded on the blockchain. Regarding the scenario you mentioned in the question, it's unlikely to happen as keeping maintenance records is the most important step, this can ensure all key components related maintenance records can be stored and protected on VeChain Thor Blockchain. &gt; ***Q11: Besides helping to raise funds for your team, what role does VEN / VET have in the process ? If you could help me visualize the role VEN / VET plays in this product-tracking ecosystem, I'd be much obliged.*** A11: Generally speaking, the valuation of VET will have two different supports: 1. VET represents the right to use the public infrastructure of VeChain Thor. More VET you have, more you can use VeChain which means more value you can create out of usage. 2. VET represents the GDP running in VeChain Thor as the role of Smart Money to speed up the value transfer in the mirrored business activities running in VeChain Thor. VET will have tremendous amount of usage within the VeChain ecosystem. More information will be available shortly as the full release of our economic model is released. `Questions posted by [Supermoon26](URL &gt; ***Q12: How will VeChain be able to set stable prices for their goods and services?*** A12: As we mentioned in our last release, transactions on VeChain Thor Blockchain will not use VET token as expense. This design allows VeChain to offer a stable and predictable budget for enterprise users. This new system also enables resource optimisation and adjustments by economical approaches for the indefinite future. &gt; ***Q13: What is the value in releasing VEN/VET to open markets instead of VeChain controlling the supply and all nodes?*** A13: We intent to setup the high level structure of a foundation and a thriving blockchain community by introducing a series of innovations, including Steering Commnittee, our economic model. We believe what we are building is very large in scale and will last for many years to come. It is impossible for us to imagine a single entity can support the health and security of something of this magnitude. We have yet to see any entity or organization in the world currently is capable of supportin what we are trying to build. A healthy market dynamic should enable VeChain to stand up against any emerging competitor as the market is dictating what appropriate values should be. It is for that reason we introduced the concept of Thor. And we are thrilled about the economic model we are going to release soon.. Its innovative and inspiring to reach a certain balance with a certain level of open markets and a certain level of governance. `Questions posted by [dachshundmania](URL &gt; ***Q14: I'd like to know how advanced the partnership with KUEHNE + NAGEL is. Any real implementation for VeChain coming soon in this area? Apart from wine and luxury goods, are we going to see VeChain being implemented in logistics and industry anytime soon?*** A14: Actually, K&amp;N was the first batch of enterprise users for the current VeChain for logistics management. We are impressed and appreciated about the adventurous spirit of such big company like K&amp;N. The project has been alive for almost one year now which supports very important customer of K&amp;N for logistics management and assets tracking. We have been encouraged by this project, and with an in-depth cooperation with DNV GL, industries such as cold-chain logistics and medical instruments tracking are active collaboration areas for VeChain to begin exploring. `Questions posted by [David_manuel](URL &gt; ***Q15: As a masternode, do you have to be connected to the internet/blockchain 24/7 with your wallet/pc/notebook/ledger to validate transactions and receive rewards?*** A15: Two answers. 1) You do not have to be connected to the internet/blockchain 24/7 to be considered to have a Masternode status, down time is allowed. 2) Yes, you would have to be connected to be able to validate transactions and receive rewards. Otherwise, youve be considered offline. Although, we will not recommend nodes running in a unprofessional way especially masternodes. They will be expected to be running either for the integrity and safety of VeChain Blockchain networks or smart contract deployment and executions which requires not only a certain level of environment including hardware and software but also the appropriate security compliances. We have been working with independent third party cyber security team for the details which will be released before the mainnet upgrades go-live for sure. &gt; ***Q16: How often do you receive your Masternode reward?*** Can you split for example 20.000 VET to hold 2 Strength Nodes? Is there any advantage in having two Masterodes compared to one Masternode with 20.000VET? I guess the Masternodes simply set a percentage dividend on all held VETs. So you shouldn't have any advantage from splitting. A16: You can split your VET however you please amongst nodes as long as you meet the requirements for them. As for the specifics of the incentive mechanism you will have to wait till the economic model is released. `Questions posted by Siota` &gt; ***Q17: What was the extent of your work with Microsoft? Are you guys still talking? Will there be any future collaborations with Microsoft***? A17: Partnering with Microsoft has been a rewarding opportunity and lead to the PoC for Renault's digital maintenance book and green driving solutions. Renault expressed positive feedback on the joint work between Microsoft, VISEO, and VeChain in regards to this PoC and we are in ongoing discussions about the implementation of our efforts. Actually, VeChain is running the demo in MTC (Microsoft Technical Center) in Paris. We value both Microsoft and VISEO as partners both now and in the future. You can find the following link for more details about this project released by Microsoft France although its in French: &lt;URL `Questions posted by [Imagine4D](URL &gt; ***Q18: Is the official partnership event to outline the exact details of your partnership with DNV GL and VeChain, or can we expect more?*** A18: The event will hightlight 3 items: Firstly, the Exact details of our partnership Secondly, the implication of the partnership for VeChain Foundation and DNV GL clients And thirdly, the significance of this partnership for VeChain and DNV GL clients, and even to some degree, the standard of assurance companies globally. &gt; ***Q19: Will economic transparency still occur when you start selling to corporate partners?*** A19: VeChain foundation will keep running in a transparent way as NGO and Blockchain platform organizations. At the same time, we will also need to protect the confidentiality of our corporate partners base on each agreement. &gt; ***Q20: Are there any specific markets you are currently targeting right now?*** A20: The use cases of VeChain are massive, and as such, so are the potential markets. The team deals with the ever growing resource constraints; our short-term focus includes luxury/fashion, logistics/cold chain logistics, supply chain management, medical instruments tracking, and automobile as targeted industries. As the power of VeChain becomes more evident, so will our markets reach with more and more partners. We are and will be focus on what we are good at and let the partners to be innovative to create valuable applications in their territory. `Questions posted by [Bad_dota_playa](URL &gt; ***Q21: Has PwC introduced your solution to their clients and is VeChain as a result speaking with new partners?*** A21: We are beyond satisfied with our working relationship with PwC. Not only have they been an avid voice for VeChain within their network, but are actively partnering with us on the development of the product. Their commitment to VeChain has been invaluable in helping us expand our potential clientele. As a VET token holder, please keep in mind the time it takes to finalize new projects. It is not as straightforward as announcing details; you must anticipate ample time to create a project proposal, PoC implementation, testing, and all the business processes in between concerning new partnerships. As projects are ready to go-live, we will gladly share the news with our community. &gt; ***Q22: Will VeChain receive additional capital (fiat only) from third party investors?*** A22: The VeChain Foundation is a non-profit organization, so we dont accept additional capital investment but donations will be more than welcome. &gt; ***Q23: Could you please elaborate on a few compliance regulations that would apply to VeChain and how you will address these to ensure an actual real world implementation of your product?*** A23: Compliance/regulations such as GDPR in Europe, Cybersecurity law in China, and other relevant requirements in the USA, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore are mainly considered by the team when implementing our solutions. Hence we involved CY Cheung, senior partner from PwC, as one of steering committee memebers of VeChain, to lead identifying the key risks during our implementation to ensure the legality. &gt; ***Q24: What is the proudest moment of the VeChain team of the past year and what is the team looking most forward to in Q1 2018?*** A24: If you asked me yesterday the answer would be different from today. VeChain as a concept is immense and as we introduce our product, our understanding of the scope of this project continues to grow. I am proud to be apart of this ever-growing vision. Understanding what you'd want to hear, as a VET token holder, however, I would be the most impressed by the work that has come out of our first Board of Steering Committee meeting in which you see the fruits of through Apotheosis. `Questions posted by rookert42` &gt; ***Q25: Thanks for doing this AMA!

As even Amazon services don't guarantee 100%.*** A27: Our masternode system is extremely inclusive, meaning that there will be many nodes to ensure the integrity and security of the network. This sheer number means that, 100% uptime for individual nodes is not necessary to maintain system. `Questions posted by [StrengthCapped](URL &gt; ***Q28: You have stated that you have a partnership with DNV GL. DNV on their part has recently transferred all of their assurance certificates to a private blockchain in cooperation with Deloitte.*** &gt; &gt; ***What is the scope of your partnership with DNV GL, and have you been in any way been involved in development of the blockchain solution offered by Deloitte?*** A28: Over 150 years, DNV GL has provided trust services. To build and provide Digital Trust in the age of digital transformation, DNV GL decided to adopt VeChain blockchain technology to offer transparent, immutable, decentralized digital business assurance services. With the recent brand upgrade, The new VeChain Thor platform enables powerful and adaptable digital trust services, as a result, VeChain has become bigger, faster, stronger, more trustworthy, more disruptive, more ambitious, more incentivized and above all else, more impactful. DNV GL will announce our partnership at London in late January, and we are excited to start the journey with DNV GL.

256,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,PALM BEACH GROUP (pbc) text copied to pastebin.,10,77hel9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/77hel9/palm_beach_group_pbc_text_copied_to_pastebin/,2017-10-20 08:11:07,"Palm Beach Confidential Three Ex-Government Agents Just Created the Ultimate Privacy Coin Heres How Well Make 7,000% Gains Over the Next 1224 Months Buying It By Teeka Tiwari on October 19, 2017 In February 2017, I wrote to you about a tiny Chinese crypto project then valued at just $5 million. Just a year earlier in 2016, the projects value was $25 million. That meant the coin had shed 80% of its value. At the time, it was a difficult decision to recommend it. The chart looked ugly. But the idea was compelling. My research convinced me the coin had long-term value. When I recommended it, I told you I thought it would become Chinas preeminent blockchain development tool. I said you could make 100 times your money on it. And so, we bought it at 13 cents. Eight days after recommending this crypto, the price collapsed to 8 cents. Its total market cap slumped to just $3 million. To anyone looking at just the price, it looked like a disaster. I never did find out what was behind that drop. But I am forever grateful to the shortsighted people who sold their coins to my subscribers for pennies. Just six months later, Neo (then Antshares) rose 60,760% from its lows. It would go on to hit a high of $50. That was a gain of 41,605% for Palm Beach Confidential readers who bought in at 13 cents. This month, Ive found a similar situation to Neo before it shot up. Earlier this year, the coin was trading as much as 170% higher. Its up off its lows but the trading is still lackluster. Volume and sentiment is low. And just like my original recommendation of Neo, the market cap is tiny at just $16 million. On top of all of that, the price chart looks ugly. But just like Neo, this idea is compelling. And my B.I.T.S. system is screaming buy (more on that below). A Big Announcement A dream team of ex-government agents have come together to create what I believe will become the worlds most widely used privacy coin. But its more than that. Its a full-blown privacy platform. The platform allows for globally secure payments with built-in anonymous messaging. You can also publish documents and store data anonymously. And developers can use the platform to build and launch their own privacy apps. Outside a small number of people, this coin is virtually unknown. But over the last six months, some of the brightest minds in crypto have been quietly rallying around this project. Charles Hoskinson is the former CEO of Ethereum. Hes a close advisor of the project. And he has a team of developers working on it right now. The main core technical team developer is the same guy who leads the payments engineering team at the $31 billion vacation rental behemoth Airbnb. The project has attracted a fierce following of developers and community members that number over 1,000. In the next few weeks, the project is about to make a big announcement. The announcement will make this privacy coin the most secure network in the world. More secure than current leaders Monero, Zcash, and Dash. When this announcement is made, investor money will flood into the coin. We want to own this before that announcement is made. (More on that below.) Short term, I think well see this one double over the next few weeks. Within one to two years, I expect this coin to have a $1 billion to $2 billion market cap. That would take the price from around $7 per coin to between $250 and $500 per coin. That would turn a $400 investment into $14,30028,500. Or a $1,000 investment into $35,70071,400. At Palm Beach Confidential, we call this asymmetric-risk investing. Its the strategy we use to take a trivial sum of money and convert it into life-changing wealth. Thousands of my subscribers have already done this. If you are new to Confidential, welcome. Its your turn to get a crack at a 50-bagger. I want you to remember that just like Neo, this idea will be wildly volatile. We might double in price right out of the gate. We could just as easily drop 50% next week. And Ill tell you it doesnt matter When you take a small position size, you can safely ignore volatility and focus on the big picture. And the big picture for this idea and its future are bright. Be sure to check out the resources were constantly adding to our Crypto Corner. If you have questions about anything cryptocurrencies, chances are youll find the answers there. There, you can access our research on web-based wallets, hardware wallets, and other cryptocurrency services. The Dream Team: Mercenary Mathematician, Nuclear Sub Officer, NASA Hacker This idea was born from the meeting of three ex-military guys who wanted to create a more secure, anonymous version of bitcoin. To do that, they combined their expertise in the military, intelligence, and cryptography fields. In his own words, project leader Rob Viglione is a mercenary mathematician. Hes a former U.S. Air Force officer with experience in satellite radar, space launch vehicles, and combat support intelligence. He also was a private U.S. military contractor embedded in Afghanistan. There, he used mathematical algorithms to map out the likely locations of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Rolf Versluis is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. After graduation, he was commissioned as an officer of a nuclear submarine. Joshua Yabut is a former cybersecurity expert at NASA and former National Guard executive officer. His job was to break into government and corporate networks. By all accounts, he was excellent at it. A year ago, these three men joined forces. They saw a world becoming increasingly hostile to individual freedoms and decided to do something about it. They want to give people back control over their privacy. Heres what they wrote in their white paper for the project: We live in a hyper-regulated and surveilled world where billions of individuals are deprived of basic human rights, such as property ownership, privacy, free association, and access to information. The technology now exists to solve some of these problems These three men come from a unique background in government. No one Ive met in the crypto space has a better understanding of the governments security apparatus than they do. They understand nation-led security threats at a deeper level than any other privacy coin team in the world. Thats why instead of just building another privacy coin, they built an entire privacy ecosystem. Your Privacy is Under Assault Everywhere we look, our privacy is under attack. In an increasingly online world, governments can see what we read, with whom we talk, and what we do with our money. Take Turkey, for instance. That countrys government has jailed people for downloading certain apps. In 2016, a military coup tried to topple the government. The plotters used a smartphone messaging app called ByLock to coordinate the attack. In retaliation, the Turkish government jailed nearly 75,000 citizens for downloading the app. Even if they had nothing to do with the coup. Think about that. And dont think this is just something that happens abroad. Your privacy is under assault in the United States, too. According to former FBI director James Comey, you have no right to privacy at all. There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America; there is no place outside of judicial reach, Comey said at a Boston College conference on cybersecurity back in March. Apparently, in the eyes of the FBI, no corner of your life is sacred. It can look at it all. Thats why it should have been no surprise when we discovered the National Security Agency (NSA) has been monitoring all of our communication for years. But it doesnt stop there. Governments also want complete oversight of our personal wealth. Heres why In the West, governments are drowning in debts they cant pay back. The only answer is to assault our wealth with new taxes. But you cant tax what you cant see. And thats one of the reasons many governments fear cryptocurrencies. Unlike fiat currencies, governments cant easily steal cryptocurrencies when a crisis hits. Thats what European Union member Cyprus did during its banking crisis in 2013. The government confiscated up to 30% of its depositors money in some cases. With cryptocurrencies, you control your own private key. That means no one can take your wealth from you. Governments hate this. Its not just national governments targeting citizens wealth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization with 189 country members. In 2013, it proposed a global 10% wealth tax on all citizens with a positive net worth. As governments struggle to bridge funding gaps, we expect more and more outrageous attempts to seize your wealth. Long story short: The world is becoming a smaller, less private place. Whether its the NSA listening in on all our calls, or the Turkish government cracking down on privacy apps, or the IMF trying to tax your wealth, governments are trampling over citizens rights. This has led to the rise of privacy coins. Privacy coins are cryptocurrencies that seek to hide your identity. They are designed so governments cant track how much you have or what you buy. When I first started looking at privacy coins a year ago, the entire market was under $200 million. Today, it stands at over $4 billion. Thats a 1,900% increase. Two of the top 10 most valuable cryptocurrencies are privacy coins Monero and Dash. We own both and have done quite well. As of this writing. were up 923% and 111%, respectively. But as good as Dash and Monero are at protecting privacy, they focus on small niches. In my research, Ive found only one project that provides a much broader level of privacy that the future will demand. A New Way to Shield Transactions The name of this project is ZenCash (ZEN). ZenCash has about 2.2 million coins outstanding. Just like bitcoin, there will never be more than 21 million ZenCash coins. Heres the background on ZenCash ZenCash shares a similar history to the $2.2 billion privacy coin giant Dash. (Dash is currently the sixth largest cryptocurrency in the world.) What many folks dont know is that Dash went through a long, winding road before becoming the powerhouse it is today. Dash started as a clone of bitcoin but with privacy. Its original name was Darkcoin. It then forked (spun off) into XCoin, and then forked again into Dash. Each change brought further refinements to the underlying protocol. Weve seen ZenCash follow a similar path. ZenCash started as a clone of Zcash. Zcash was the first cryptocurrency to use a form of cryptography called zk-snarks. A detailed explanation of zk-snarks is beyond the scope of this report. The bottom line with this technology is that it allows for something called shielded transactions. A shielded transaction hides the identity of the sender, the receiver, and the transaction amount. Zcash is a brilliant project, but it has problems. One of the biggest is how the mining reward is set up. For the first four years of Zcashs existence, 20% of the mining reward went to its original development team. This didnt sit well with certain developers. So, they forked Zcash and created a new coin called Zclassic. Zclassic stripped out the founders reward and gave miners 100% of the mining fees. Scrapping the founders reward was a step in the right direction but it didnt go far enough. Zclassic still had a fundamental weakness It was dependent on the goodwill of the community to keep developing it. It had no funds of its own to ensure constant development and improvement. Thats when Rob Viglione, Rolf Versluis, and Joshua Yabut decided to fork Zclassic and create a better version: ZenCash. In a moment, Ill explain to you the changes the team made that will make ZenCash the No. 1 privacy coin in the world. Before I do that, I want to show you whats wrong with the privacy coins we have right now. The Four Problems With Current Privacy Coins The worlds privacy coins are each solving small parts of the overall privacy problem. Zcash wants to keep your transactions and wealth secret.Dash wants to be a commerce coin with optional privacy.Monero wants to be untraceable digital cash. Each of these coins has done great work in its relative niche but each has fundamental drawbacks. Drawback No. 1: Inadequate Funding Model Moneros funding model relies on developers donating their time to the project. They are not paid to improve Monero. Perhaps thats why there still isnt a user-friendly mobile wallet. Zcashs funding model is only in place for the first four years. After that, Zcash is expected to rely on the community for further development. Only Dash has truly sustainable long-term development funding through its treasury model. Dashs design sends 10% of the mining reward into a treasury to pay for ongoing development. For long-term success, a privacy coin must have a self-funding model. Drawback No. 2: Not Fully Secure Privacy coins arent as anonymous as advertised. To our knowledge, no cryptocurrency today employs end-to-end encryption. End-to-end encryption is a system of communication. In this system, only communicating users can read the messages they send and receive. No eavesdropper can access the messages. Without end-to-end encryption, anyone monitoring the network could see all traffic across all blockchains. This means governments could track down the origin of transactions and identify users. Here are two examples of so-called untraceable coins getting traced In 2016, federal law enforcement agents seized nearly 12,000 Monero coins. And this year, law enforcement agents seized nearly 3,700 Zcash coins from the late Alexandre Cazes, the alleged leader of dark market drug purveyor AlphaBay. Obviously, the government did not publicize how it was able to track down these untraceable coins. But it makes sense that the lack of end-to-end encryption could have played a role in unmasking these transactions. While you and I have no interest in running an illegal drug bazaar, there are many legitimate reasons to want privacy. For instance, do you want everyone to know exactly what you buy or what causes you support? The government has a history of persecution based on political beliefs. In 2013, news broke that the IRS had targeted organizations affiliated with the Tea Party. Lets say you want to give money to WikiLeaks, a website that publishes secrets and classified information from anonymous sources. If you donate publicly, the government could use that information to deny you a security clearance or federal job. Even private sector jobs could discriminate against you. What if you want to give money to a pro-life or a pro-choice charity? Either choice could lead to employer and/or social discrimination. The point is there are lots of legitimate reasons to keep your financial transactions secret. Without end-to-end encryption, you cant be sure you are safe. Drawback No. 3: Easily Blocked As governments become more fearful of cryptocurrencies, theyll try to block your access to them. Were already seeing this in China and Russia. China has shut down its domestic crypto exchanges. The Russian central bank has said it will block access to all cryptocurrency trading websites. Governments will enforce these bans by making Internet Service Providers (ISPs) keep a list of banned sites. You literally will not be able to connect to these sites. Dash, Monero, and Zcash have no way to overcome this type of government blocking. This is a huge flaw in todays leading privacy coins. Drawback No. 4: They Only Handle Payments Dash, Monero, and Zcash are primarily designed to handle the transfer of money. Zcash offers something slightly different with its private messaging function. Dash also has unique offerings like instant send, which allows you to receive money instantly. The privacy coin of the future must be able to do more than move money. It must have built-in messaging.It must allow anonymous data publishing and storage.It must have end-to-end encryption and be unblockable.And of course, it must be able to handle the anonymous transfer of money. None of the current privacy coin leaders have all of those functions except ZenCash. Why ZenCash Will Become the Most Widely Used Privacy Coin Earlier, I told you ZenCash is the brainchild of three ex-military men. This is important because if you believe in the saying it takes a thief to catch a thief, then youll understand the value these military insiders bring to a privacy ecosystem. Throughout their careers, these founders have had ringside seats to how governments really operate. Thats why they shed their government careers and devoted their professional lives to the creation of a total privacy platform. The ZenCash team has designed a platform that will plug the holes that plague the current privacy coins. Plug No. 1: Robust Funding Model Developing software costs money lots of money. Traditional software firms rely on issuing stock, sometimes bonds, and on rare occasions, actual earnings to fund their operations. Typically, cryptocurrency projects rely on community donations of time and skill. Relying on the goodwill of others is not a long-term scalable solution. The other problem with relying on a community of developers is that a small group of folks ends up steering the project. This results in a centralized development team, which can lead to a weaker project. We like decentralized development teams. In that model, the community votes on which aspects of development get priority. When you have a funding mechanism that the community votes on, it ensures the best ideas and the most committed developers are getting the money they need to keep improving the project. ZenCash has solved this problem by using a Treasury Model. Every 2.5 minutes, 12.5 ZenCash gets mined. Under its Treasury Model, 88% of the mining reward goes to the miners. The ZenCash Foundation Treasury gets 8.5%. (Ill explain where the rest goes in a moment.) Right now, 7,200 new ZenCash gets mined each day. Of that, 612 coins (8.5%) go to the ZenCash Foundation Treasury. At current prices, thats $4,284 per day or $1,563,600 each year. Now, remember: ZenCash is only at $7 right now. As the price starts rising, well see the treasury allocation rise along with it. This model ensures that ZenCash will have a steady supply of capital to pay for its ongoing development without having to engage in dilutive coin offerings. This funding model means ZenCash will always have the money needed to keep growing and improving. Plug No. 2: End-to-End Encryption Earlier, I mentioned that ZenCash is on the cusp of a major announcement that will bring in a flood of new investors. It has to do with end-to-end encryption. As of this writing, there is not a single cryptocurrency that offers end-to-end encryption. ZenCash is about to fix that with a solution it calls secured nodes. According to the white paper, secured nodes ensure the system remains distributed, resilient, and secure. By enforcing encrypted communication between nodes, and between nodes and wallets, Zen protects against eavesdropping [] As I mentioned earlier, end-to-end encryption helps thwart government efforts at linking network traffic to users identities. As regimes such as China and Russias become more hostile to cryptocurrencies, this service will become a must-have option. The secured node network is being beta-tested right now. It will go live in two to four weeks. Right now, there are 170 test secure nodes. The founders estimate they will have 1,000 secured nodes by the end of the first quarter of 2018. They expect such rapid growth because anyone operating a secured node will be entitled a share in 3.5% of the mining reward. We think this is a very smart way of ensuring the ZenCash network stays highly distributed and secure. Plug No. 3: Domain Fronting As I write this, Russias central bank has announced it will block its citizens from accessing cryptocurrency websites. As already mentioned, China has shut down its domestic cryptocurrency trading platforms. The founders of ZenCash have long known this day would come. Thats why they built domain fronting into ZenCash. With domain fronting, you can make a domain (website) youre trying to access look like something else. For instance, if you are in Russia and want to access a ZenCash wallet, domain fronting would make your network request look like you were going to an approved website. Heres another way to think about domain fronting Its like having a plane ticket that says you are flying to London. This lets you pass the security checkpoint. Except once youve passed security, the ticket changes and lets you fly to Cuba without anyone knowing. ZenCash is the only privacy coin we know of that will have domain-fronting capability. As more governments become hostile to cryptocurrencies, this is another feature that will be critical to a privacy coins success. Thats why we expect the global demand for domain fronting to soar, and ZenCash along with it Again, as of this writing, ZenCash is the only privacy coin that offers domain fronting. Plug No. 4: Full Privacy Platform ZenCash is more than just a way to send and receive money anonymously. It is a full privacy platform that other developers can build upon. So instead of having to build your own privacy platform from scratch, you can build applications on top of the ZenCash system. Here are some of the different applications youll see launch on the ZenCash platform. ZenTalk is a secure communications network that allows you to broadcast a message from one person to many people. Think of it like an encrypted invitation-only Twitter feed.ZenPub is a platform that will let you publish and store documents anonymously.ZenHide is the domain fronting service. ZenHide will give users the ability to circumnavigate crypto-commerce blocking. On top of all that, ZenCash includes the ability to send and receive money anonymously (or publicly if you wish). Plus, you can use it as a one-to-one private messaging system. In addition, ZenCash can work with other blockchains (that means its interoperable). Lets say you want to set up an Ethereum smart contract but handle the payment via a ZenCash shielded address. In the future, youll be able to do that. This rich set of features makes ZenCash more than just a privacy coin. Its a privacy platform and platforms are incredibly valuable. This is because platforms attract other developers. And more developers equate to more apps, which equate to more users. More users equal more demand for ZenCash, and that, my friends, equals much higher prices ahead. URL"

The team is building a decentralized bandwidth marketplace using dApps on Ethereum. The plan is to allow developers to build any kind of bandwidth application on Privatix. Users can sell their unused bandwidth to these applications, and the applications' users will essentially be buying the bandwidth. As a way to drive adoption, Privatix will build their own proof-of-concept applications on the network first, and they're starting out with a VPN. Future plans include proxies and CDNs. These proof-of-concept applications will kickstart the market and as more applications are built on Privatix, there will be more and more demand for bandwidth. Team is really strong and has a good deal of experience with VPNs and cybersecurity in general. They have built and are currently running popular VPNs and secure email services with hundreds of thousands of users. I'm quite excited about the project, but obviously I'm biased because I work closely with the team. I highly recommend checking out the project here yourself: URL"

This is why I purchased Rivetz tokens.* **What is Rivetz?** The Problem: Cybersecurity has failed to keep pace with evolving threats caused by the increasing use of mobile devices, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT and cloud computing. During the next five years, cyber-crime might become the greatest threat to every person, place and thing in the world. Cybersecurity Ventures anticipates that cybersecurity damages will total more than $6 trillion globally, up from $3 trillion in 2015. Estimates peg the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices to exceed 200 billion by 2020. The Solution: Rivetz is building a Global Attestation and Identity Network, powered by the Rivetz Token (RvT), in order to improve the security of our mobile devices. The goal is to provide a platform and tools to simplify a developers access to the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), a dedicated and impenetrable hardware platform that exists in every device. With Rivetz, a known device has a special secret key hidden from hackers in the TEE that gives your device permission to sign into your services. Rivetz uses the RvT token and blockchain to cryptographically prove that the vault in your phone is secure, all the way from the manufacturer to your pocket essentially enabling every mobile wallet to have the same level of security as a hardware wallet like the Ledger. **Team and history** Rivetz has been building this technical foundations for 3 years. Rivetz is a first-mover with patent pending cybersecurity services and capabilities that leverage the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Currently, there are no other competitors in this space. Steven is one of the principle industry evangelists for the application of trusted computing technology. Steven served as President and CEO for 14 years at Wave Systems, a security software company, so he has experience running a multi-million dollar company. The team has approx. 11 members. Notable advisors include a Board member from Factom and Gavin Wood, founder and former CTO of Ethereum, and founder of Parity Technologies. **Use of the tokens** The token is a utility ERC20 token and is used for:  Tokens are expected to be exchanged for Cybercontrol services. Rivetz builds a couple and we have partners building a couple; the APIs will be published for anyone to explore.  Tokens will be used to register reference health measurements.  Tokens will be used to verify the integrity of the device with the cybersecurity controller.  Tokens will be consumed to provide a machine multisig. Use case for Rivetz are IoT, Cloud Authentication and Access, Machine Automated Money with Policy, Cybersecurity Controls for Smart Contracts and Blockchain. **Strategic Partnerships** **Trustonic** Trustonic has already been deployed by manufacturers on 1 billion devices over the last 4 years, so there should be an installed base in the 500-700 Million units. Samsung, HTC, LG, Xiaomi, Miezu, ZTE, SONY, Kyocera, already deliver devices that will run the Rivetz trusted app. No hardware needs to be added! The TEE was added years ago by ARM, the company that does the architecture for all other chips in all phones. (Whitepaper) URL **TELEFONICA BUSINESS SOLUTIONS** Telefonica is a global company with 346 million customers in 45 countries with revenue of approx. 52 billion EURO URL **US Government Contracts** In Q1 2017 the company was awarded a US Government contract and in Q2 it was further awarded an SBIR contract by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology (S&amp;T) directorate. Whitepaper pg.6 **Factom Inc.** Rivetz, and Factom announced that Factom has selected Rivetz to integrate world cyber-security for the Factom applications URL **Parity** The companies' agreement signals a commitment to developing increased security standards within blockchain transactions, building a broader sense of confidence in blockchain networks and services. URL **National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence** Announced it has been selected by the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), part of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), to collaborate on its Multifactor Authentication for e-Commerce project. URL Other smaller partnerships include LAToken, Touch Titans, Paypie, and myGEOTracking **Roadmap** Developer tools and the Rivetz 2 FA capability are expected to be delivered in the fall, and a machine multisig by the end of the year. **Value Proposition** The ICO was slated to sell 70 million tokens, however, I believe due to a combination of limited marketing and the complexity of the technology (I had to read the whitepaper 3 times to understand just the basic technology behind it), approximately only ~22 million tokens were sold. The ICO price was ~$0.85 and the current price is well below that due to the low volume. The CEO estimated that the circulating supply is under 30 million and with a price of $0.55 as of this writing, the market cap would be about **~16 million** so theres a ton of room for growth. The total market cap has yet to be updated in CMC as they are still going through the bounties. The token is currently only available on limited exchanges (ED and HitBTC) but the Company have mentioned in the Telegram channel that they are currently working with several major exchanges. To summarize, I think Rivetz is a great investment due to: 1. The Company has been working on this technology for 3 years 2. Is ran by a team that dedicated 14 years into running software security company 3. Massive real-world potential with currently no competition 4. Unknown at the moment and extremely undervalued in the crypto space 5. Has an impressive list of partnerships As always, do your own research and best of luck. "
259,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,New ICO Project for White Hat Hackers. Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Research Have Never Been So Easy,20,75vj5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/75vj5x/new_ico_project_for_white_hat_hackers_penetration/,2017-10-12 18:55:53,"The world of today is developing incredibly fast. The variety of new technologies and processes have advanced in different regions of the world on a regular basis. Theyre from different fields and industries and serve unique purposes. However, innovations have one thing in common - all of them need safety of personal information and program code. If this requirement is violated, no company would be able to survive. Cyber Security Market Advancements The role of cyber security market has become extremely important under these circumstances. Its played a role of the most crucial industry and works as infrastructure for all other businesses. In turn, the internal development of the market has never been more expected. Everyone knows the proverb - New Times Call for New Measures. Meet Hacken - the first platform and cryptocurrency of the same name, which is custom-tailored to satisfy the needs of the cyber security market. The main characteristics of it are decentralization, liquidity, and anonymity thanks to the application of the best suited technology for these purposes - blockchain. Within the offered functions, this technology would assist the company in coping with all the challenges of the industry. It would help achieve the highest level of security for a startup and assist the white hat hackers in their desire to work in an ethical key by providing high compensation and total anonymity for them. The cyber security market would obviously benefit from the application of blockchain technology, especially accounting for the fact that the cryptocurrency would be created taking into consideration all the peculiarities and needs of the market. Hacken Influence on the Market The creation of Hacken framed a priority goal for the company and industry in general. The company aims to contribute to the development of the cyber-security market and promote the idea of being a white hat hacker. To ensure the achievement of this noble goal, the company designed some products, which are integrated within the Hacken ecosystem. Hacken Proof The first component to assure the implementation of the cyber security market changes and improvements is the Hacken Proof platform. It will offer white hat hackers a range of projects so that theyll be able to participate in vulnerability and penetration testing of various companies. The competitive advantage of this bug bounty platform would be total anonymity. Neither customers nor clients would be able to reach each other or harm in any means. All the operations on the platform would be delivered in exchange for HKNs only, which would help frame the industry and its future growth. More information about the policies and participation prospects are available via this link URL Hacken Accelerator However, the single company would not be able to frame and achieve all the goals, stated above. Thats the main reason why Hacken is willing to create another product, the Hacken Accelerator. This would be the place where the best initiatives in the cyber security field are to be supported by Hacken and its marketing team. The first participants would be announced during the Annual HackIT conference, which would be assessed below. Its also noteworthy that all the operations and funds of the Hacken Accelerator would also be in HKNs. As a result, young and bright talent will be able to bring their ideas to fruition regardless of any stiff competition and a lack of funds. HackIT Conference The support of the market by searching for and preparing the best professionals of cybersecurity is also a top priority for Hacken, which would help frame the industry and its further development. Thats why the company is supporting the biggest cybersecurity conference in Eastern Europe. During late September, teams from all around the world would compete in the CTF event, sponsored and supported by Hacken. Additionally, the best hackers will be hired by Hacken while their ideas would gain support and investments from within the Hacken Accelerator. Does the Community Really Need It? The question of the necessity of Hackens existence in the industry is being debated by a plethora of people. The company sees its goal and is willing to transfer it onto others. Its promoting the idea of ethical hacking and making the world more secure in terms of use of the Internet. Hacken supports the values of protecting businesses from hack attacks and getting bounties for this. The usage of blockchain technology would make it easier for the industry to achieve this objective. In turn, anonymity would help white hat hackers do their work and remain safe. However, the Hacken company is not only useful for the community. Accounting for the constant trend of growth in the industry, its obvious that investing in the Cyber Security market would also be beneficial. The use of blockchain technology makes it far easier for Hacken to find possible investors. An ICO of the company enables other people to vote with their capital and support the market by investing in HKNs. The presale of them has already started. The main sale will last until the end of November. The initial exchange rate with fiat money is 1 HKN=1 USD. More information can be found in the Whitepaper of Hacken. In turn, IT companies and other forms using IT products for their operations would also get advantages from being part of the Hacken ecosystem as clients. They would be able to acquire access to the extremely high amount of white hat hackers, whose task is to provide premium quality penetration and vulnerabilities testing. The competitive advantage of Hacken for clients is that a number of participants of the testing would be random and adequately high. All of them would remain anonymous and unaware of all the other participants of the testing process. In addition, all bugs identified will become the property of the customer. Thus, it will be protected by Hacken policy. All these facts will ensure the highest results and safety for the client. In general, the cyber security industry is currently facing constant changes and challenges . Hacken offers a viable framework and tools which would be helpful in remaining competitive and safe in this ever changing environment. The company offers a new point of view on cybersecurity and white hat hacking. Its aimed at supporting the other projects in the sphere to achieve its goal  making the world a safer and better place.

The integration of messaging and commerce holds that much promise. For example, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp each count for at least 1.2 billion active users, and Chinese messaging service WeChat boasts 2 billion. However, there is an inherent danger of social engineering, hacks, and other security vulnerabilities. Consider, for example, the risk that WhatsApp and Telegram could have faced with a flaw based on image metadata. Obsidian uses the blockchain-decentralized network, which cannot be censored or controlled by any single source. In addition, communications meta-data is scattered throughout the distributed ledger, and cannot be gathered at one central point, reducing the risk of surveillance through such digital fingerprints. Users need not link to their email addresses or telephone numbers, thereby increasing privacy. The initial concept for Obsidian was to overcome the weakness that other end-to-end-encryption messenger apps still have today, says Peter McClury, CEO of Obsidian. The issue many of these apps (WhatsApp, Signal, Wire, Threema, etc.) is that none of the well-known secure messengers protect communication metadata effectively enough, that is, who is communicating with whom.

There is a video available on their website (URL that provides a basic fast and understandable outlook of their offering: URL A few facts about Rivet (RvT) and the company developing it, Rivetz Corp: 1- They have a working relationship with the US Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security. What this means to me is, that their tech is advanced enough to be used and considered by such governmental offices. On top of that, just two months ago, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorates (S&amp;T) awarded Rivetz with a contract under Identity Verification &amp; Validation for Mobile Networks Authentication Enhancement see here : URL 2 - The concept developed by Rivetz has been in development for a few years now, and the addition of the blockchain tech, is to extend and improve a working and proven solution. The foundation of attestation are based on trusted network connect standards, already defined for 8 years. The technology has been used for contracts with US Government, the most recent is with DHS, and the rest are a mix of manufacturers, Carriers and Enterprise customers. What will the BC tech add? Blockchain is going to cause a disruption because we can put a birth certificate for a device on a chain and it will never change. Rivetz uses this birth certificate for a device to verify the data that came from the factory is unchanged. This should ultimately cause a clear liability problem for the supply chain to have data that works and can be proven came from them and has not been ""hacked"" With the new ICO funding, the technology is going to marketed to end users as well, which opens a huge market with incredible potential. 3 - Most manufacturers are already on board in relation the security measures done to the Trusted execution environment (TEE) inside the mobiles, with the remaining joining soon as needed. 4 - Steven Sprague, the CEO and co-founder will blow you away with his knowledge and insight regarding cybersecurity, security, mobile security and all related. Quoting patents, law, and so on. Yes, he does have a B.S. in mechanical engineering from Cornell, but still. I was very impressed with him after a few discussions. His URL for the curious.. 5 - Dr. Gavin Wood, founder and former CTO of Ethereum, and founder of Parity Technologies is advising the team, and working with them together to increase security in the blockchain. Dr. Wood can open doors!!! More about that here : URL and here : URL 6 - Partnership with Factom : ""Factom has selected Rivetz to integrate world cyber-security for the Factom applications, and that Rivetz has selected Factom to assure the global integrity of attribute data for Rivetz-protected applications. "" More about that here: URL I could go on and on, but these six points alone, together with viewing the white paper (URL and the overall impression I have from communicating with Steven Sprague, have led me to feel LUCKY I am aware of this project at this point, and able to participate in their ongoing ICO. You can grab some tokens now with 20% bonus here: URL The 20% bonus is limited until the 40,000 ETH cap is reached (they just passed 30k). RVT is an ERS-20 token. This project is one of the most interesting projects I have come across, with solid development behind it, a great team and advisory working on it, and a huge client base waiting to become aware of this security wonder. I am in for the long run, but expect very nice returns until then!"

264,cybersecurity,CryptoCurrency,Propy - Revolutionary Global Property Store with Decentralized Title Registry,1,6kj3z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6kj3z6/propy_revolutionary_global_property_store_with/,2017-07-01 07:53:09,"**What is Propy ?** Propy is proposing a new decentralized global real estate market with a unified real-time transaction interface approaching the functionality and speed of electronic stock market exchange platforms. It will allow real estate assets to become liquid while providing users with greater control and protection of their property rights to those provided by the government in whose jurisdiction the real estate asset is located. Propy is building a new ecosystem of token holders, brokers, governments and end users incentivized to support the transition to a seamless, secure and globally recognized P2P transaction ecosystem. **Our Story** Our Journey with Propy began when we realized that real estate transactions are incredibly slow, with poor price discovery mechanisms. The real estate market is a $217 trillion market that is highly centralized and balkanized. There are no international standards or comprehensive technology for electronic property rights transfers. Each country maintains its own registry and establishes national (or local) rules for property deed registration and transfers. Legacy land registry systems were developed to handle local investors but they are ill equipped to handle international value and ownership transfer. This leads to a less than optimal experience for many people on both sides of the marketplace. We realized that the problems laid out above could be solved by smart contracts that execute real estate ownership transfer, combined with a sleek user interface to allow for engagement with the blockchain, and a defined protocol to ensure transactions occur in compliance with local regulations. So we started developing Propy Registry: a blockchain endowed with a suite of smart contracts to track and execute real estate transactions according to regional regulations, as well as PRO: a utility token that would be required for asset transfer and other on-chain events. **The Propy Process : How does Propy Work?** Propys development team has designed a real estate transaction tool powered by smart contracts. The Propy transaction tool combines solutions from legal, Blockchain and payments industries. By using Ethereum, Propy allows each party including the broker, buyer, seller and title agent/notary - to sign off on a transaction using a private key within the existing legal framework. The scope of our current prototype is to be narrowed to prioritize for the fast adoption in one of our first markets in the US. It complies with the existing legal framework we will further refer to the US legislation and particularly the legacy and flows in California relative to real estate purchases. Under the Propy end goal model, every single step of the transaction, from the initial property reservation, through the signing of the purchase agreements, to the delivery of the title deeds, would be recorded on blockchain and executed with smart contracts. However, we also recognize the significant limitations of blockchain technology and are building a multi-stage solution to be gradually phased in over time. The Propy team works actively on several fronts to ensure that we are building the correct solution that can solve real problems while also complying with all regulations. **PRO: The Propy Utility Token** The PRO token is built on the ERC20 token standard to allow for both simple integration into users wallets.. During the token sale, a fixed amount of PRO is created. Afterwards, no more shall be minted. PRO is required for interaction with the Propy Registry. Specifically, if a user wants to change ownership of a title or register a new title, then the transaction fee for writing that data to the blockchain must be paid in PRO. Additionally, Propy Utility Token holders receive the right to vote on the price of those transaction fees, and voting power is proportional to the PRO owned. Propy will distribute PRO to governments and similar institutional clients, allowing them to engage with Propy Registry. Tokens paid for writing data to the Propy Registry are stored in a special fees smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. These aggregated amounts of tokens are added to the network growth pool, explained below. The fees contract generates a token distribution snapshot every month and distributes fees for the quarter according to the snapshot. The snapshot is stored in the blockchain, so anyone can verify that PRO from fees were distributed correctly. Here are some statistics of the Token structure and distribution: * Total Supply: 100,000,000 * Initial Sale Price per PRO Token: $1 * Token Type: Utility Token * Token sale distribution: 35% - token sale / 35% - network growth / 15% - donations / 15% - development team 35% of the tokens will be distributed over period of time to achieve network growth, particularly to potential homebuyers and brokers so they join Propy as well as to governments to incentivize them to make the first amount of ownership transfers at Propy Registry. **Token Sale**: Propy will be holding its first ever token sale on **July 25th!** Dont miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of Propys global property store! **Revenue generation** Now you are probably wondering, how will Propy generate revenue via its title registry platform? Propy has a very simple and scalable business model. When a property is purchased, Propy takes a small percentage (starting from 0.2% and averaging 1%) of the final purchase price. Propy charges brokers per transaction. The payment is initially processed in fiat and cryptocurrencies will be phased in for the jurisdictions where possible. With the market for all cross-border real estate deals amounting to $340bn, the addressable market for Propy is more than $3.4bn annually. **Future of Propy** Currently, the first iteration of the Propy DApp (which includes a centralized interface and decentralized smart contracts running in the backend) partly decentralizes the existing real estate market . It reduces reliance on a number of intermediaries required for transactions involving US-based properties and eliminates the risk of fraud. But Propy aims for a transition over time toward a pure P2P decentralized system). We like to call it P2P2: Peer-to-Peer Property Purchase. Based on our 12 years of cross-border property transaction experience, we anticipate emerging markets, hungry for investment and less encumbered by entrenched interests, will see the quickest transitions to a pure peer-to-peer framework. Propy has already begun the process of accelerating this transition across multiple metropolitan markets. As a first product developement step Propy has released the listing platform in the form of an iOS app and web-site into production and tested it with early adopters. We recognize the significant challenges of technology adoption and are building a multi-stage solution to be gradually phased in over time. The Propy team works actively on several fronts to ensure that we are building the correct solution that can solve real problems while also complying with all regulations. We aim to help propel real estate into the ecommerce era and revolutionize the industry by creating an interconnected network of token holders, brokers, governments and end users. Brokers and real estate corporations will use the system to more easily access foreign buyers and to close transactions instantly and securely online. Governments will be able to use this technology to demonstrate the transparency of their real estate market and enhance their attraction of foreign investors and consumers  buyers and sellers - will be able to trade real estate assets in real time faster, cheaper and more securely.
