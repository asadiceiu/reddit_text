1,cybersecurity,Intelligence,Soldiers with top-secret clearances say they were forced to use an app that could endanger them,1,dvdszp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/dvdszp/soldiers_with_topsecret_clearances_say_they_were/,2019-11-13 05:11:58,"URL In late October, the commander of Fort Hoods 504th Military Intelligence Brigade told her soldiers a new app could solve a lot of their communication issues. It could relay information on weather, training changes and other logistics, Army Col. Deitra L. Trotter said. She then told the soldiers to download it onto their personal smartphones, according to the Texas-based soldiers in the unit. But the soldiers  many of whom hold top-secret clearances with jobs in interrogation, human intelligence and counterintelligence  soon noticed that the apps terms of service said it could collect substantial personal data and that the developer has a presence overseas. That prompted concerns that sensitive data of intelligence soldiers could be harnessed by adversary governments, putting individuals and missions worldwide at risk, soldiers in the unit told The Washington Post. We do top-secret work, said one noncommissioned officer, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution by their chain of command. If our personal information is being put out there to a foreign power, what can they get from our brigade? Intelligence soldiers specialize in siphoning enemy communications and groom sources to deliver information about their foes, like their location and what weapons or capabilities they may have. When they deploy, some soldiers grow their hair out and wear civilian clothes to obscure their military roles and dont disclose their work outside of close family, another noncommissioned officer in the 504th said. The apps permissions  which suggested it could pull GPS location data, photos, contacts and even rewrite memory cards  frustrated soldiers who have taken extreme precautions they felt were glossed over by Trotter and other senior leaders. Just being in intelligence, we are trained to be extremely paranoid of everything, the soldier said. This is serious operational security not being considered. The worst-case scenario, he said, was our cover might be blown. While the app said permissions could be disabled, the soldiers said there was a failure of confidence it was secure. Senior leaders checked the phones of subordinates to ensure they had the app installed, soldiers in the unit said. Adversarial governments and intelligence agencies prize gateways to people who collect and manage classified information, said David Forscey, the managing director of the Aspen Institutes Cybersecurity Group. Sensitive information like loan debts, history of drug use or even a trail of adultery through dating apps are all pieces of information that can be used to blackmail soldiers or coerce them to hand over classified information, he said. One reason drug use is a question in background investigations is the U.S. wants to see what people could have to compromise you, Forscey said. Even if secrets gathered from a soldier arent apparent now, they could be useful later if correlated with other data, Forscey said. For instance, he said, there is belief that a massive Chinese hack of U.S. security clearances may have been paired with theft of medical information in the Anthem hack to find U.S. officials with access to classified information who may also have big hospital bills  making them a prime target for exploitation. And if a soldier leaves the military and enters the CIA or another agency, it would be useful for China to know who they are and what they look like. That is why U.S. officials should balance the risk of divulging sensitive information with the potential payoff, he said, which was not clear for an app that delivers rudimentary updates, like training changes or weather cancellations. [U.S. soldiers are revealing sensitive and dangerous information by jogging] The app developer, Straxis LLC, is based in Tulsa but has a subsidiary in southern India. User data wasnt stored on foreign servers and third parties do not have access to data, a company spokesperson said. Questions about security reviews during development, what user data was collected and development costs were referred to the 504th Military Intelligence Brigade, which did not address them or make Trotter available. The concern among service members circulated on Reddit and the Army WTF! moments Facebook page, a popular digital hangout for soldiers. Soldiers deleted the app in revolt. Trotter called another formation Wednesday to address the controversy, admonishing whomever talked about the issue online, soldiers in the unit said. The app was later removed from both Apples App Store and the Google Store. [The Facebook page Vets for Trump was hijacked by a North Macedonian businessman. It took months for the owners to get it back.] We are confident that the appropriate security protocols are in place to protect our Soldiers personally identifiable information, the unit said, calling the app an unclassified communications tool. Straxis, the brigade said, had developed similar apps for other units. The app was removed for a preplanned maintenance update and will return to the app stores, the unit said, though it did not explain the timing of the removal right after the outcry within the unit. On Wednesday, the brigade said the soldiers had no formal obligation to download the app. A day later, it reversed course, conceding the app was originally mandatory, but following further discussion and feedback from unit soldiers, the brigade decided it would only highly encourage use of the app. The soldiers also were frustrated over the legal review of an order to install an app on personal smartphones. Trotter told the soldiers it was approved by Army attorneys, they said, but it was unclear to soldiers if Trotter could mandate an app on their privately owned devices. One soldier said he was often away from his wife, and they sent intimate photos to each other. He could not be sure if they would land onto a server monitored by his commanders. I dont want someone else looking at my wifes [breasts], he said. The military has recently blundered in cyberspace, including troops with fitness apps unwittingly broadcast location data at secret bases worldwide. And this spring, the Army accidentally emailed spreadsheets containing sensitive information about immigrant recruits from China and Russia to some recruits themselves."

Then wikileaks was established and it was established by the CIA or some other government agency. He also talked about how the intelligence agencies often purposefully leaked classified information by leaving folders, discs, usb sticks (as far as I can remember) in public places. And then they study how this information makes it through to the media etc. and what effect it has. I think he covered more, but that's what I remember. The bit about leaving stuff in public places is what I distinctly remember. I'm not making any claims as to his credibility or credibility of his information, but I want to find that video again. I think it may have been an RT interview but I'm not sure. I think his background was in cybersecurity or something like that. If you know of it or similar videos/articles - please let me know in this thread. Thanks :)"
4,cybersecurity,Intelligence,"A Russian intelligence agency, after hacking NSA servers and stealing espionage tools and exploits, posts on reddit to expose the hack and get attention.",11,5ayy9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/5ayy9b/a_russian_intelligence_agency_after_hacking_nsa/,2016-11-04 06:49:10,"The Russian intelligence agency team calls itself **The Shadow Brokers** and has evidently hacked NSA's Equation Group staging servers and stolen some exploits and espionage tools in 2013. Now they want attention. **Background** Authenticity of the leaks: 2 months back, The Shadow Brokers claimed to have hacked the Equation Group and set up an auction for the stolen package for about a million dollars in bitcoins (this was misreported everywhere as 1 million bitcoins). They posted in [a now deleted tumblr page](URL ([retrieved from archive.org](URL note the PGP keys) and [twitter](URL releasing a few files for free to confirm the authenticity, and [they've been confirmed as authentic]( URL &gt; On Monday, a hacking group calling itself the ShadowBrokers announced an auction for what it claimed were cyber weapons made by the NSA. Based on never-before-published documents provided by the whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept can confirm that the arsenal contains authentic NSA software, part of a powerful constellation of tools used to covertly infect computers worldwide. &gt;The evidence that ties the ShadowBrokers dump to the NSA comes in an agency manual for implanting malware, classified top secret, provided by Snowden, and not previously available to the public. The draft manual instructs NSA operators to track their use of one malware program using a specific 16-character string, ace02468bdf13579. That exact same string appears throughout the ShadowBrokers leak in code associated with the same program, SECONDDATE. &gt; SECONDDATE is a tool designed to intercept web requests and redirect browsers on target computers to an NSA web server. That server, in turn, is designed to infect them with malware. &gt;SECONDDATE plays a specialized role inside a complex global system built by the U.S. government to infect and monitor what one document estimated to be millions of computers around the world. Its release by ShadowBrokers, alongside dozens of other malicious tools, marks the first time any full copies of the NSAs offensive software have been available to the public, providing a glimpse at how an elaborate system outlined in the Snowden documents looks when deployed in the real world, as well as concrete evidence that NSA hackers dont always have the last word when it comes to computer exploitation.

Shortly after the initial leaks were confirmed to be authentic, [Snowden tweeted out the links between The Shadow Brokers and Russian intelligence]( URL was [reported extensively elsewhere]( URL &gt;""Why did they do it?"" Snowden asked. ""No one knows, but I suspect this is more diplomacy than intelligence, related to the escalation around the DNC hack."" &gt;The hackers could be advertising that they have the ability to identify actions the NSA took on the compromised server, Snowden suggests  a warning of sorts. &gt;Snowden also noted that the released files end in 2013. ""When I came forward, NSA would have migrated offensive operations to new servers as a precaution,"" he suggested  a move that would have cut off the hackers' access to the server. &gt;As for who is responsible for acquiring and leaking the code on the Shadow Brokers' site, Snowden says ""circumstantial evidence and conventional wisdom"" suggest Russia. &gt; King's College London cybersecurity expert Thomas Rid tells NPR's Mary Louise Kelly the same thing. There's no hard proof, he says, but the capabilities required and the timing of the release suggest Russia. That's all circumstantial, but ""more than speculation,"" as he puts it. **Reddit activity** 2 months ago, about the time the initial leaks started, someone registered the Reddit account /u/theshadowbrokers and have been trying to get the word out about the leaks on reddit. I'll get this out of the way now, there's absolutely no proof that this is a troll account. Everything they've posted is about them trying to get attention to the fact that they've hacked the NSA and that they have the state-sponsored-level espionage tools that has been verified by reliable sources and people in the know.

5,cybersecurity,Intelligence,Culminating Analysis of DNC/DCCC/Soros/Colin-Powell/NATO-General-Breedlove/NSA-Equation-Group/Podesta Leaks and Hacks,19,5bhfkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Intelligence/comments/5bhfkz/culminating_analysis_of/,2016-11-07 06:14:03,"It has been a running theme lately that the U.S. government blaming Russia for the DNC/Podesta leaks is an attempt at deflection and is false. In the past few days, however, some very interesting pieces of information have come out from three different well-respected cybersecurity companies tasked with investigating the leaks or the groups behind these leaks. These companies are CrowsdStrike, Symantec, and SecureWorks. I think it is important that we cast away the media's non-technical analyses and go straight to the source. The founder of CrowdStrike is a Russian-American and his company has been tasked with investigating the DNC/Podesta leaks. He blames Mother Russia. Relevant excerpts: &gt;At six o'clock on the morning of May 6, Dmitri Alperovitch woke up in a Los Angeles hotel to an alarming email. Alperovitch is the thirty-six-year-old cofounder of the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, and late the previous night, his company had been asked by the Democratic National Committee to investigate a possible breach of its network. A CrowdStrike security expert had sent the DNC a proprietary software package, called Falcon, that monitors the networks of its clients in real time. Falcon ""lit up,"" the email said, within ten seconds of being installed at the DNC: Russia was in the network. &gt;Alperovitch, a slight man with a sharp, quick demeanor, called the analyst who had emailed the report. ""Are we sure it's Russia?"" he asked. &gt;The analyst said there was no doubt. Falcon had detected malicious software, or malware, that was stealing data and sending it to the same servers that had been used in a 2015 attack on the German Bundestag. The code and techniques used against the DNC resembled those from earlier attacks on the White House and the State Department. The analyst, a former intelligence officer, told Alperovitch that Falcon had identified not one but two Russian intruders: Cozy Bear, a group CrowdStrike's experts believed was affiliated with the FSB, Russia's answer to the CIA; and Fancy Bear, which they had linked to the GRU, Russian military intelligence. &gt;Alperovitch then called Shawn Henry, a tall, bald fifty-four-year-old former executive assistant director at the FBI who is now CrowdStrike's president of services. Henry led a forensics team that retraced the hackers' steps and pieced together the pathology of the breach. Over the next two weeks, they learned that Cozy Bear had been stealing emails from the DNC for more than a year. Fancy Bear, on the other hand, had been in the network for only a few weeks. Its target was the DNC research department, specifically the material that the committee was compiling on Donald Trump and other Republicans. Meanwhile, a CrowdStrike group called the Overwatch team used Falcon to monitor the hackers, a process known as shoulder-surfing. &gt;Ultimately, the teams decided it was necessary to replace the software on every computer at the DNC. Until the network was clean, secrecy was vital. On the afternoon of Friday, June 10, all DNC employees were instructed to leave their laptops in the office. Alperovitch told me that a few people worried that Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was clearing house. ""Those poor people thought they were getting fired,"" he says. &gt;For the next two days, three CrowdStrike employees worked inside DNC headquarters, replacing the software and setting up new login credentials using what Alperovitch considers to be the most secure means of choosing a password: flipping through the dictionary at random. (After this article was posted online, Alperovitch noted that the passwords included random characters in addition to the words.) The Overwatch team kept an eye on Falcon to ensure there were no new intrusions. On Sunday night, once the operation was complete, Alperovitch took his team to celebrate at the Brazilian steakhouse Fogo de Cho. &gt;... &gt;Aperovitch's June 14 blog post garnered so much media attention that even its ebullient author felt slightly overwhelmed. Inevitably there were questions about the strange names his company had given the Russian hackers. As it happened, ""Fancy Bear"" and ""Cozy Bear"" were part of a coding system Alperovitch had created. Animals signified the hackers' country of origin: Russians were bears, Chinese were pandas, Iranians were kittens, and North Koreans were named for the chollima, a mythical winged horse. By company tradition, the analyst who discovers a new hacker gets to choose the first part of the nickname. Cozy Bear got its nickname because the letters coz appeared in its malware code. Fancy Bear, meanwhile, used malware that included the word Sofacy, which reminded the analyst who found it of the Iggy Azalea song ""Fancy."" &gt;The day after the media maelstrom, the reporters were back with less friendly questions: Had Alperovitch gotten his facts right? Was he certain Russia was behind the DNC hacks? The doubts were prompted by the appearance of a blogger claiming to be from Eastern Europe who called himself Guccifer 2.0. Guccifer said that the breach was his, not Russia's. ""DNC'S servers hacked by a lone hacker,"" he wrote in a blog post that included stolen files from the DNC. ""I guess CrowdStrike customers should think twice about company's competence,"" Guccifer wrote. ""Fuck CrowdStrike!!!!!!!!!"" &gt;an incorrect attribution in public. ""Did we miss something?"" he asked CrowdStrike's forensics team. Henry and his staff went back over the evidence, all of which supported their original conclusion. &gt;Alperovitch had also never seen someone claim to be the only intruder on a site. ""No hacker goes into the network and does a full forensic investigation,"" he told me. Being called out, he said, was ""very shocking. It was clearly an attack on us as well as on the DNC."" &gt;Alperovitch initially thought that the leaks were standard espionage and that Guccifer's attacks on CrowdStrike were just a noisy reaction to being busted. ""I thought, Okay, they got really upset that they were caught,"" he said. But after documents from the DNC continued to leak, Alperovitch decided the situation was far worse than that. He concluded that the Russians wanted to use the leaked files to manipulate U. S. votersa first. ""It hit me that, holy crap, this is an influence operation. They're actually trying to inject themselves into the election,"" he said. ""I believe that we may very well wake up on the morning the day after the election and find statements from Russian adversaries saying, 'Do not trust the result.' "" &gt;... &gt;Days later, Alperovitch got a call from a Reuters reporter asking whether the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had been hacked. CrowdStrike had, in fact, been working on a breach at the DCCC; once again, Alperovitch believed that Russia was responsible. Now, however, he suspected that only Fancy Bear was involved. A lawyer for the DCCC gave Alperovitch permission to confirm the leak and to name Russia as the suspected author. &gt;Two weeks later, files from the DCCC began to appear on Guccifer 2.0's website. This time he released information about Democratic congressional candidates who were running close races in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. On August 12, he went further, publishing a spreadsheet that included the personal email addresses and phone numbers of nearly two hundred Democratic members of Congress. &gt;... &gt;Alperovitch's friends in government told him privately that an official attribution so close to the election would look political. If the government named Russia, it would be accused of carrying water for Hillary Clinton. The explanations upset Alperovitch. The silence of the American government began to feel both familiar and dangerous. ""It doesn't help us if two years from now someone gets indicted,"" he said. After Michelle Obama's passport was published online, on September 22, Alperovitch threw up his hands in exasperation. ""That is Putin giving us the finger,"" he told me. Source: [The Russian Expat Leading the Fight to Protect America](URL The guy responsible for ousting Stuxnet as being an American/Israeli cyberworm (no friend of the U.S. government/establishment) also says that his company, Symantec, has found that Russia was responsible for the leaks: &gt;It is pretty clear judging by the indicators of compromise [IOCs]. The binaries that were used to hack the DNC as well as Podestas email as well as some other Democratic campaign folks, those IOCs match binaries and also infrastructure that was used in attacks that were previously recorded by others as having Russian origin. That much we can confirm. So if you believe other peoplesprimarily governmentsattribution that those previous attacks were Russian, then these attacks are definitely connected. Were talking about the same binaries, the same tools, the same infrastructure. &gt;Weve analyzed the tools, the binaries, and the infrastructure that was used in the attack, and from that we can confirm that its connected to a group that has two names. One is Sofacy, or Cozy Bear, and The Dukes, which is also known as Fancy Bear. From the binary analysis point of view, I can tell you that the activities of these attackers have been during Russian working hours, either centered on UTC+3 or UTC+4; they dont work Russian holidays; they work Monday to Friday; there are language identifiers inside that are Russian; when you look at all the victim profiles they would be in interest to the Russian nation-state. So all of that stuff fits the profile. Now, could all those things be false flags? Sure. Other government entities obviously have come out and said it is the Russian state, and the binary forensics would definitely match that. &gt;There was another attack that happened in the Ukraine. So in December, in the Ukraine, all the power went out to about 260,000 households, or customers. They basically infiltrated the power company, got access to the machines that controlled the power, they flipped the computer switches off and shut down the power, and then they began to wipe all the machines and devicesoverriding the hard drives and trashing the machines so that they couldnt be started up again, or so that the switches couldnt come on again. Ukrainians were able to get power back after six hours by switching to manual mode. They went off their computer monitor mode and physically flipped the switches to bring the power back up. Whats interesting about that case is the fact that they were more behind technologically actually helped them. Something very similar could easily happen in the U.S. and were much more beholden to computing infrastructure here, so our ability to switch to manual mode here would be much more difficult. &gt;&gt;Is there linkage between the DNC and Podesta hacks and the 2014 State Department hacks that were also believed to be carried out by Russia? &gt;Yeah, these are being conducted by the same groups. We know that from the IOCsby looking at the tools they use and the infrastructure they use. &gt;Many of these attacks were happening prior to the nomination of Trump. Based on that theory, people believe that there was a general plan for disruption, and it may be the case now that the easiest and best way to do so is in the manner you speak, but these attacks did not just start happening post-Trumps nomination. So in that sense, there is a feeling that its not a very Trump-specific activity versus an election disruption activity. This is the easiest way for them to disrupt the election. Source: [Cybersecurity Expert: Proof Russia Behind DNC, Podesta Hacks ](URL Another cybersecurity company, SecureWorks, has published some interesting blogposts about all this: &gt;In mid-2015, CTU researchers discovered TG-4127 using the accoounts-google . com domain in spearphishing attacks targeting Google Account users.

The majority of the activity appears to focus on Russias military involvement in eastern Ukraine; for example, the email address targeted by the most phishing attempts (nine) was linked to a spokesperson for the Ukrainian prime minister. Other targets included individuals in political, military, and diplomatic positions in former Soviet states, as well as journalists, human rights organizations, and regional advocacy groups in Russia. &gt;**Other targets worldwide** &gt;Analysis of targeted individuals outside of Russia and the former Soviet states revealed that they work in a wide range of industry verticals (see Figure 6). The groups can be divided into two broad categories: &gt;* Authors, journalists, NGOs, and political activists (36%) &gt;* Government personnel, military personnel, government supply chain, and aerospace researchers (64%) &gt;TG-4127 likely targeted the groups in the first category because they criticized Russia. The groups in the second category may have information useful to the Russian government. &gt;[Figure 6. TG-4127 targeting outside of Russia and former Soviet states. ](URL &gt;**Authors and journalists** &gt;More than half (53%) of the targeted authors and journalists are Russia or Ukraine subject matter experts (see Figure 7). It is likely that the Russian state has an interest in how it is portrayed in the media. U.S.-based military spouses who wrote online content about the military and military families were also targeted. The threat actors may have been attempting to learn about broader military issues in the U.S., or gain operational insight into the military activity of the targets spouse. &gt;[Figure 7.

Figure 8 shows the distribution by category. The targets included a systems engineer working on a military simulation tool, a consultant specializing in unmanned aerial systems, an IT security consultant working for NATO, and a director of federal sales for the security arm of a multinational technology company. The threat actors likely aimed to exploit the individuals access to and knowledge of government clients information. &gt;[Figure 8. Categories of supply chain targets.](URL &gt;**Government / military personnel** &gt;TG-4127 likely targeted current and former military and government personnel for potential operational insight gained from access to their personal communications. Most of the activity focused on individuals based in the U.S. or working in NATO-linked roles (see Figure 9). &gt;[Figure 9. Nation or organization of government/military targets.](URL &gt;TG-4127 targeted high-profile Syrian rebel leaders, including a leader of the Syrian National Coalition. Russian forces have supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regime since September 2015, so it is likely the threat actors are seeking to gain intelligence on rebel forces to assist Russian and Assad regime military operations. &gt;**Success of the phishing campaign** &gt;CTU researchers analyzed 4,396 phishing URLs sent to 1,881 Google Accounts between March and September, 2015. More than half (59%) of the URLs were accessed, suggesting that the recipients at least opened the phishing page. From the available data, it is not possible to determine how many of those Google Accounts were compromised. Most of the targeted accounts received multiple phishing attempts, which may indicate that previous attempts had been unsuccessful. However, 35% of accounts that accessed the malicious link were not subject to additional attempts, possibly indicating that the compromise was successful. &gt;Of the accounts targeted once, CTU researchers determined that 60% of the recipients clicked the malicious Bitly. Of the accounts that were targeted more than once, 57% of the recipients clicked the malicious link in the repeated attempts. These results likely encourage threat actors to make additional attempts if the initial phishing email is unsuccessful. Source: [Threat Group-4127 Targets Google Accounts](URL Here's another article by SecureWorks: &gt;**Spearphishing details** &gt;The short links in the spearphishing emails redirected victims to a TG-4127-controlled URL that spoofed a legitimate Google domain. A Base64-encoded string containing the victim's full email address is passed with this URL, prepopulating a fake Google login page displayed to the victim. If a victim enters their credentials, TG-4127 can establish a session with Google and access the victim's account. The threat actors may be able to keep this session alive and maintain persistent access. &gt;**Hillary for America** &gt;TG-4127 exploited the Hillary for America campaign's use of Gmail and leveraged campaign employees' expectation of the standard Gmail login page to access their email account. When presented with TG-4127's spoofed login page (see Figure 1), victims might be convinced it was the legitimate login page for their hillaryclinton.com email account. &gt;[Figure 1. Example of a TG-4127 fake Google Account login page. ](URL &gt;CTU researchers observed the first short links targeting hillaryclinton.com email addresses being created in mid-March 2016; the last link was created in mid-May. During this period, TG-4127 created 213 short links targeting 108 email addresses on the hillaryclinton.com domain. Through open-source research, CTU researchers identified the owners of 66 of the targeted email addresses. There was no open-source footprint for the remaining 42 addresses, suggesting that TG-4127 acquired them from another source, possibly other intelligence activity. &gt;The identified email owners held a wide range of responsibilities within the Hillary for America campaign, extending from senior figures to junior employees and the group mailboxes for various regional offices. Targeted senior figures managed communications and media affairs, policy, speech writing, finance, and travel, while junior figures arranged schedules and travel for Hillary Clinton's campaign trail. Targets held the following titles: &gt; * National political director &gt; * Finance director &gt; * Director of strategic communications &gt; * Director of scheduling &gt; * Director of travel &gt; * Traveling press secretary &gt; * Travel coordinator &gt;Publicly available Bitly data reveals how many of the short links were clicked, likely by a victim opening a spearphishing email and clicking the link to the fake Gmail login page. Only 20 of the 213 short links have been clicked as of this publication. Eleven of the links were clicked once, four were clicked twice, two were clicked three times, and two were clicked four times. &gt;**Democratic National Committee** &gt;CTU researchers do not have evidence that these spearphishing emails are connected to the DNC network compromise that was revealed on June 14. However, a coincidence seems unlikely, and CTU researchers suspect that TG-4127 used the spearphishing emails or similar techniques to gain an initial foothold in the DNC network. &gt;**Personal email accounts** &gt;CTU researchers identified TG-4127 targeting 26 personal gmail.com accounts belonging to individuals linked to the Hillary for America campaign, the DNC, or other aspects of U.S. national politics. Five of the individuals also had a hillaryclinton.com email account that was targeted by TG-4127. Many of these individuals held communications, media, finance, or policy roles. They include the director of speechwriting for Hillary for America and the deputy director office of the chair at the DNC. TG-4127 created 150 short links targeting this group. As of this publication, 40 of the links have been clicked at least once. &gt;**Related activity and implications** &gt;Although the 2015 campaign did not focus on individuals associated with U.S. politics, open-source evidence suggests that TG-4127 targeted individuals connected to the U.S. White House in early 2015. The threat group also reportedly targeted the German parliament and German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union party. CTU researchers have not observed TG-4127 use this technique (using Bitly short links) to target the U.S. Republican party or the other U.S. presidential candidates whose campaigns were active between mid-March and mid-May.

I wonder why these people suddenly became so interested in the U.S. election? Regardless, we know from the Bit.ly victim profiles that Podesta, the DNC, Ukrainian/Russian journalists, Bellingcat and other enemies of Russia were targeted by these groups. This also means that those targeted by DCLeaks and Guccifer2.0 were the same people, and that the aforementioned entities are actually one. Why would they lie about being separate groups? Lastly, I have gone through all the public statements made by these groups, by going through their Twitter/Tumblr/Medium/WordPress/web posts. Here are some of the comments made by DCLeaks, Guccifer2.0 and The Shadow Brokers. Tell me if you notice a common theme: **DCLeaks** Known for hacking the emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and former NATO General Breedlove, as well as Soros' OSF intranet documents. &gt;George Soros is a Hungarian-American business magnate, investor, philanthropist, political activist and author who is of Hungarian-Jewish ancestry and holds dual citizenship. He drives more than 50 global and regional programs and foundations. Soros is named an architect and a sponsor of almost every revolution and coup around the world for the last 25 years. The USA is thought to be a vampire due to him and his puppets, not a lighthouse of freedom and democracy. His minions spill blood of millions and millions of people just to make him even more rich. Soros is an oligarch sponsoring the Democratic party, Hillary Clinton, hundreds of politicians all over the world. This website is designed to let everyone inside George Soros Open Society Foundation and related organisations. We present you the workplans, strategies, priorities and other activities of Soros.

Not the guys like Rambo or Terminator or any other like them. The world has changed. Assange, Snowden, and Manning are the heroes of the computer age. They struggle for truth and justice; they struggle to make our world better, more honest and clear. People like them make us hope for tomorrow. They are the modern heroes, they make history right now. &gt;Marcel Lazar is another hero of mine. He inspired me and showed me the way. He proved that even the powers that be have weak points. &gt;Anyway it seems that IT-companies and special services cant realize that people like me act just following their ideas but not for money. They missed the bus with Assange and Snowden, they are not ready to live in the modern world. They are not ready to meet people who are smart and brave, who are eager to fight for their ideals, who can sacrifice themselves for the better future. Working for a boss makes them slow I suppose. Do you need more proof? &gt;--- &gt; dont want to disappoint anyone, but none of the candidates has my sympathies. Each of them has skeletons in the closet and I think people have a right to know the truth about the politicians. &gt;As for me, I see great differences between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Hillary seems so much false to me, she got all her money from political activities and lobbying, she is a slave of moguls, she is bought and sold. She never had to work hard and never risked everything she had. Her words dont meet her actions. And her collusion with the DNC turned the primaries into farce. &gt;Opposite to her, Donald Trump has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says. His position is straight and clear. &gt;Anyway that doesnt mean that I support him. Im totally against his ideas about closing borders and deportation policy. Its a nonsense, absolute bullshit. &gt;I have nothing to say about Bernie Sanders. It seems he never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him! &gt;--- &gt;Here are the DCCC docs on Florida: reports, memos, briefings, dossiers, etc. You can have a look at who you are going to elect now. It may seem the congressional primaries are also becoming a farce. &gt;--- &gt;As you can see, the private server of the Clinton clan contains docs and donors lists of the Democratic committees, PACs, etc. Does it surprise you? &gt;--- &gt;It looks like big banks and corporations agreed to donate to the Democrats a certain percentage of the allocated TARP funds. &gt;--- &gt;I found out something interesting in emails between DNC employees and Hillary Clinton campaign staff. Democrats prepare a new provocation against Trump. After Trump sent his financial report in May it appeared on DNC servers at once. DNC rushed to analyze it and asked the Jones Mandel company to make an effective investigation. I wont be surprised if some mainstream media like the New York Times or CNN publish soon Trumps financial docs. No doubt who could give them. &gt;--- &gt;Id like to warn you that the Democrats may rig the elections on November 8. This may be possible because of the software installed in the FEC networks by the large IT companies. &gt;As Ive already said, their software is of poor quality, with many holes and vulnerabilities. &gt;I have registered in the FEC electronic system as an independent election observer; so I will monitor that the elections are held honestly. &gt;I also call on other hackers to join me, monitor the elections from inside and inform the U.S. society about the facts of electoral fraud.

Elites is breaking laws, many peoples know Elites guilty, Elites call top friends at law enforcement and government agencies, offer bribes, make promise future handjobs, (but no blowjobs). Elites top friends announce, no law broken, no crime commit. Reporters (not call journalist) make living say write only nice things about Elites, convince dumb cattle, is just politics, everything is awesome, check out our ads and our prostitutes. Then Elites runs for president. Why run for president when already control country like dictatorship? What this have do with fun Cyber Weapons Auction?

But first questions. &gt;Why is DirtyGrandpa threating CIA cyberwar with Russia? Why not threating with NSA or CyberCommand? CIA is cyber B-Team, yes? Where is cyber A-Team? Maybe threating is not being for external propaganda? Maybe is being for internal propaganda? Oldest control trick in book, yes? Waving flag, blaming problems on external sources, not taking responsibility for failures. But neverminding, hacking DNC is way way most important than EquationGroup losing capabilities. Amerikanskis is not knowing USSA cyber capabilities is being screwed? Where is being free press? Is ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX negligent in duties of informing Amerikanskis? Guessing Free Press is not being Free as in free beer or Free as in free of government influence? &gt;Let us be speaking regarding corruption. If Peoples#1 is having $1.00 and Peoples#2 is having $1000.00 which peoples is having more money? Which peoples is having more spending power? Voter$1 is giving $1 to politician and Voter$1000 is giving $1000 to politician, which voters is having more political power? Is both voters having equal political power? one person, one vote? Politicians, lobbyist, media, even SCOTUS (supreme court) is saying this is being true, money is not corrupting. In binary world, maybe. But world is not being binary, is it? What about peoples#3, VoterUndecided? VoterUndecided is giving no moneys and no votes. Politician is needing money for campaign to buy advertising, positive media stories, advisors, pollsters, operatives to be making VoterUndecided vote for politician. Political fundrasing, now which voter is having more political power? VoterUndecided votes for politician and politician wins. Re-election is coming. Government budget decision is required. Voter$1 is wanting politician to be spending taxes on education for making children into great thinkers, leaders, scientists. Voter$1000 is shareholder of defense &amp; intelligence company is wanting politician spending taxes on spying and war to be making benefit self, for great profit. Political favors, now, which voter is having more political power? Did theshadowbrokers lose Amerikanskis? Amerikanskis is still thinking one person, one vote? Money isnt corrupting elections, politics, govenments? &gt;USSA elections is coming! 60% of Amerikansky never voting. Best scenario is meaning half of remaining red or blue fanatics or 20% of the most fanatical is picking USSA government? A great power. A free country. A good-doer. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. On November 8th, instead of not voting, maybe be stopping the vote all together? Maybe being grinch who stopped election from coming? Maybe hacking election is being the best idea? #hackelection2016. If peoples is not being hackers, then #disruptelection2016, #disruptcorruption2016. Maybe peoples not be going to work, be finding local polling places and protesting, blocking , disrupting , smashing equipment, tearing up ballots? The wealthy elites is being weakest during elections and transition of power. Is being why USSA is targeting elections in foreign countries. Dont beleiving? Remembering Iran elections? Rembering stuxnet? Maybe is not Russia hacking election, maybe is being payback from Iran? &gt;Ok peoples theshadowbrokers is promising you a trick or treating, here it is &gt;URL &gt;URL &gt;Password = payus &gt;This is being equation group pitchimpair (redirector) keys, many missions into your networks is/was coming from these ip addresses.

What type of formal education would you pursue to get into the field, as far as online colleges go? How about self-study? Is that a possible route? Just a few questions I'm looking for answers with. I've been very interested in computers and have been poking around with Computer Science, Web Development, etc. Feel kinda lost as to what I want to do, so I'm just looking at different fields right now and came across this subreddit.
