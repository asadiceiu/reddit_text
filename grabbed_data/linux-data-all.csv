1,vulnerability,linux,Containerize all the things  minimal install + all apps as Flatpak / tools in Toolboxes,2,gcbggt,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/gcbggt/containerize_all_the_things_minimal_install_all/,2020-05-03 04:38:58,"Sooo Flatpak is a thing now, and it's just amazing. The primary reasons I personally like it are because * it partly solves the Linux(/Gnome) as a platform issue. Tobias Bernard's blog posts titled ""There is no Linux platform"", see [part1](URL and [part2](URL are excellent reads. ""The Nuclear Option"" in part2 is what I sympathize most with * From a security/privacy perspective Flatpak has great potential * It allows to work with a tiny base and all applications decoupled, enabling to have a ""extremely stable and reliable"" install, like Fedora Silverblue [strives to be like](URL The reason I write this is because I tried to go down that route, and of course there's a ton of stuff not working out yet, and maybe some of you have toyed with that stuff and can offer some tips and tricks. Now for my base I stayed on Arch. Fedora Silverblue is cool from the perspective of being immutable, but that right now is a turn off because it has Firefox baked in albeit there being a perfect Flatpak build from Mozilla themselves on [Flathub](URL (even with sensible permissions set!). And the browser working with tons of complex and possibly malicious data would be the first thing you'd want to lock up in a container away from your precious home directory. Next would be your PDF viewer, mail client (you probably heard about the [recently found vulnerability in iOS's mail client](URL that offers convenient remote code execution by sending a mail since 2012) and office suite. Firefox, most Gnome Apps and the majority of the other stuff I use can be easily removed from Arch and installed from Flathub though. The first letdown is that Gnome's control center can only alter some permissions, but or reasons that are beyond me not all of them. Thankfully [Flatseal](URL exists and offers permission management as simple as on Android. [And despite Gnome's Control Center wrongfully stating full file system access, flatpak sandboxes as configured in Flatseal](URL [Emtpy home directory: Flatpak does its sandboxing job, Gnome doesn't use a GtkFileChooer \(and thus not a Portal\) to choose Files in a Gtk Application..](URL **Here a classic Gnome-ism ensues:** There's a [half a year old pull request](URL (not even just bug report, but actual code), addressing this exact problem, but it stays unmerged for obscure reasons. The change is literally to replace the custom dialog with the simple standard GtkFileChooser (which any sane Gnome app should use - I guess?!). Apparently there's a thing called ""glom"", whose entire documentation amounts to a glorius ""Glom is an easy-to-use database designer and user interface"". The Crme de la Crme of this story: The reason why a Gnome user cannot have a sandboxed PDF viewer is literally because an absolute niche application seems to call a public function of Evince, with a [GTK Widget made from a GtkFileChooser](URL as parameter, and exactly because of this that function needs to work with a GtkWidget instead of a GtkFileChooser, the latter of which would solve all problems and make everyone happy! Makes total sense, doesn't it! &amp;#x200B; There are some Flatpak applications available on Fedora Silverblue that aren't on Flathub, one can add the Fedora remote though to help that: $ flatpak remote-add fedora-testing oci+URL $ flatpak remote-add fedora oci+URL One runtime later (Silverblue's Flatpak apps use a Fedora runtime instead of Gnome's), Tilix works! [A lot of stuff fails without XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR set, it's not set in Flatpak environments though](URL Some of it only after setting XDG\_RUNTIME\_DIR to `/run/user/$(id -u)` though, I think Flatpak either clears that or doesn't set it. I'm not sure what the ""proper"" solution to that is, one hacky is to export that variable in a script and then call your shell, and make that script your custom command in tilix. &amp;#x200B; Another topic is what to do with all the developer tools and other handy things. You can develop in containers in Gnome Builder of course, but what with all the small hacky python scripts using numpy and whatnot to do some overly specific small thing you need from time to time. Or all the toolchains for embedded development etc.. On Fedora Silverblue there's [toolbox](URL for that, which is essentially a wrapper around a wrapper around a wrapper around lxc. You can deploy any number of disposable toolboxes you like, and when you enter them you land in a docker-like container where have your files, user-id etc just like normal, but you can use the package manager of whatever distro you have your toolbox based on, and do all the dirty installs. toolbox is also in the Arch repos, and after echoing ""yourusernamehere:100000:65536"" into /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid you can use it just fine. The only drawback is that it pulls a Fedora image as your toolbox container, so you need to put up with dnf.. You can go `toolbox create --container arch --image` [`docker.io/library/archlinux:latest`](URL but it will fail upon entering like this: $ toolbox enter --container arch toolbox: invalid entry point PID of container arch The reason is probably related to ""Toolbox only works with OCI images that fulfill certain requirements"", as noted on [Github](URL &amp;#x200B; So, thank you everyone who read that wall of text. If you did, and certainly seem to have an interest in it, did you have more success? What do you think where should Gnome Shell and GDM go, in a Flatpak as well? I mean putting half of you desktop in it, and leaving the other half to your distro doesn't make much sense either.. What is your experience with toolbox? Do you have an idea about how to work with a arch based toolbox / any distro for that matter? How to get developers to set permissions of their Flatpak apps in a sensible way? Should there be a Gnome-Shell dialog in Android/LineageOS fashion where it goes ""Zoom (us.zoom.Zoom) wants read/write access to your home directory \[Accept\] \[One time only\] \[Decline\]"" and you can nope the fuck out of there before it does whatever with your stuff? And how could one get Gnome to not leave bug reports and pull requests laying around forever for no actual reason? I'm excited to read your thoughts and experiences!"

17,vulnerability,linux,What You Can Do About The COC,0,9j2fuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9j2fuz/what_you_can_do_about_the_coc/,2018-09-26 23:21:32,"You need to decide for yourself how dire your circumstances are now that the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (CCCOC) is in place. If you think the Social Justice capture of the Linux kernel is all-well-and-good, you need do nothing. Everything is running right on schedule. But if you think this heralds the end of Linux as anything resembling a meritocracy (however flawed), as well as the beginning-of-the-end of a project that you love and depend on, then you need to take action. **Nobody is coming to save you. You're going to have to save yourselves.** Whereas the [SJW Attack Survival Guide](URL is a good defense, playing only defensively leaves the non Social Justice cohort of the Linux community indefinitely vulnerable to attack, individually and collectively. To end that vulnerability, you will need to achieve something very difficult. You will need to drive the rejection of the CCCOC, and demand restoration of the Code of Conflict (or perhaps the outright rejection of anything resembling a Code of Conduct at all). You may ask, ""Why should I have to do anything? They're the ones who suck! They should do the right thing themselves, I shouldn't have to make them."" And in a way, that's all true -- but it doesn't matter. You can't wait for ""the management"" to ""come to their senses."" They have no incentive to change. **You have to motivate them to change.** Here's one form of motivation: **You go on strike.** Don't resign. Don't delete or disable your accounts. Keep them, because you'll need them when this is over (if it ever is over). But **stop volunteering**: - Stop donating money. Email them and say how much you have given in the past, and why you won't give any more. - Stop donating time and effort to commits. Email the project and list your commits, fixes, and features, and say why you won't be committing any more. - Stop answering questions and writing documentation. Instead, respond along the lines of ""I'd love to help ... once the CCCOC is removed."" - If you are paid to work on the kernel, stop doing that work. Tell them *why* you are going on strike. Go on strike, and speak up about having gone on strike, until the CCCOC is reverted and the Code of Conflict is put back in place. The longer you keep volunteering, the longer it looks like you are OK with the CCCOC. They cannot survive (at least, not as easily) without your volunteer efforts. Stop volunteering, and speak out as to why you are stopping. Be prepared to do it for longer than you think you'll have to. Threats to their cash flow, to their free-resource flow, will be a serious motivator for them to listen to you. That's a starting point. If they need further motivation, their actions between now and later will make the followup approach more obvious. Do it today. Not tomorrow, not next week, not ""later"" -- today. The longer you wait, the more inertia will build up against you. Now, I have to warn you: the consequences for you going on strike might be overwhelming. You are likely to find yourself the target of Social Justice, with all that entails. Each of you has to decide for yourself if you want to deal with that kind of fallout, and I'm not kidding when I say it is psychologically and emotionally draining. But you also have to decide for yourself if you want to just sit back and let Linux be co-opted in this way. The choice is yours. And if you see someone else going on strike with you, **support them**. Good luck."
18,vulnerability,linux,"Let's see why Flatpak and sandboxing are awesome! (Also, a response to the recent Flatkill page)",1,9n50ba,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9n50ba/lets_see_why_flatpak_and_sandboxing_are_awesome/,2018-10-11 11:13:51,"Okay, so sometimes I see some misunderstandings about Flatpak going around, and [this interesting page](URL unfortunately has not done much to help. I figured I'd take a brief moment to try and give a bit of an explanation of how exactly it works and why it's even a thing. ## Portability I'm not going to bother with this too much, since I think everyone knows this is one of Flatpak's main points. However, I've seen some people say that distro packaging helps improve security because of the people reviewing everything first. Distro packaging can bring [its own set of interesting problems](URL but *this only works for packages they want to accept*. Closed-source packages, where malicious software would realistically come from, are downloaded from the internet and never go through the actual distro screening. The only thing it really does is cause a higher barrier of entry for the average user trying to deploy their applications. ## Sandboxing This is the #1 question I see: **why do we need sandboxing?** It's easy to imagine when it comes to commercial applications, but it doesn't seem immediately obvious as to why you'd need it for an average application. However, sandboxing isn't just for malicious software. Remember: security vulnerabilities are a thing! Imagine your open-source messaging client got a security vulnerability. Now an attacker can send a malicious message, run arbitrary code, and be able to see...the application's other data. Yup: most applications that use GTK+ 3 or Qt 5 (more on this later) will usually have pretty thorough sandboxing. More portals are being created to cover more things (such as the infamous webcam), but even in its current state, if GNOME MPV were to come across an infected file, not much would really happen. ## Sandboxing (redux) Okay, now comes the main part of the Flatkill page: &gt; Almost all popular applications on flathub come with filesystem=host, filesystem=home or device=all permissions, that is, write permissions to the user home directory (and more), this effectively means that all it takes to ""escape the sandbox"" is echo download_and_execute_evil &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc. That's it. &gt; This includes Gimp, VSCode, PyCharm, Octave, Inkscape, Steam, Audacity, VLC, ... First off, Flatpak has actually solved this problem. It has a concept called ""portals"", which let applications tap into the host for various reasons. The default filesystem portal will send a D-Bus message to your desktop environment, which will display an open or save dialog and then expose only the absolute minimum to the Flatpak'd app. If this is the case, then why do all these apps require filesystem permissions? Look a second. Is there anything they share in common? GTK+ 2! Filesystem portals are used by GTK+ 3 and Qt 5, but GTK+ 2 doesn't support them. This also impacts applications built with Electron 1, since it didn't switch to GTK+ 3 until Electron 2. Of course, this problem will gradually disappear over time. GIMP is moving GTK+ 3, Inkscape already has it working in the trunk, and Electron apps like Discord will gradually move over to Electron 2 (Zulip already has). &gt; To make matters worse, the users are misled to believe the apps run sandboxed. For all these apps flatpak shows a reassuring ""sandbox"" icon when installing the app (things do not get much better even when installing in the command line - you need to know flatpak internals to understand the warnings). This has nothing to do with Flatpak itself; if you install from the command-line, then you'll see all the permissions (this came out shortly before 1.0). This is an issue with GNOME Software. I'm not arguing it's not a problem, but it's hardly worth an entire section of this page. ## Runtime updating &gt; CVE-2018-11235 reported and fixed more than 4 months ago. Flatpak VSCode, Android Studio and Sublime Text still use unpatched git version 2.9.3. This was a pretty unfortunate issue; the way runtimes are built has entirely changed with org.freedesktop.Platform 18.08, and as a result it took a long time to get out, and not all applications have upgraded to it. Eventually everything will have moved over, at which point this will no longer be an issue. In addition, the new system makes it easier for runtimes to have LTS support for *at least* 2 years. That means major issues like this requiring migrations aren't really going to happen. ## Desktop integration &gt; Running KDE apps in fakepak? Forget about desktop integration (not even font size). Okay, I genuinely have no clue what exactly they're referring to here...

19,vulnerability,linux,Linux and malwares for Linux,1,9naq7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9naq7j/linux_and_malwares_for_linux/,2018-10-12 02:02:15,"Most of us beginner linux users have a misconception that linux distros are safe from virus. Well, thats completely false and I want to explain you why. 1: Most of the packages(software) we use are from the default repos most of the time. Its the same thing like you have a smartphone which, you know can get viruses. But you dont generally care as you generally use the default provided app store which is generally trusted and safe. Unless you are a pentester or you need specially latest version of the software, you generally install the packages available in the default repo or unless you are using something like slackware where you generally end up downloading and installing packages yourself. 2: Most packages are governed by free or open source license. This means that they have to show their source code to the public. Although you may not be able to read and understand the code, someone on the internet can and does that. They know its useless attempt. It is advised to not download and install proprietary software from shady websites. But its generally very rare you will end up with this as your only option on linux distros. If you have to, try getting them running on a VM. Now comes about Installation of Windows malware using something like WINE. Well, in the case of WINE, generally, programs run as the local user previlage. There may be different and better ways to keep them from doing damage. Well, my suggestion would be to setup a new user account that cant write or change your main user's home directory, log in that account and try installing them there. Btw, scanning for viruses using Windows antivirus programs through WINE has potentiality of damaging WINE installation. Now, it could be only me but I have a hard time agreeing when people tell me that linux distros have very tiny desktop share so people wont target it. Well, some kinda linux distro powers all kinds of servers used from Space station to Banking. So there is a big target. Their CPU architecture may be different but remember that the vulnerability in those systems are the same in Desktop computers. They use the same core system exploited the same way that can be ours. So, in conclusion, if you didnt read the whole thing, stop cheating and read it. Source; My own brain"

This applies reflexively to the web browser itself. You have to restart the web browser between logging out of one JavaScript site that requires a login and logging into the next. A password is sensitive material. You can't keep a desktop email client running while viewing JavaScript. It has your password for email. You can't use the X clipboard to copy and paste anything sensitive (e.g. passwords) unless you're going to restart X before viewing JavaScript. So if you were using a password manager to log into websites with JavaScript, you now have to switch to pen and paper. Chrome has a site isolation feature you can turn on to mitigate Spectre1, but AFAIK Spectre2 could still be used to allow JavaScript in one tab to steal information from a page in another tab. Information on the site isolation feature from Google is [here](URL Firefox has a partial mitigation in reducing time source resolution. That should help with both Spectre1 and Spectre2. So that seems like the best solution at the moment. It's not clear how safe this actually makes you, though. Information on that from Mozilla on that [here](URL For Meltdown, you just need to run the latest Linux kernel. It would be nice to just block all JavaScript, but we all access sites on a daily basis that require it and even if we trust those sites, their servers could be compromised to emit malicious JavaScript. Thoughts? Is this analysis accurate? Has someone else done a better/more comprehensive analysis?"

While it happens rarely, this an industry standard best practice, which has broken down in this case. The above implies that there was an unspoken agreement between various OS and hardware vendors for not releasing/leaking information about Meltdown/Spectre until 9th Jan when a co-ordinated release will be made by all of them. Its obvious that someone among them broke this agreement and leaked the story beforehand which caused an undue panic and God knows how many unfortunate security breaches.

At the end, BSDs are the only systems that stick with the Unix philosophy and kept their OS simple and accessible by everyone, the only thing they don't have is the power of the Linux kernel and if we want to keep our systems clean and simple we would say no to systemd. * Extra Links: * URL * URL **LOTS OF PEOPLE WILL DISAGREE WITH ME**"
43,vulnerability,linux,Do more found vulnerabilities make a system less secure?,8,3n8s23,https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/3n8s23/do_more_found_vulnerabilities_make_a_system_less/,2015-10-03 02:37:19,"Lets say you want to pick a Linux distro for a serious and secure project (not at all what I am doing, theoretical). Would you look at which linux distro has less ""security patches"" or has found less vulnerabilities in its software? Kind of tricky right, because on one hand it could mean a system is more secure if it has had less security patches than another OR just that a vulnerability was not found and/or patched on the distro that has less security patches. This same goes for those charts/graph that showed up comparing Linux, OS X, and Windows vulnerabilities with Linux being the highest. The argue could be made that Linux has more vulnerabilities listed because it is open source and more people are inspecting the code, compared to Windows which had far less vulnerabilities, however OS X seemed to break the trend and had more vulnerabilities than Windows and similar to the amount in Linux but OS X is closed source. (Off-topic/not important) I just find it interesting subject and what your guys opinions are. For example, I was sort of evaluating Debian and Slackware from a security standpoint (slackware doesn't issue updates to its kernel though unless necessary and the 3.10 are EOL so that is already kind of bad I guess but whatever) and the thing I was noticing was that Debian includes things like PAM and eglibc instead of glibc but they also have a lot of vulnerabilities patches which seems good."

It seems to me that Linux works better and is far more secure than Windows. That means less maintenance is required, and cybersecurity is simplified. I can imagine myself working for a company that does consulting for these enterprises. I imagine it would be hard to convince CIO/CTOs to make the switch and land accounts, but it's not impossible. It seems that one of the most important things would be to have proof that you can get users to switch over and be productive without revolting. To me, that implies such a consulting company would need a really good training team that's skilled at persuading users that the world won't end when they stop using Windows, that using Linux isn't hard but easier to use, and that in fact it can actually be a lot of fun. So my question is: Is anyone doing this? If so, are they meeting with success? What distros do they use for servers and end points? Do they do a good job getting end users to switch, or does switching to Linux result in high turnover?"

One of the things I really care about is cybersecurity. However, one of the common refrains I hear is ""Linux doesn't need antivirus."" And this refrain continues even in light of virus like Evil GNOME. I usually see two reasons as the rationale behind this: * 1) Linux market share is small and therefore not an interesting target * 2) Package repositories are vetted and limit exposure * 3) Users should not do ""unsafe things"" However, I see problems with both arguments. For the first one, while the desktop market share is small, Android has a huge market share. But more important, Linux dominates the server market share. And servers of commercial users seem like they would be very appealing targets. As for the vetted repositories, from a security perspective, that seems to place too much of the security element (and too much of the trust) on something a user does not control. If those repositories are targeted and packages get compromised, then what? Wouldn't the OS still install them with essentially blind trust if there are no detection capabilities like AV? Relying on assumption of vetted repositories seems to not apply any defense-in-depth concepts. Third, as far as not doing ""unsafe things."" Isn't web browsing inherently unsafe? Ads can contain malicious javascript. And search engine results occasionally have results of innocuous sites that end up containing viruses (I've had my AV occasionally catch those). **Summary** In any security setup, I consider detection to be a critical component to know when something is wrong (and preferably stop a threat before it goes too far down the chain). And when I hear the reasons in the list above repeated in many places for why Linux is secure, I instinctively get concerned since those reasons seem insufficient. I'd like to get smart on Linux and migrate to it, but these types of things give me pause and confusion. Do my concerns make sense? Am I missing something?"

Well, I see many people who have no experience with anything regarding linux system install kali because they want to start learning linux but end up with a disappointment. Lets start with what is kali linux? Well, Kali linux is a linux distribution, one of many whose sole purpose is to be used in cybersecurity field. It comes with the tools that you would use in that field. Those tools are generally cross platform and can be installed at your will anyway. But they have them preinstalled to save your time. It is based on Debian. But its more than just Debian with a bunch of preinstalled tools. They have custom kernel that is designed to support many hardware used during pentesting work out of the box. Kali is not a general purpose operating system, but its designed to be only used for a specific purpose of cybersecurity research which, its pretty good at doing. And if you are someone who has no interest in cybersecurity but you use kali as your main OS, then sadly, it looks like coconut in monkey's hand, like seriously. If you are not interested to know how to do the work it was built for, then why do you even bother with it? There are plenty of other linux based operating systems that are designed to be used in normal day-to-day computing. But kali isnt one of them. But Kali is easy why??? Well, the answer could be because its based on Debian and Debian is itself an easy to use operating system. Many other popular operating systems are based on Debian which leads kali to be familiar system. But kali is hard, why??? Well, first thing to remember is that convenience is inversely proportional to freedom. The easy it is to work with the less freedom and experience/understanding you will get. Kali is made for hackers so freedom is their key motive. Also, Debian is more committed to free software. So your devices requiring nonfree drivers may not work. Another important reason is the forums. When you say you use Kali linux but ask beginner questions, people will ignore you or mock you for asking stupid question as you are using a superhacking distro of linux. Some people tend to think that kali linux users are smartest in the world so you asking beginner question will annoy the hell outta most of them.

Since LoJax rootkit resides in the compromised UEFI firmware and re-infects the system before the OS even boots, reinstalling the operating system, formatting the hard disk, or even replacing the hard drive with a new one would not be sufficient to clean the infection... Flashing the compromised firmware with legitimate software is the only way to remove such rootkit malware, which typically is not a simple task for most computer users... Since UEFI rootkit is not properly signed, **users can protect themselves against LoJax infection by enabling the Secure Boot mechanism**, which makes sure that each and every component loaded by the system firmware is properly signed with a valid certificate.""
