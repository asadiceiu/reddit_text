3,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Tip] Do not update iPhone X to iOS Fourteen when it releases,1,i0svqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/i0svqh/tip_do_not_update_iphone_x_to_ios_fourteen_when/,2020-07-31 05:52:20,"As we all know, checkm8 exploit works on A5-A11 chips, that means that these devices will forever be affected by this exploit. But, Apple introduced new restriction in iOS Fourteen, to specially break checkm8 exploit to some extent. In iOS fourteen, some SEP trickery was introduced in A10 (To be confirmed) and A11 (Confirmed) chips, in which SEP will refuse to decrypt user partition if device is booted from DFU mode (as in case of checkra1n). So, to eliminate this restriction, most probably SEP exploit is needed (and pangu demonstrated vulnerability for the same in mosec 2020). So, My suggestion here is, **DO NOT UPDATE YOUR A11 CHIP DEVICES TO LATEST iOS AS SOON AS IT DROPS.** Wait for checkra1n to get updated to bypass this SEP protection.

I thought it was pi-hole at first, but then I connected my laptop to my phone's hotspot and tried again. This didn't work either. What I ended up needing to do was plug in my iPhone to my laptop again, open up iTunes, and in the device sync settings up the top left, enable syncing over WiFi. I then proceeded to connect my laptop to my iPhone's hotspot again and it was resigned with no trouble.

With great experiences Ive had on both Unc0ver and Checkra1n, I wanted to use the two jailbreaking side by side. **Not a guide or tutorial Running iOS 13.5 on an iPhone 8 and the Checkra1n jailbreak I started by making a backup of my setup with Flashback and Batchomatic (exported my Batchomatic .deb to my computer as well). I rebooted my device, installed AltStore, then Unc0ver, and finally jailbroke with a semi-untethered jailbreak once again. I didnt even need to reboot and finish the jailbreak like normal first time jailbreaking with Unc0ver, which I guess makes sense. But I booted straight into the same exact Checkra1n setup with Unc0ver. Checkra1n to Unc0ver...couldnt be easier. Unc0ver to Checkra1n is where I ran into a little issue. Going back to Checkra1n, I rebooted my device and jailbroke with Checkra1n. Tweaks were still installed but none were working, besides the ones that came with apps. I went and queued to install Cydia Substrate and it automatically queued to uninstall Substitute as well. Got a little error and Cydia Substrate basically didnt get installed but Substitute did get uninstalled, so I just installed Cydia Substrate again. Resprung my device with terminal and all tweaks working again. Later I uninstalled Unc0ver Policy Softener as well but I think it could stay. Wanted to make sure it wasnt all a one time thing, I tested it again. I did everything all over again besides the backups and everything is still working fine. Root password didnt change, my five icon dock did get affected a little when going from Unc0ver to Checkra1n but was a easy fix. Paid tweaks also stayed on the device with no issues. I later reinstalled RocketBootstrap because Safari Plus Cepheiless ran into some communication errors with SpringBoard going from both Unc0ver to Checkra1n and vice versa. **This is not a tutorial or a guide but rather a thank you to this community, the Checkra1n team, and the Unc0ver team.

I have not been able to find an answer regarding any planned checkra1n support for something like iOS7-iOS10. n1ghtshade would be perfect for iOS7 if not for the fact that it requires a restore, unlike checkra1n. Since all phones from 4S to X possess the same bootrom vulnerability, and since all of these previous versions of iOS have already been jailbroken by other means, this should be relatively easy to accomplish, no? 2) checkra1n offers an option to allow an attempt to jailbreak untested/unsupported iOS versions, but I have not been able to find an example of anyone testing it. Has anyone tried/would anyone be willing to try this, for example, an iPhone 5 on iOS 7? Something along these lines would be a huge help. Thanks in advance!"

This is NOT confirmed with Ned himself but more so evidence that seems logical to which if ends up true, I will post updates at the end of the post. The vulnerability itself although not 100% confirmed at this stage has had its unique CVE reserved on December 18th 2019 accessible [here](URL The reason I am including the link is interesting to the point this could be the date or there around when the vulnerability was reported to the vendor, why is this important? A quote from Ned Williamson on Twitter stating: &gt;Excited to start the new year with CVE-2020-3842 :) It's a fun one and unlike the other bugs I reported so far so I'm looking forward to (responsibly) disclosing it. The key word here is ""responsibly"" although we don't know for sure when the vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor, the link provided above is an interesting find as to why the CVE was even reserved in December if it wasn't discovered yet. # Possible Release: Inline with Project Zero's 90 days policy, all newly discovered vulnerabilities reported to the vendor in 2020 by default have to wait the full 90 days before the bug becomes publicly available to everyone to research. If the issue CVE-2020-3842 was reported in December the policy becomes invalid and reverts to 90 days or if fixed, whichever comes quicker. However what I think may happen is Ned will wait the full 90 days regardless of the fix already present in iOS 13.3.1 due to that being a responsible time to do so, or the bug was discovered and reported in January 2020 and per the new policy that was what would happen anyway, but why the CVE would get reserved in mid December is confusing to say the least. My speculations are below; * Vulnerability discovered in December 2019 &amp; reported. * Patched in iOS 13.3.1 January 28th - security advisory [here](URL * Ned will release the vulnerability and write-up 90 days from report date/issue fixed.

A majority of vulnerabilities Apple patched this month reside in its web rendering engine WebKit, which is used by many apps and web browsers running on the Apple's operating system. According to the [advisory](URL just opening a maliciously crafted web content using any vulnerable WebKit-based application could allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, disclose sensitive user information, bypass sandbox restrictions, or launch universal cross-site scripting attacks on the device. Among the WebKit vulnerabilities include a consistency issue (CVE-2019-6222) that allows malicious websites to potentially access an iOS device microphone without the ""microphone-in-use"" indicator being shown. A similar vulnerability (CVE-2019-8566) has been patched in Apple's ReplayKit API that could allow a malicious application to access the iOS devices microphone without alerting the user. &gt;""An API issue existed in the handling of microphone data. This issue was addressed with improved validation,"" Apple says in its advisory briefing the ReplayKit bug. &amp;#x200B; Apple has also patched a serious logical bug (CVE-2019-8503) in WebKit that could have allowed malicious websites to execute scripts in the context of another site, allowing them to steal your information stored on other sites or launch a wide-range of online attacks. Besides WebKit issues, the advisory also revealed the existence of a critical flaw in earlier iOS versions that could lead to arbitrary code execution just by convincing victims into clicking a malicious SMS link. The SMS vulnerability, identified as CVE-2019-8553, appears to affect iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation devices. Apple has also patched a total of six vulnerabilities in iOS kernel, of which CVE-2019-8527 could allow a remote attacker to crash the system or corrupt kernel memory, CVE-2019-8514 could be used to elevate privileges, and rest allow malicious apps to read memory layout.

I am now under the name TurntTonsils, the greatest possible name I could come up with. wifiFirmwareUpdater is a tool that utilizes wifiFirmwareLoader which is already present in iOS itself to load a custom WiFi firmware, typically coming from newer iOS versions. Why is this useful? Exploits in the WiFi firmware itself are patched when using newer WiFi firmware Remember Broadpwn from iOS 10? Riley Angus, the developer of Liberty discovered the arguments that wifiFirmwareLoader had and demonstrated how it can load WiFi firmware of newer iOS versions, and also proved that Broadpwn was patched while using newer WiFi firmware here: URL So basically, if a major WiFi vulnerability is discovered and it is patched in a newer update of iOS, you dont have to update your iOS to patch it with my tool. If I were to bring my tool back there are a few things that I would need assistance with: 1. Making the tool legal by using a tool like partialzip to download the correct WiFi firmware from an IPSW without having to download the complete IPSW. - I had conflicts with people over the fact that my tool came shipped with the firmware included and I was technically legally allowed to this, but at the time I felt it was necessary to widely patch Krack on iOS 11 and Broadpwn on iOS 10. 2. Testing - I would need a lot of beta testers. The hardest thing about making the tool work correctly for me was that some A7 devices didnt use wifiFirmwareLoader, they used wifiFirmwareLoaderLegacy, which judging by the name is used with older A7 devices. These devices only required using 2 of the arguments that we use in wifiFirmwareLoader, meaning they only require 2 files instead of 4 to load the firmware. I need to know which devices do this, and figure out how to detect these devices - perhaps a certain model of the 5s does this. 3. Making a GUI wrapper - Honestly, I and many of you may not mind using a CLI tool, but it would be much easier if we could simply press a single button that searches, finds, downloads and loads the WiFi firmware. This would be my final goal before releasing it. It would also be nice to add an option for advanced users to upload their own firmware to load. Why did I take down wifiFirmwareUpdater? - Mostly because the conflict of figuring out how to load firmware on A7 devices was at the time above my pay grade, and so was downloading the WiFi firmware properly. I feel that I am more capable of these tasks. Please leave feedback below regarding if you would like to see this made, and definitely let me know if you would like to assist me in achieving the goals above."

The hackers then took advantage of an Out-Of-Bounds write to achieve sandbox escape and escalation, empowering them to access system files that would typically be locked off. Citing several reports, the hackers were able to access much more than just recently-deleted photos, which denotes how they likely achieved root filesystem access on the pwned handset. The hackers were graciously rewarded a $60,000 prize for demonstrating their ability to break into Apples iOS 12.1 operating system.

Meaning that it could be a better option than selling to other companies. I know that releasing jailbreaks for money kind of goes against the point, but it's obvious that most developers will choose the money over the community.

Among all these facts, iOS jailbreak and Cydia installer are the most famous ones, as they provide users many services that we cannot even believe. Even if the jailbreaking is familiar to the Android rooting procedure but there is a huge difference between these two platforms. # What is Cydia Installer? Cydia installer was created by the American software engineer, and developer Jay Freeman, also known as Saurik. Since after the release of this tool for iDevices, it has begun to make a revolution in Apple iOS devices. Just think you're stuck on your iPhone which means you're unable to perform any special action because of the restriction of Apple. Download Cydia opens the gate for a specific path to customize any iPhone, iPad or iPod touch device in an incredible way. &amp;#x200B; Think of Apple's official App Store so, this is similar to the app store that means you can download apps, games from the Cydia installer. But there are many advanced options have been included in the Cydia free store, more than the official store. After installing Cydia on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch devices you are able to download unlimited apps, themes, tweaks, and more beneficial stuff for free or for a minimum of low cost. Cydia also allows you to customize your iDevice in a different way and that's why the members of the jailbreak community are searching for the installer Cydia. &amp;#x200B; # Untethered, Tethered and Semi-tethered Jailbreak &amp;#x200B; When discussing Cydia and the related stuff, there is a special topic that we can just not talk about. That is jailbreaking. This is not like breaking a real jail, but removing software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It typically does this by using a series of kernel patches. Jailbreaking permits root access to iOS, allowing the downloading and installation of additional applications, extension, and themes that are unavailable through the official Apple App Store. It generally makes iOS more like Android. Apple, of course, wants all its users running safe apps and stable software - jailbreakers choose to take a little more risk for a little more control over their devices. So Apple keeps updating and make high-security restrictions over jailbreak to be a hard process. So also jailbreak community find new methods to upgrade jailbreak into the latest Apple version. There are 3 jailbreak methods, * Untethered Jailbreak * Tethered Jailbreak * SemiTethered Jailbreak Untethered Jailbreak is the most desirable jailbreak of all time. An untethered jailbreak allows you to jailbreak your device, run Cydia apps and tweaks, and reboot your device at will with no consequences. Tethered Jailbreak happens when each time you reboot your iDevice (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), the boot process will fail (youll get stuck on the Apple logo). To get around this you will need to plug your iDevice back into your computer and re-run the jailbreaking tool you originally used to jailbreak your iDevice. &amp;#x200B; SemiTethered Jailbreak is till have a tethered jailbreak but if you lose power or your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad crashes it will reboot into a semi-functioning state where you can use applications such as Phone/SMS. To put your iDevice back into a functioning and Jailbroken state you will need to plug your iDevice back into your computer and re-run the jailbreaking tool you originally used to jailbreak your iDevice. &amp;#x200B; # Cydia Installer - Latest Status As mentioned when Apple makes high technology advancement with its firmware jailbreak has become a hard process. Previously it is said that without proper jailbreak method we cannot install Cydia. But today there are online Cydia installer methods. So you can get Cydia experience without jailbreaking your device or without Apple warranty issues. The well-known [Cydia Elite](URL App is one of that Cydia installer app. It is the latest trend. Now you shouldn't worry about jailbreaking or the what firmware you are using. Because Cydia Elite supports up to iOS 11.4.1 firmware to download Cydia and it will be support for the latest iOS 12 firmware as well. Taking semi-jailbreak actions, you can download third-party apps, tweaks and customize your device never before. &amp;#x200B; # Electra Jailbreak Electra is the latest jailbreak tool available at this moment. Electra is compatible with iOS 11.3.1 and the creator Coolstar is now working on iOS 11.4 to be a success. At this time, there are two versions of Electra jailbreak. The more reliable multipath tcp exploit is only available to users registered as Apple developers. It can only be installed if signed with a valid Apple ID registered in the $99/year Apple Developers program. (No throwaway Apple IDs this time). As an added bonus, this jailbreak will last longer than the 7-day period available to non-developers. However, as all recent jailbreaks, it remains a semi-tethered jailbreak, meaning youll have to re-run the jailbreak tool on the device (without connecting to the computer) after each reboot. &amp;#x200B; Users without an Apple developer account are served by the less reliable version of the tool exploiting the vfs vulnerability. Reportedly, this version of the tool leads to a lower success rate compared to the developers' edition using the mptcp exploit. However, it does allow using throwaway Apple ID just for jailbreaking. &amp;#x200B; The latest Electra version doesn't include Cydia download but Coolstra has introduced the new feature called Seilo and according to rumors it will be the new Cydia for iOS 11.3 and higher versions. &amp;#x200B; # Cydia Eraser Jailbreaking and installing Cydia is a completely reversible process. In case you don't feel like that you don't want Cydia anymore on your device you can just remove it using the tool called Cydia eraser. Saurik, the creator of Cydia installer, also made a tool called Cydia impactor and that tool can simply remove Cydia from your device. It simply removes the jailbreak and keeps you in the same firmware. # "

Cydia also allows you to customize your iDevice in a different way and that's why the members of the jailbreak community are searching for the installer Cydia. &amp;#x200B; # Untethered, Tethered and Semi-tethered Jailbreak &amp;#x200B; When discussing Cydia and the related stuff, there is a special topic that we can just not talk about. That is jailbreaking. This is not like breaking a real jail, but removing software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. It typically does this by using a series of kernel patches. Jailbreaking permits root access to iOS, allowing the downloading and installation of additional applications, extension, and themes that are unavailable through the official Apple App Store. It generally makes iOS more like Android. &amp;#x200B; Apple, of course, wants all its users running safe apps and stable software - jailbreakers choose to take a little more risk for a little more control over their devices. So Apple keeps updating and make high-security restrictions over jailbreak to be a hard process. So also jailbreak community find new methods to upgrade jailbreak into the latest Apple version. &amp;#x200B; There are 3 jailbreak methods, * Untethered Jailbreak * Tethered Jailbreak * SemiTethered Jailbreak Untethered Jailbreak is the most desirable jailbreak of all time. An untethered jailbreak allows you to jailbreak your device, run Cydia apps and tweaks, and reboot your device at will with no consequences. &amp;#x200B; Tethered Jailbreak happens when each time you reboot your iDevice (iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch), the boot process will fail (youll get stuck on the Apple logo). To get around this you will need to plug your iDevice back into your computer and re-run the jailbreaking tool you originally used to jailbreak your iDevice. &amp;#x200B; SemiTethered Jailbreak is till have a tethered jailbreak but if you lose power or your iPhone, iPod Touch or iPad crashes it will reboot into a semi-functioning state where you can use applications such as Phone/SMS. To put your iDevice back into a functioning and Jailbroken state you will need to plug your iDevice back into your computer and re-run the jailbreaking tool you originally used to jailbreak your iDevice. &amp;#x200B; # Cydia Installer - Latest Status As mentioned when Apple makes high technology advancement with its firmware jailbreak has become a hard process. Previously it is said that without proper jailbreak method we cannot install Cydia. But today there are online Cydia installer methods. So you can get Cydia experience without jailbreaking your device or without Apple warranty issues. &amp;#x200B; The well-known Cydia Elite App is one of that Cydia installer app. It is the latest trend. Now you shouldn't worry about jailbreaking or the what firmware you are using. Because Cydia Elite supports up to iOS 11.4.1 firmware to download Cydia and it will be support for the latest iOS 12 firmware as well. Taking semi-jailbreak actions, you can download third-party apps, tweaks and customize your device never before. &amp;#x200B; # Electra Jailbreak Electra is the latest jailbreak tool available at this moment. Electra is compatible with iOS 11.3.1 and the creator Coolstar is now working on iOS 11.4 to be a success. &amp;#x200B; At this time, there are two versions of Electra jailbreak. The more reliable multipath tcp exploit is only available to users registered as Apple developers. It can only be installed if signed with a valid Apple ID registered in the $99/year Apple Developers program. (No throwaway Apple IDs this time). As an added bonus, this jailbreak will last longer than the 7-day period available to non-developers. However, as all recent jailbreaks, it remains a semi-tethered jailbreak, meaning youll have to re-run the jailbreak tool on the device (without connecting to the computer) after each reboot. &amp;#x200B; Users without an Apple developer account are served by the less reliable version of the tool exploiting the vfs vulnerability. Reportedly, this version of the tool leads to a lower success rate compared to the developers' edition using the mptcp exploit. However, it does allow using throwaway Apple ID just for jailbreaking. &amp;#x200B; The latest Electra version doesn't include Cydia download but Coolstra has introduced the new feature called Seilo and according to rumors it will be the new Cydia for iOS 11.3 and higher versions. &amp;#x200B; # Cydia Eraser Jailbreaking and installing Cydia is a completely reversible process. In case you don't feel like that you don't want Cydia anymore on your device you can just remove it using the tool called Cydia eraser. Saurik, the creator of Cydia installer, also made a tool called Cydia impactor and that tool can simply remove Cydia from your device. It simply removes the jailbreak and keeps you in the same firmware."

Let's get something straight: we have every single right to criticise the developers of tweaks, of jailbreaks, of package managers, of exploits, vulnerability finders, whoever. **Every single right.** That is, if they're warranting criticism. Should we abuse them? Hell no! All they're doing is causing a bit of drama and being Grade-A arseholes. That doesn't warrant people to ruin their lives, but it does warrant (and attract) valid criticisms. Should we stop using the things they develop? Honestly, that's up to you. I'm not going to stop using Coolstar's jailbreak, and I'll probably install Sileo once it's released, if it ends up being superior to Cydia. Don't listen to the Twitter fodder who seem to live off telling people to stop using Coolstar's jailbreak. Here's an example: now, I know Coolstar is no Thomas Edison, but Thomas Edison was a cheat who stole all his ideas. That doesn't mean we don't use lightbulbs, or any of his other ""inventions"", does it? Same applies with Coolstar. We can criticise him and use his stuff. Anyway, rant over."

70,vulnerability,jailbreak,"[Discussion] Clarifying the 11.3.1 jailbreak scene, and an ELI5 of the problem that's causing all the delays",1713,8v55q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8v55q5/discussion_clarifying_the_1131_jailbreak_scene/,2018-07-01 07:37:58,"It's now been two weeks since Ian released the `empty_list` exploit, and there's quite a lot of misinformation going around here, and based on that misinformation, people are making assumptions that the Electra team may not be releasing. I'm going to (hopefully) try to clear some of that up. #Where we are Ian Beer released 2 exploits: `multi_path` (which I'll call ""mp"" from here on out) and `empty_list` (which I'll call ""el""). mp was released first, and has a greater success rate, but must be codesigned by an Apple Developer certificate, which costs $99/year and is available for purchase on [URL el was released later, as Ian needed more time to work on it. It does not require a dev cert, and initially had a low success rate, but has since been improved by pwn20wnd, and in my experience, works about 1/3 of the time, as long as you let the kernel chill for about 5 minutes after failing/rebooting. #Explanation of the remount problem, and why the jailbreak isn't out now Everyone assumed that it would be fairly easy to recycle the old code from Electra 11.1.X and simply swap out the kernel exploits, replace the `async_wake` exploit with mp or el. However, after running the new kernel exploits, it was discovered that Apple has added a new security feature: dynamic APFS snapshotting/restoring. One of the main features of a jailbreak is being able to access the entire filesystem of the device. Think of your device's filesystem as two toy boxes. One of the boxes is labeled ""disk0s1s1"" and the other is labeled ""disk0s1s2"". disk0s1s2 is the bigger box that contains everything under /var, and is divided into sections, one for each app you have installed (the sandbox), plus some extra space for photos, iBooks, etc. disk0s1s1 is the smaller box, and it contains everything under all the other folders (/Applications, /System, /Library, etc) system apps and files needed by the system. Stock iOS lets each app write only to it's own sandbox, and all other parts of disk0s1s2 are only writable by the system. disk0s1s1 is only writable during software updates/restores. On 11.2.6 and older, once you have `task_for_pid(0)` (which is given by mp and el), it's relatively easy to mount both disk0s1s1 and disk0s1s2 as read-write. However, on 11.3, Apple introduced a new feature: when you set up your device, the system takes a picture of all the objects inside the disk0s1s1 box. From there on, every time you boot your device, the system looks at the picture, and then looks inside the box, and basically plays a game of [spot the difference](URL meticulously going through the entire disk0s1s1, and if it notices any of the objects in that box have been moved or changed, it moves them back. Any new objects are thrown out, and any missing objects are magically replaced. This is a problem, because that means, for example, /Applications/Cydia.app/ would get removed after every reboot. This led to coolstar releasing a series of alarming tweets about needing larger storage, A10+ not working, etc, but this won't be a problem because... Thankfully, this system is very new, and is therefore littered with exploits. Here's a list of all the ones I'm aware of, and their respective abilities and downsides to using them. *@umanghere aka ur0 found a vulnerability that allows both the initial remounting of / (disk0s1s1) and /var (disk0s1s2) and allows for persistent changes. pwn20wnd wrote an exploit for it, and the persistence portion of it will likely be used in Electra1131's final release, but the initial remount [causes serious problems when used, including breaking WiFi and Bluetooth](URL and so the initial remount part will not be used in the final public release. *Coolstar found a vulnerability that allows initial remounting of / and /var, but at the moment, Apple doesn't know about it. If Coolstar were to release, this would mean we have nothing for iOS 12/the future. It's in everyone's best interest to save that one, for now. *@SparkZheng found and released a vulnerability that allows initial remount of / and /var. To make this even better, Johnathan Levin @Morpheus______ announced that he would be writing an exploit for it, and using it in the QiLin. This vulnerability has none of the problems of ur0's, and Apple has already patched it, so there's no consequences down the road. So then all we as a community had to do was wait patiently. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. Levin got spammed on twitter, and it appears he has now lowered the priority of finishing the exploit because of the spam. So now, [Coolstar is fixing SparkZheng's bug himself](URL #Debunking criticisms of the electra team's actions *""If apple added so many new security features, why did the electra team tell everyone to update from 11.2.X?""* A: Because no one knew that those features had been added, and when Ian originally announced he had a tfp0 exploit, he said it was for 11.3.1, and didn't mention backwards compatibility *""I donated so that Coolstar could get an iPhone X, and now he's not releasing, I want a refund."" A: I've seen several people say this, and it really irritates me. It's a **DONATION**, not a **PURCHASE**. When you purchase something, that's when you pay a vendor, and they give you a product in return. If you buy a $200,000 Telsa or a $2 slush from Sonic, you pay them, and if they don't give you what you asked for, you are entitled to a refund. If you make a donation, that's different. That's you saying, ""I like you, and I think you should have this money"", and you (should) have no expectations in return. So, if you *donated*, you should feel good about yourself, you helped a young, aspiring developer through life, but you did not purchase an 11.3.1 jailbreak. *""They said update to 11.3.1, and now there's still no jailbreak, so it'll never happen, 'hashtag biggest troll of 2016 amirite???????"" A: It's been **two weeks**, and iOS is the most secure mobile operating system (and arguably, one of the most secure operating systems, period). If you seriously can't wait two weeks for a free tool to destroy one of the most secure OSes, you need to take a chill pill."

72,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Discussion] Why Installer 5 deserves a chance and my thoughts on it,177,8ljwgz,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8ljwgz/discussion_why_installer_5_deserves_a_chance_and/,2018-05-24 00:43:10,"Recently read this (post)[URL and want to give my own opinion on it. Before I start notice how immature the post is, clearly it's purpose is to bash Installer and not to maturely give its downsides. Some of the Installer devs have replied with pretty mature and good points. That's why I'll keep this post peaceful and will try to be as objective as possible. Firstly, I'd like to start with some of the major criticisms multiple devs made. - zip format Make a new file, add 7777 permissions to it and change ownership to root. zip that file and extract it somewhere else, did any of the permissions change? Did the ownership change? It didn't when I tried. CC: /u/Daily1JB - vulnerabilities The biggest point of Installer is getting rid of the need for dependencies. Therefore everything must be concentrated in a single app. It is easy for a dev to say ""here you got a vulnerability"" but not easy for who's working on so much things at once to not miss anything. ------ - No advantages from Cydia This is where I'd like to reply to the post above. - ""APT is a good system. No need to change it"" Indeed it is, but was it meant to be used on iOS? Most Linux systems have it preinstalled, what about iOS? The only way to install it is by using a .tar bootstrap full of 20MB of files. Is that dangerous? Of course it is. Not much for end-users, it's been tested a lot of times, but when devs take their time and put efforts in a new jailbreak indeed it is. Putting random untested files all over the filesystem doesn't sound good right? iOS's filesystem can change with time. What if there's an important change which makes an older bootstrap not work anymore? What's the worst thing that can happen? I believe you can imagine that. Just to compare, take a look at this: URL that's what a Cydia jailbreak installs on your device. **The simplest** Installer jailbreak needs just two directories, one for Installer and one for binaries. Easy to get rid of, chance of it not working with future iOS almost 0, and the best part: it's easier to bypass jailbreak detections. - ""uicache on every install is a good thing"" Literally there's no reason to waste 20 seconds of your time to run uicache, it's much easier to detect application installs. As for packages which use postinsts, I'm sure all of them run uicache manually, perfect example: Ext3nder Installer As for other arguments used by /u/Daily1Jb, they're mostly false and not based on evidence. Examples: &gt;their team has no idea what the setuid/setgid permissions are! How did they ran Installer with root permissions then? &gt;you cannot specify checksums for a package like you can with Cydia After speaking with their team, there **are** checksum checks. Also, less chance to screw up (instead of ""more"") as by default you cannot install untested packages (unless you disable the option) &gt;complicated Making an Installer repo gives you a full package management tool, you visit the website, enter the key and you can upload packages, refresh the repo with a few clicks. Cydia repos need you to manually run perl scripts to scan packages one by one and then upload the new files manually by FTP or something (depending on your repo). Yes there are some things I don't like, but I'm sure it'll get improved over time: - Repo has a plist for each iOS version-package name-package version combination and a plist for each iOS version with repo info, this is a kind of mess imo and takes some space if you have many many packages. - Not much stuff to install. Cydia repos and packages aren't compatible and every dev would have to switch over. I hope that's not an obstacle as we *need* something new, we can't hope on saurik forever. Those were my points. If you don't agree with something feel free to make a peaceful discussion with me. I'll try to answer everyone."

74,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Tutorial] iOS 11.3.1 Kernel Exploit explanation.,264,8owp2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/8owp2j/tutorial_ios_1131_kernel_exploit_explanation/,2018-06-06 11:49:22,"Hey all, I saw that there was a lot of confusion in the [release thread](URL for the new kernel exploit that's been released so I'm going to try my best to explain it in a moderately technical manner. The vulnerability occurs in the code used for networking (specifically [MultiPath TCP](URL on both MacOS and iOS. MultiPath TCP is only for use over IP (internet protocol), not over any other transport protocol. Network programming in C uses the abstraction of sockets. When declaring a socket (sockaddr struct) you can initialize it to connect to other hosts using IPv4 (AF_INET), IPv6 (AF_INET6), Bluetooth (AF_BTH), or a number of other different protocols that are declared on the system. The function responsible for handling MultiPath TCP connections in the XNU kernel can only correctly handle IPv4 or IPv6 sockaddr structs. When passed a sockaddr struct with a source and destination type that is not IP, instead of gracefully failing when the configuration is not for an internet protocol, the kernel continues with the connection function with a critical code snipped below. // code doesn't bail if sa_family was neither AF_INET nor AF_INET6 if (!(mpte-&gt;mpte_flags &amp; MPTE_SVCTYPE_CHECKED)) { if (mptcp_entitlement_check(mp_so) &lt; 0) { error = EPERM; goto out; } mpte-&gt;mpte_flags |= MPTE_SVCTYPE_CHECKED; } // copies up to 255 bytes of memory from within the application if ((mp_so-&gt;so_state &amp; (SS_ISCONNECTED|SS_ISCONNECTING)) == 0) { memcpy(&amp;mpte-&gt;mpte_dst, dst, dst-&gt;sa_len); } With the error checking failing we are able to provide arbitrary data which is trusted and not verified in the sockaddr struct. We're able to pass in a payload and the length of that payload. By trusting the length that we pass a crafted exploit can overwrite a pointer (8 bytes) in the kernel's address space from the sandbox of a user application. In the proof of concept this causes a kernel panic as when the socket is closed kfree() is called on non allocated memory. But with a correctly crafted overflow, could potentially allow a sandboxed application to escalate to kernel mode. TL;DR: We have the ability to write to a pointer which is used within kernel code. We don't know how to exploit that yet to create a break out of the sandbox, but it's in the works and exploits of this type have worked for jailbreaks in the past. "

This has already been implemented in many .ipas you may have seen floating around this sub. It has also been implemented into a file explorer, with full r/w perms. Look up @jakeshacks on Twitter. The AMFI exploit allows us to bypass code signing, or bypassing it. This is the second part of a jailbreak. This means I can edit an applications files, and the app will still run, as the code signing protections were bypassed by this exploit. This is big. Now, the only thing left is for @Saurik to update Cydia Substrate for iOS 11, as the jailbreak will be KPP-Less, meaning we go around KPP instead of trying to bypass it. He would need to fix Substrate, and once he does, we will have all we need for a jailbreak. Then, someone has to make a jb installer .ipa, which when ran, will execute the exploits, install cydia, and give it full r/w perms. Then we install Substrate from cydia and BAM. Jailbreak achieved. Hope this helps you understand what these things do."
87,vulnerability,jailbreak,"[Question] Why we don't have any access control mechanisms in jailbreak world, even after 10 years of experience?",83,7l5ene,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/7l5ene/question_why_we_dont_have_any_access_control/,2017-12-21 10:35:00,"If you jailbreak your iDevice, everything sideloaded, installed by non-Apple endosred ways (Cydia for example): * Has the full, unrestriced access to all your data stored on iDevice * Can interact with the rest of the world in behalf of you (sometimes it's intended, sometimes isn't) * Can record and track all your activity inside jailbroken iDevice, but not only * Can modify the user interface to show dialogs looks like they belong to another application (for example, *anything* can make a pop-up asking for iTunes password, even when not jailbroken) And so on I like jailbreaking, iDevices and the whole community around it, especially those young ""security researches"" who deliver things mostly beyond imagination of mere mortals, but I do care about security too. Not like that tin-foil guy who you'd just imagine right now, but still a lot more than majority of people here. If we come deeper to that, I see at least 3 aspects of iOS securty which can be done in jailbroken state, and not in regular state. And (almost) no one took them seriously * **Patching holes/CVEs/exploits after using them**. At the time of writing this, the only people who did this was Luca Todesco in YaluJB. Even if he received such crazy and mixed criticism, his jellybrick was unique in a few ways: 1. Completely open-sourced - From top to bottom, not just exploit. The UI, code to get Cydia up and running, patching hooks and so on. He used a Git hosting (GitHub in this case), so people could take his work as own forks, make changes and push them back to upstream. Sadly, only a few people did that and most of these were typos and/or troll commits. 2. He patched the hole used as entrypoint right after you press the big ""go"" button, so even if you stepped into a shady mess with weird tweaks, you've been at least protected from using that single vulnerability. 3. The guy was known and active in community (sort of), but at least he was reporting what he did more or less. Sometimes, instead of code he shared an advice but people didn't get that ""rod instead of fish"" way. At least it wasn't a shady Chinese gel brake out of nowhere. (Until now, when the people picked up their own fate in their hands and shared the knowledge and code to make the *hive-minded* jailbreak, which is extremely nice. I hope the final distributor won't close the code in any way, stopping that great time) Back to the topic, as we know how to patch the kernel image, and many of ""security researches"" here just breathe in ARM64 assembly, that should be a great opportunity to **fix security issues discloused after release of the jailbroken iOS version** making people more safe with the iOS version they use (which is usulally lagging from upstream these days). Of course - the possibitilies aren't unlimited (but releasing some iOS kernel sources, even just headers and symbols, helps a lot). * **Security of network connections** - One should know that macOS (and iOS respectively) has a great firewall solution, grandfathered from BSD userland, called *pf* (just ""packet filter""). In my opinion, it's even better than *iptables* in GNU/Linux or some commercial solutions. I use it actively in some networks with OpenBSD as firewalls/routers, and have never been so satisfied with flexibility of configuration possibilities, ease of adding new rules (even advanced, the pf configuration is just a single text file with nice syntax) and simplicity (it operates on well-known and sane UNIX philosophy, where a single tool does a single job right). On macOS, there are pf frontends like ""Little Snich"" or that another one which I couldn't recall right now - some of them are free. But it's hillarous, where desktop workstations are usually stay behind routers and firewalls in single place, they got their own networking protection measures, but the phone roaming around the world and having more open connections than *netstat* can handle on a single TTY page is actually nude, and exposes itself as a naive cild. Wouldn't it be nice to have a thing like ""Application xxx wants access pornhub dot cum, do you allow that? [Yes] [No] [Just for this connection]"". Even if it feels annoying, after few hours/days of training the basic set of rules, it profits when you check out the fiewall log and see how many unnecessary connections you've blocked. This also rewards in longer lasting battery due to not overloading your radio all the time. I know about ""Mobile data"" toggle for each app, but this wasn't made for security (apps still can access networks via wifi), but only to prevent rednecks from getting high data bills during Hawaii travels. Of course the ""app-&gt;host"" connection tracking model isn't the only mesaure of network access control, but I'll leave this to anyone else in comments, this post is getting too long (but I don't regret). * **Securing system from its user** - Or, more precisely - the code he brings into it. As I said before, when you're running on untouched iOS, you're secured by sandboxing all the applications (in theory, at least), but it gives you a comfortable feel that nothing could go wrong. When you go jailbreak, and install anything from Cydia for example, it's like inviting strangers to your home and leaving it for a while (when you lock the device, or you can't just maintain the whole OS stack). They eat your chocolate, they stress your kitty and they broke the order of channels in your cable box. But they bring alcohol, snacks and party. So you're partying. In this case, doing a UI tweaks, visual modifications, patching apps and so on. But most of the time you're doing that using tools provided by community, so it feels more like inviting friends, and hoping they won't break anything. So that means your only security measurement is a ""web of trust"" between jailbreak community members - they can vaerify each other more or less and tell you if thing X is OK or just kills your cat. For me, it was always ""better safe than sorry"" and ""trust but verify"", so I'm pretty shocked there's no way to review and maintain access for many system-wide operations for tweaks, binaries and sideloaded apps. Even the rooted Android has ""SuperSU"" to ask user if he wants this certain application or binary to elevate its privileges. It even shows the exact command line (*exec()* invocation with arguments when configured properly), so you can say ""Aha, the file explorer wants to be root-ed to access */* and other dirs without hassle"" or ""WTF why flashlight app wants to install a background service"". On iOS, you wouldn't even notice. Of course, we're not limited to *root* (UID 0) elevation checks, there are many things we can limit or notify about. Forgive me please, I don't know much about Darwin/XNU architecture these days, but I bet they provided MAC (mandatory access control) subsystems, like R(S)BAC (in Linux with grsec patchset, that ""good"" one) or SELinux (in mainline kernel, by NSA and Red Hat, that ""ugly"" one everyone turns off). So the limits can be fine-grained for specific syscalls, capabilities, files/directories accessed and so on. Most of the ""beef"" is already there, just needs to be researched a bit more and presented in some nice way to end user. This post is not meant to stress someone or demand anything from ""security"" guys or developrs, just wanted to rise some voices and spark the discussion about general iOS security, but from ""end user"" (or, more like *power user*, that old term) point of view. If something isn't clear or you want to know more, I'll be here to answer as good as I can. Edits: I suck at Markdown, Reddit does the same with implementing it."

I'm just curious about what people think of their security of their devices whilst being jailbroken or staying on the lowest firmware whilst awaiting on a jailbreak. According to URL there have been 46 Medium &amp; High remotely executable vulnerabilities addressed within iOS over the years. These include the most recent in ios 11.2: CVE-2017-13903 (and more) - Homekit vulnerability allowing acccess to IoT devices (door locks etc) CVE-2017-13879 - ios &lt;11.2 - IOMobileFrameBuffer execute arbitrary code in a privileged context CVE-2017-13876 - iOS &lt;11.2 - execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges CVE-2017-13870/CVE-2017-13866 - ioS &lt;11.2 - maliciously crafted web content may lead to arbitrary code execution CVE-2017-13867 - iOS &lt;11.2 - execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges More high profile is: CVE-2017-11120 - ios &lt;11 - This is a pretty scary one, POC code has been released which allows read/write access to the broadcom firmware remotely. CVE-2017-13861 - ios &lt;11.2 - Async_wake which as we can see once ran gives full root access to the entire filesystem CVE-2017-7047 - iOS &lt;10.3.3 - Access to userland privileges, but someone has written a cred stealer. Given we have so much of our life on our devices between finance app, work emails and social networking our devices are a pretty big target. So my questions are: * 1: Do you worry that being jailbroken or staying on old firmware could leave you open to attack? * 2: Do you think that we will see patches for major issues rolled out by developers on cydia. Back in the day when a fairly serious SSL trust issue was found (CVE-2014-1266) a cydia package was created (SSLPatch) which solved the issue. I know personally the security of my device is a big concern, given that my device can be compromised via a malicious website(CVE-2017-13870/CVE-2017-13866) or a backdoored IPA (tripple fetch/async_wake). I would hope that we would see something like SuperSU on android which detects when something is requesting higher privileges as a way of balancing having a jailbreak and being secure. "

I use these devices for security research, and am just starting to delve into KPP/past vulnerabilities in it. I want to play around with Luca's vulnerability (as it has an OSS exploit, opposed to Pangu's, even though there is a solid write-up on it from RE work). To clarify, I am not asking for someone to explain KPP. I fully understand that. I have SHSH2 with matching nonces saved for both phones from 10.2.1 to 11.2.2, and APTickets with no nonce for 9.3.3 &amp; 8.1.1. I currently have the following setup: - iPhone 5s (1): 11.1.2 (LiberiOS) -- SHSH2 with specific nonce saved. - iPhone 5s (2): 8.1.1 (TaiG) -- SHSH2 with no defined nonce saved in the form of the APTicket (I know this can't be used by Futurerestore without a nonce, which sucks) My optimal setup would be the following: - iPhone 5s (1) on 11.1.2 (LiberiOS/Whatever Saurik ends up endorsing) - iPhone 5s (2) on 10.3.3 (G0blin) -- Downgradable to 8.4.1 (and hopefully 8.1.1/9.3.3) My questions are as follows: On the 2^nd 5s, I know I can use an OTA Manifest to upgrade to 10.3.3, but speaking hypothetically, I could really go to any 10.x variant I want/have SHSH2 &amp; Nonce for, as long as I use the 10.3.3 SEP which is still OTA signed for A7, and blobs/nonce for the firmware I want to go to, right? And on that same 5s (the 2^nd one), I would like to retain the ability to downgrade to an 8.x firmware. According to /u/Samg_is_a_ninja, for A7, 8.4.1 is still OTA signed. This would mean that if I was on 10.3.3, I could go to 8.4.1 by changing my systemversion.plist to reflect the shipping firmware of the 5s (a 7.0 build), so that I would have to OTA to 8.4.1, after which, I can use Yalu (I know, many of you had trouble with it, but I dont use Cydia, I use SSH and my own bootstrap, and Ive gotten it working on another 5s before) . Samg did this on a previous thread, so I know it is possible. Would I be able to use the 2 APTickets I saved in any way to help me get to 8.1.1 or 9.3.3? Id assume no since I have no nonce to accompany them, and I assume that I cant extract the nonce form device either. Thanks ahead of time for the responses. "

Well let me analyze the situation. - Why did all of this start? People like these have always existed, but recently I've seen a slight increase of them. And just because of one thing: the death of ModMyi &amp; ZodTTD. Well let me remind you, when was the last time we saw a new package in ZodTTD? When was the last time we saw a new package in ModMyi? I'm pretty sure you use these repos just once in a month, or even worse, once in a year. Those two repos have been practically dead since ages ago, despite the release of new jailbreaks. The incoming money was insufficient to mantain them, therefore now they're archived. - Does that mean jailbreaking is dead? Absolutely not. New jailbreaks have been released over the time for massive iOS versions, and the only repo which really made use of them was BigBoss, as it was adding loads of tweaks. - ""jailbreaking is dead because iOS is more secure and exploits aren't being released"" If there's something not being released it can be anything but exploits. Just for iOS 10, Project Zero released 2 kernel exploits, 1 userland exploit and one remote exploit. They could have made thousands of $$ but that's not how P0 works. They find vulnerabilities, report them to the specific OS owners and if a patch isn't available for the **public** within 90 days, the vulnerability is automatically released. It being patched in betas doesn't count. It has to be a public version. 11.2 has been in beta since quite a long time. There's a big chance, if an exploit of P0 is patched when it's public, that exploit will be released. Same as last year with iOS 10. Other than P0 there are other people who do release exploits, take as an example Adam Donenfeld who released his exploit back in August and a jailbreak was made from it. - ""3 MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND STILL NO JAILBREAK!!!"" That's the approximate time it has taken each year. The first iOS 10 jailbreak was released in mid-December. - ""jailbreaks aren't getting released"" Let's count the number of jailbreaks released in 2016: 1. Pangu for 9.1 2. Pangu for 9.3.3 3. Yalu for 10.1.1 And now in 2017: 1. Yalu for 10.2 and extra_recipe for 10.1.1 2. Home Depot for 9.1-9.3.4 3. Phoenix for 9.3.5 4. etasonJB for 8.4.1 5. Saigon for 10.2.1 I know some of these might be half-assed but hey, they're still doin' it! They're learning! Why so pessimistic? - Conclusion Exploits are getting released frequently, many young devs are learning more and more about iOS and jailbreaks are being made. It just takes time! Be patient people! "

It's okay to be lazy, I am lazy too. But if we really want a jailbreak, then let's EDUCATE OURSELVES and learn the languages that is NEEDED to find the vulnerabilities, C, C++, Objective C and Assembly if you want to find the vulns. Once a vulnerability is found SHARE it with the community to make an exploit. I only know Python so far, but I have looked more into the languages that are needed to find the vulnerabilities. THERE YOU HAVE IT. The REAL reason why jailbreak is dying. Don't beg, but give and we will come far in this community. Peace. "

I had the perfect fucking setup on 10.2, and it looked fantastic. I liked all of the nice tweaks I'd bought and downloaded and stuff, and I also liked all of the other customizations I could make to my otherwise boring phone. I had so many nice pictures from my recent trips to the Biltmore and Universal Studios during the summer, and everything seemed to be just fine. Too perfect to fail. My iPhone SE turned into a paperweight a few months ago when I accidentally installed an outdated version of AppSync, and it really fucking sucks. It was stuck in a boot-loop and everything. I was understandably devastated, and I searched for solutions for about two months. I even called Apple's tech support line and the operator offered to help me, but to no avail. Maybe I deserved it because I was trying to download an app that seemed way too expensive. I don't know. ""You wouldn't steal a car,"" and all of that shit. Fucking AppAddict. (to mods: i will steer away from piracy from now on, pls don't remove) Anyway, I had to restore to 10.3.2 and that also really sucked, because I had to lose that wonderful jailbreak. I don't want to sound like an idiot, but God, that was just fucking stupid. I absolutely hated it. I hated vanilla 10.3.2 so much. I kinda also hated myself for making that absolutely asinine mistake. I had to start all over with this garbage phone. And yes, I think that iPhones are garbage without that little nudge. It feels so... restrictive. Every week or so I skim /r/jailbreak in hope that I'd see ""10.3.2 JAILBREAK RELEASED BY SHADY CHINESE HACKER TEAM"" or ""SAURIK RELEASES 10.3.x -&gt; 10.2 DOWNGRADE TOOL"", but nope. Not at all. It's so pointless to do so, too, because if a legit jailbreak were released I would hear my phone vibrating. It would've already been announced on Discord. Honestly, I feel as if I'm an entitled person to see it that way. Actually, I could say that about most of everyone here. I could say that mostly everyone here is waiting for that sweet, sweet post at the top saying that a jailbreak for their little iOS version has been released. Sure, they have no obligation to actually release the damned thing to the public, but just don't whip your reddit post out of your pants and start jerking yourself off for those nice Internet points. Sure, finding a vulnerability in iOS these days requires the involvement of blood, sweat, and tears, but I'm so selfish I don't even fucking give a shit. I want my phone to look cool. I want my phone to have even more useless little ""features"" and gimmicks so I can say my phone's icons rotate when I swipe the springboard. I'm thinking of getting one of those Android phones, but it's way too clunky and ugly. Play Music is awful and Play Store is full of garbage apps. I think I might actually stick with Apple in hope I'll finally get the post of my dreams. [/rant]"

I've tried a few things since and I thought I'd share my results. **Edit: The first step to getting the corrected firmware is to download the iOS 10.3.3 IPSW. Once this is done, you can unzip it (IPSW's are zip files). In the decompressed output folder, there will be several dmg files. The largest one is the root file system. If you double click this file on OS X it will be mounted and open. I'm not too sure how to do this on Windows** In /usr/share/fimware/wifi/ there is a folder that corresponds to the Wi-Fi chip model in your iDevice. Inside this will be several files (txt, trx and possibly some other files). These files are responsible for controlling the Wi-Fi card in your iDevice. **Edit: To identify which firmware files are required for your device, run:** >/usr/libexec/wifiFirmwareLoader -f You should get output similar to: >Resolved to Firmware file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/4324b5/syrah.trx"" > >Resolved to NVRAM file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/4324b5/syrah-m-mt.txt"" > >Resolved to Regulatory file path: """" > >Resolved to TxCap file path: """" Other devices (my 6s+ for example) have different output: >Resolved to Firmware file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/C-4350__s-C5/pinotnoir.trx"" > >Resolved to NVRAM file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/C-4350__s-C5/P-pinotnoir_M-BLMA_V-m__m-5.5.txt"" > >Resolved to Regulatory file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/C-4350__s-C5/pinotnoir.clmb"" > >Resolved to TxCap file path: ""/usr/share/firmware/wifi/C-4350__s-C5/pinotnoir.txcb"" My (very limited) understanding of the recent iOS/Android Wi-Fi vulnerabilities is that the main issue is within the Wi-Fi firmware file.

With all that said, I can't test Broadpwn or the Google Project Zero exploits, so I can't be entirely certain the vulnerabilities are avoided! **Edit: I found a good overview of Broadpwn [here](URL Using this example hostapd configuration, I created a ""Broadpwn-ish"" Wi-Fi network with Linux. When using the default 6s+ 10.2 Wi-Fi firmware, I immediately received the message 'Unable to join the network ""YourNetworkNameHere""' upon trying to connect.** **When I force loaded the iOS 10.3.3 Wi-Fi firmware, I was able to connect to the network and browse as usual! This behaviour is reproducible after several firmware loads and connection attempts and is the first solid indication I have that the new firmware makes a positive difference. Loading the new Wi-Fi firmware is best done with Wi-Fi switched off. After this is done, Wi-Fi can be toggled continually without needing to reload the firmware manually. Interestingly, my iPad on 9.3.2 seems happy to connect regardless of the Wi-Fi firmware used.**"

GeoSn0w here! **Spoiler alert! Long tutorial, suitable for beginners!** A couple days ago I've decided to try to complete the Xylex challenge created by developer Billy Ellis. Some of you know Billy already, but for those who don't I'll have some links down below. Basically, Xylex is an application that is made purposefully vulnerable by Billy as part of his Exploit-challenges project on GitHub. As I liked the idea of trying some ROP, I've decided to complete the challenge and while I am at it, maybe to also write a tutorial. Keep in mind, this is going to be a long tutorial, so reload your patience cartridges and let's do it. Also, do keep in mind that Billy made a very good video on it too, will have a link down below if you're a visual learner. **Enough Introduction, let's sploit** Okay, so we know that Xylex is an armv7 Mach-O binary, this means we can't play with it in macOS terminal, we have to side-load it to a Jailbroken device. I think any device would do. I have tried on aarch64 as well and it works. You can [download the armv7 compiled Xylex from Billy's Github](URL I've used iFunBox to load it into DCIM and from there I've moved it with Filza to a Development folder somewhere in */var/* Okay so when we run the application for the first time, via SSH, of course, as we want to exploit it remotely from the PC, [we can see an ASCII welcome screen](URL As you can see from the screenshot, the application asks for authentication (username only), so I thought I should try feeding the app a couple ""AAAAA"" to see if we can trigger a crash and therefore a buffer overflow, but the application is apparently well made and it is not vulnerable on that part as can be seen from the next screenshot. [The application responds with the fact that there is no user with that name and quits normally](URL Okay, so we need another approach. Time to fire up Hopper (Or IDA... Or Radare...). Okay, so we've loaded the Mach-O into Hopper Disassembler, and we've located the _main function. [In this screenshot of Hopper you can see that we've located the ASCII welcome message](URL and looking a bit further down we can easily spot the username being hardcoded into the app and that being *guest* [as can be seen from here](URL Let's test the username we've found hardcoded in the app. [Yep, it does indeed work and sends us to a new screen](URL Okay, but how can we exploit this application so that we can change its control flow in a way that it would facilitate us to do things that were not intended to be done? Well, since the username part seem to not be vulnerable, let's try further with something else. You can see that after we've managed to log in, the app gives 3 possible operations: * Display system version, which in fact displays Xylex version, not very useful for what we need as it does not accept any kind of user inputs. * Open file (now we're talking!) * Exit (clearly not useful for us) Okay, so we have a feature that allows us to open files inside Xylex, well, let's try the same fuzzing method, only inside a file. In order to craft our file we can use the following command in terminal: printf ""AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" &gt; testdummy That would create a a new file called testdummy in the current directory containing a bunch of ""A"". Let's see what effect it has on Xylex once we load it on. Sweeeeet! [As you can see the application has returned ""Segmentation Failed: 11""](URL which means it has crashed, so it is definitely vulnerable! We've got the vulnerability, now how we can exploit it? Well, let's first find the cause of the crash. To do that, we're going to analyze the crashlog. The crashlogs can be found on the following path */var/mobile/Library/Logs/CrashReporter/* and as you can see, with *ls* command we can see all the crash logs, including Xylex. We're going to select the most recent. [The date is in the name of the log as can be seen here](URL Let's cat the last log. [As you can see, we've managed to overwrite the PC (Program counter) register with 0x41414140 which is the hex for ""AAAAA""](URL So we basically got control over the program's flow, but where? The PC holds the address to which the program flow will be redirected next, so if we can possibly put our own address there, we can execute whatever we want, but what we want to execute? Let's go ahead back to Hopper and see if we can find anything useful, but before we do that, we must see WHERE in that huge chunk of ""A""s is the PC being overwritten? We need to know that either way, there's nothing much we can do with this vuln. To do that, let's change our testdummy file from ""AAAAA"" to a pattern like ""AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDD"" so that we can detect in which group the PC gets overwritten. So the command would look like: printf ""AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHHKKKKLLLLMMMM"" &gt; testdummy Alright, so we've managed to produce another ""Segmentation Fault:11"" with the new file, now let's analyze the crash log an see which pair caused the overwrite on PC. [As you can see from the crashlog, PC is now *0x46464646*](URL which happens to be ""F"" in hex, so we know that the PC register got overwritten after E. There is where we are going to place our good stuff, but what is this good stuff? Time for Hooper. As you can see, in Hopper we can easily see [the system() function being referenced](URL and Billy was kind enough to leave an [""uname -a""](URL in the program at address *0xc040* ;) So theoretically we can pwn the program so that once our shellcode is loaded via the file opening function, we redirect the program to a specific address and possibly execute *uname -a* which will give us details about the iDevice (the Kernel version and so on). This was never intended to be possible, so how the hell we can do that? Billy has left an Easter egg for us in the program, apparently. See, there is a *_gadget* method at *0xbb74* that literally contains pop {r0, pc} A better ROP gadget wouldn't be possible for this program. If we can overwrite the PC (program counter) and the r0 (general purpose register) to contain the good stuff we need, we will be able to run our command and hijack the program! Okay, so we have all we need, now we need to craft our shellcode. We're going to use the chars from A to E as and then we're going to place the good stuff. Let's collect addresses ;) We know that ""uname -a"" is located at address *0xc040* and if you look closely, at 0xbb98, we have a branch with link (bl) instruction that looks like this: 0000bb98 bl imp___symbolstub1__system [Here we go with our system() call!](URL Okay, so we have the gadget and the good stuff, we know where PC register gets overwritten, let's craft our shellcode: So we have the following important addresses collected: * 0xbb74 - The _gadget we're going to use! * 0xbb98 - The system() call! * 0xc040 - The ""uname -a"" command! At first we will copy the A -&gt; E from the dummy file: AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE And now we add the addresses we've collected. Now, because the byte sex is Little Endian, we have to put it backwards! like this: AAAABBBBCCCCDDDDEEEE\x74\xbb\x00\x00\x40\xc0\x00\x00\x98\xbb\x00\x00 So we have the addresses written in Little Endian, and we have the gadget, the uname command and finally the system() call. [Let's write this into a new exploit file!](URL Okay, now let's feed the exploit file to the program and see what happens! [AND HERE IS THE RESULT!](URL As you can see, we've pwned the program! It did run ""uname -a"", printed out the output of the command which is represented by details about the kernel, and the Seg. Faulted and quit :) That's it! We've pwned the program, controlled the flow of it, ran an arbitrary command and got to where we wanted! Thanks a lot of reading, I really hope you've enjoyed this tutorial, took a while to put together, and I wanna thank **Billy Ellis** for the amazing Xylex program he has created. Billy has also made a video with the exploitation (exactly what we did) of Xylex. *Other Resources* * [A video tutorial on this by Billy Ellis](URL * [Follow Billy on Twitter](URL * [You can also check my iOS Channel if you want](URL * [Or follow me on twitter if you wish](URL I hope this tutorial helps!

119,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Discussion] What makes a tethered Jailbreak to be Untethered,395,661f4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/661f4e/discussion_what_makes_a_tethered_jailbreak_to_be/,2017-04-18 17:33:36,"Hi r/Jailbreak, GeoSn0w here! ! This page is NOT a tutorial on how to untether your Jailbreak! In this post I wanted to talk a bit about what makes a jailbreak to be either tethered or untethered and why we see less and less untethered Jailbreaks. Some of you who are a bit more into the iOS Security might already know this stuff, but having a YouTube channel I literally get asked dozens of times what is the difference, or what makes a jailbreak to be untethered, so assuming there are newbies as well let us begin. A jailbreak usually makes use of what we call exploits to either disable or bypass a security mechanism, usually from the kernel-side (but NOT only). I know it will sound weird but having Cydia doesn't mean you are Jailbroken. A lot of people confuse Cydia with the Jailbreak itself, while Cydia is just a result of it. I've mentioned something about exploits, these exploits make use of an unpatched vulnerability to disable security mechanisms on the iOS, here we talk about mechanisms like: * CodeSign * AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) * ROOT File System Permissions (Gets remounted from Read only to Read / Write) * KPP (Kernel Patch Protection) (Starting from iOS 9.x) * Sandbox escaping (our apps have to be able to modify files in ROOT if so is needed - without this, Cydia would fail to work). * Many other things. So you can see, a Jailbreak is composed out of a lot of components, but those enumerated are all part of iOS Kernel's Security. In order to do the mentioned patches, we need additional exploits to get into the position in which we CAN produce the above mentioned patches. iOS Kernel is protected by Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization (kASLR), by canaries (data that once changed triggers a security mechanism preventing buffer overflows), the __DATA.__CONST section of the kernel is now non-executable (DEP (Data Execution Protection)) (making the exploitable area smaller), etc. So that was an introduction on what a Jailbreak really does internally, apart of unpacking a tar archive full of binaries and dylibs for later use. BUT WHAT MAKES IT UNTETHERED OR TETHERED? An untethered Jailbreak has persistence, if you reboot the device, you will still be Jailbroken without being required to perform any Yalu operation or to open any app. The way it is done can vary: * Low Level * Kernel-Level In low level Jailbreaks, specific to A4 and lower devices usually or older iOS versions, the BootROM is being exploited (with limera1n, 24kpwn, alloc8, etc.) A patched LLB is also loaded (LLB is part of iOS's BOOTCHAIN about which you can read more on TheiPhoneWiki). That patched LLB is usually stripped off its signature checks so that it would allow loading of a pre-patched Kernel thus making the Jailbreak to enter in effect after the bootchain ends (when SpringBoard loads). As you can see this method is no longer used today due to its BIG price: iBOOT and BOOTROM 0days. BootRom exploits can't be patched by Apple but finding the Philosopher's Stone is easier than finding a BOOTROM exploit on iOS. iBOOT Exploits on the other hand although nearly as powerful, can easily be patched by Apple in the next iOS version (that's why the existing (known) iBOOT Exploit of iH8Sn0w doesn't get published). It would make the iPhone 5, 5C, 4S Jailbroken for life, but with the price of it being patched. So we remain with what has been used lately, Userland exploits (aka Exploits loaded from a crafted iOS App that runs normally). Pangu used this method, Luca used this method. TAIG used a crafted Backup if I remember well. Anyways, the principle behind this is simple. You open the app, it triggers the exploit chains, Kernel gets patched out of its security mechanisms, a respring takes place, you're Jailbroken. The reason this is NOT tethered is the simple fact that loading the exploit automatically at boot-time is not possible in that format. Can an untehter be written for an already constructed tethered Jailbreak? Definitely, and it was done in the past. If I recall well, another method to untether a jailbreak, was to use a vulnerability in the launchd to make it load a jailbreak daemon at boot time that would carry out the entire process, of course Apple has patched that. So, yes, untethers can be written, but they have to run at a lower level than the normal apps and it has to be able to do that at boot-time. Let's face it, such exploit would fetch a premium on Apple's Bounty program. Apart of the fact that the untethered Jailbreak is automatically loaded at boot-time compared to the tethered Jailbreak that has to be manually applied, there are no other differences for the normal user. For a more advanced user: You can use serialsh tool via DCSD, Kernel debugging maybe a bit harder? (again from the DCSD side). Other dev-related issues. Unfortunately the tethered Jailbreak might become a trend in the future as the powerful exploits that would allow it to be untethered would either be sold or reported to Apple's Bounty program (can we blame any dev for that? Nope) or they would simply not exist. I hope I made things clear, and hopefully this page would help newbies interested in iOS Security."

Or is a separate vulnerability exploit needed to elevate from mobile to root? From earlier I have created a simple tool that executes task_for_pid(,,&amp;0) and prints the result. The intention was to help determine if a jailbroken device could run kloader, but I have used it to confirm that only root (not mobile) can successfully call task_for_pid(,,&amp;0), even if the tool is (fake-)signed with the task_for_pid-allow entitlement. My idea involves creating a specially designed app, signing it with task_for_pid-allow and some other entitlements, sideloading it using a free 7 day certificate and then executing the thing using the 935csbypass code. My goal is ***not*** to create a jailbreak, but to create a very specific program that would borrow some source code from kloader and include everything it needs inside the binary. My target is a 32 bit device, so KPP need not be considered. Is this doable? If not: 1. Which protection mechanisms have I not considered? 2. Has anybody even managed to jailbreak 9.3.5 yet? My willingness to restore my device to 9.3.5 depends on the likelihood of a jailbreak for it being released in the (distant) future, and I consider that likelihood to be greater once 9.3.5 has been proven jailbreakable. --- PS. By task_for_pid(,,&amp;0) I mean task_for_pid(mach_task_self(), 0, &amp;k) where k is an int set to 0. The goal (please dont laugh if Im being too nave) is to create a binary that contains and loads pwnediBSS (i.e. not a very portable app!). I would use it on an iPhone 4S (a family member accidentally upgraded from 6.1.3) and an iPad 2 (on 6.1.3, in my possession, but in a boot loop). If there is any hope I will restore the iPad 2 to 9.3.5 and use it for development. I havent really used it for a couple of years anyway, but it would be nice to have it back on 6.1.3 because I want it for an app that no longer works after I upgraded my iPhone. If years of experience with advanced low-level iOS stuff is required, I will keep my iPad in the boot loop and try to find some other solution instead.

Snapchat patched it where if their data base is able to read only and not write it will crash. Therefore if you updated snapchat will crash when you try to open it. On it to find a new vulnerability. Mean while, use the supported version. Thanks."
129,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Meta] &amp; [Discussion] A few things I feel like need to be mentioned for the community,31,5gpp3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5gpp3g/meta_discussion_a_few_things_i_feel_like_need_to/,2016-12-06 11:32:49,"**Hoping to addressing four topics:** - Things jailbreak tweaks can do - What goes into a jailbreak - Regarding posting and commenting on this sub - Subreddit quality contributors *Before reading, please note that this is a fairly long post. I recommend only reading the parts you're interested in. I've tried to make this an easy read, however some parts have technical terms. The information provided is to the best of my knowledge. If you don't believe any information is accurate please comment with a source. Thank you.* ____ #Things jailbreak tweaks can do Jailbreak tweaks can modify just about anything on the device. You already know this. Let's talk about limitations. First thing is hardware. Tweaks can't add hardware features. Touch ID is hardware. 3D Touch is hardware (there are many emulation tweaks, I'm aware). Portrait mode on the iPhone 7 is hardware, the dual lens camera allows for perception (emulations may be a possibility for this). Secondly, server side information. Anything that occurs on the server can't be effected. There was a tweak for Twitter a while ago that allowed you to view private profiles because the server came back and asked the device if the user was following the private user. Not many apps do things like this though, so anything that seems server-side probably is. This third point is something is a little bit more intricate and explores the different types of exploits. For the most part, the community currently has a semi-tethered, untethered, and bootROM jailbreaks. A jailbreak can't execute on anything before it's active, and the following explains when that time is. - **Semi-tethered** - Jailbreak goes into effect after the memory corruption vulnerability is exploited. A full re-boot fully clears the memory, and the vulnerability needs to be exploited again. - **Untethered** - Jailbreak goes into effect when the third-party dylib is loaded. This occurs during the boot sequence. - **BootROM** - Jailbreak is active all the time. Only an iTunes restore can unjailbreak the device (there are also rumors that DFU mode disables the exploit, but it's a little hard for me to confirm that). We could talk about bootROM exploits for a long time, so if you'd like another post about that, please comment, or you can just [Google it](URL Just felt that it should be included in this segment that there are **rumors** that Apple has a third executable user (versus daemon ""users"") on iOS 7 and above that handles certain processes. _____ #What goes into a jailbreak? **Note: I'm going to glaze over some of this information because I'm only focusing on one aspect** First you need an exploit. This is the reason Apple doesn't like jailbreaking, exploits in their OSs are bad for them. *Google released an [exploit for iOS 10.0.3 and below](URL Secondly, you need to act on the exploit. I really don't know much about this, but Pangu says they load a dylib and some magic happens (can be found on [slides 10, 14, &amp; 23](URL Thirdly, and my understanding of what the problem is, is MobileSubstrate. I have no idea what the problem with this is, but apparently MobileSubstrate needs to be changed for each iOS (I'm hoping /u/Saurik or someone can clarify upon this). ____ #Regarding posting and commenting on this sub First off, [Request] posts. There are a lot of requests and not a whole lot of developers. Some people are also very, very rude in posts, ""This is a tweak the community NEEDS. A developer needs to make this NOW."" First of all, fuck you. Secondly, I don't believe there are any developers that develop **tweaks** as their full time job. I once got a comment saying that he was ""tired of people giving half-ass alternatives"" on [Request] posts. As I mentioned before, there aren't a lot of developers. Every tweak isn't going to be made. If there's a work around with current tweaks, or even stock iOS settings, this is a far more viable option for us to provide for answers. Secondly, re-posts. Two parts to this. First is re-posting your own post ten minutes later. The chance that a different person is going to see your second post that didn't see your first post is extremely small. Second part is re-posting someone else's post by accident because you didn't search. I understand that Reddit search is slightly sketchy, especially on mobile, but Google is great too, and most the time turns up a Reddit post. Thirdly, people asking for a post to be made and pinned. There are a fair amount of people that say things like, ""There should be a post about how to enter No Substrate mode and it should be pinned"". No. It shouldn't. People *should* search. The other thing is that Reddit only allows two pinned posts per sub. [This sub-section was removed during the draft process for this post] [This sub-section was removed due to sub rules] ____ #Subreddit quality contributors This is something I've kind of asked for before, but I wanted to add it into this post. I think there are some people that are on this sub a lot, especially /u/gabe-nick, who should have a special flair that says something like, ""Quality contributor"" (just got this name idea from r/LegalAdvice). This is helpful for two reasons. First is that it's a little token of gratitude to the people that are just on the sub helping the common person. Before I go on, I'm not discounting developers that are helping out here, but they have their own flair, and they do a different kind of hard work. Second is that if there are comments on a post that are incorrect, and someone (a ""quality contributor"") has the correct answer, the OP can try out this option first. Just as an example, I recently saw a post where they had wiped their iOS 9.3.2 device using iCloud and there were three comments saying ""Welcome to iOS 10"". On iOS 9.2 to 9.3.3 there is a fix for using an iCloud wipe or Erase All Content and Settings. Having three comments to one doesn't look good. ____ Thank you first and foremost, Pangu, who had been releasing the most recent jailbreaks. Thank you developers, without you, jailbreaking wouldn't be as fun, and personally, useless. Thank you ""quality contributors"" who make this sub a helpful place to come to. Thank you everyone else  _____  ipad_kid "

Maybe edit your post to reflect this? Otherwise you might discourage people from saving the blobs who could actually use them. Not promising it will work, just saying Luca mentioned that his tool DOES have tfp0 equivalent. &gt; URL People who came for the title of the post (and who unwillingly updated to 10.1.1) apologies for that case but I can't edit the title now. *** [tihmstar](URL explained on his [video](URL that his method not only requires a jailbroken device, it also requires a jailbreak with task_for_pid 0 patch which is only present on iOS 9.1 jailbreak. Now I don't know you but I think Pangu having updating their jailbreak after all this time (if at all possible) is slim. If you have an iPhone 5S or iPad Air though, *most likely* you will be able to downgrade for life without needing a jailbreak because these devices generate random nonces with less than sufficient entropy it seems so they generate the same nonces over and over again. This takes some time though but practical enough it seems that tihmstar can successfully exploit this vulnerability. Now that is a wonderful exploit I admit but those who are waiting the 10.1.1 jailbreak to finish to update, there is a high chance that you won't be able to. ~~TL;DR Update to 10.1.1 ASAP.~~ **EDIT:** Regarding iPhone5S and iPad Air, this is NOT available to _ALL OF THEM_, [as he said](URL &gt; There is **A CHANCE** that if you did this nonces thing, youll be able to up/downgrade to 10.1.1 on iPhone5s without jb. [and on his blogpost](URL &gt; My iPhone5s does not need a jailbreak, but all my other devices do need one. I tried an iPhone5s from a friend and his iPhone can't be downgraded without a jailbreak. **EDIT2** #TL;DR2 Prometheus has two methods to work 1. Generator method: Is a deterministic method which always works on a jailbreak with tfp0 2. Nonce Collision method: Is a non-deterministic method that *probably* works on some iPhone 5Ss and iPad Airs. * Jailbreaks that don't have tfp0 patch (iOS 9.0-9.0.2, 8.4 etc.) are NOT eligible for Prometheus. For example, if you have 9.1 or 8.1 you can use Prometheus. For others check if your jailbreak supports tfp0. * If you don't have these jailbreaks, then even if you have an iPhone 5S, it's NOT guaranteed to work with Prometheus. But if it works with your device, it doesn't even require your device to be jailbroken. That means to be on the safe side, * If you don't have a jailbreak with tfp0, update to 10.1.1 no matter what device you have."
132,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Discussion] [Question] [Request] Jailbreak idea,4,5akj1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5akj1z/discussion_question_request_jailbreak_idea/,2016-11-02 04:47:58,"Just a crazy idea and if I am misunderstanding somehow let me know. We can install iOS betas with profiles... How about we do that with jailbreaking? We could send a jailbreak and make the phone think it's an upgrade in the same way profiles install betas. If we need a key to allow the jailbreak to go through, then lets monitor network packets for upgrading iPhones and try to find it. EDIT: This could become an interesting conversation! To the people who said that it's not that simple, I knew that. It's kind of more of a kickstart onto the right path is what I was thinking. Surely there must be some way to imitate Apple servers, after all, they're still servers and the OS runs based on the servers being what they are. If we could find a way to imitate the Apple servers then they'd either have to rework the OTA thing (and that would require an iTunes upgrade!) or constantly scramble the keys. Of course this does mean that, in the wrong hands, info could be stolen and malware forced onto the phone. Maybe if we worked with Apple on an agreement: work for them and try to close every other possible vulnerability, and in return, they let us do this thing. I don't know. You take it from here. EDIT 2: How do SHSH (or whatever they are) blobs work? Are they for each individual device, each model, or each iPhone version (like the 7 plus as opposed to the 7)? I know they are different for different firmwares but... what else? I also have an iPod Touch 5 if we want to do experiments on it. 9.3.5. Even better- could we use the enterprise mode and create an intranet of Cydia and have things that way? Or use that tool and monitor the changes made in the OS versus the main one, then reverse engineer that? Another idea: does diags:// have any vulnerabilities?"

These vulnerabilities could be used to essentially jailbreak an iOS device without the user knowing and then install malware onto your device to intercept phone calls, emails, text messages etc. These vulns worked through web kit. Apple got word of them and quickly released iOS 9.3.5 patching up said vulns. Although we really haven't had anyone who has come forward with this malware (besides the guy that ""Lookout"" supposedly handled), this is interesting because a package was released that aimed to patch these holes up. Although, big surprise, it didn't actually fix the problem. It was really just another detection for the malware. It would attempt to delete said files off of your device if your device had been infected after you installed this tweak. If you already had the malware, it would just let you know that it tried to delete it but it wouldn't actually get rid of it because SpringBoard runs as mobile, not root. **So what now?** My question is now that this article is out and we know where the malware is somewhat, does this make it any easier to get a full patch out into the wild?

152,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Question] How can I trace the origin of my iTunes account hack?,29,4h1pm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/4h1pm2/question_how_can_i_trace_the_origin_of_my_itunes/,2016-04-30 07:50:20,"My account was compromised recently and some chinese guy reset my password, security questions, etc., and then drained my store credit on some chinese texas holdem gambling app. While it looks like I'm going to get the purchase reversed and get my account back (currently on phone with Apple tech support - now the billing department), I really want to figure out how this happened. Thing is, I don't know where to start. Since I jailbroke, my best guess is that it has likely been compromised through some tweak. * I have not installed any tweaks for a couple months. * The hack happened overnight, where for the first time in months I turned my iPad off (to replace the touch screen). Coincidence? Now, is it possible for a tweak to just get the iTunes password from the device, or does it require a key logger or fake sign in prompt? * In my case, I haven't entered or confirmed my iTunes password on my iPad for several weeks. I don't require it for free purchases, and I haven't really downloaded any apps for awhile. I basically just check email, watch late night comedy shows in safari, and use Feedly and YouTube, 99% of the time. My email account and such haven't had any attempt to breach them, but you know, a keylogger could make it vulnerable. I'm pretty sure the iTunes account would have gotten hacked because I installed some game cheat for gems or something, which is obviously a security issue. It could also have been any number of more legitimate tweaks. What this comes down to is this question: * How can I inspect various tweaks and/or daemons and their activity to potentially determine the probable culprit, and prevent any enduring vulnerability? I would also be grateful if anyone could share similar stories and how you addressed the issue. I don't want to lose my jailbreak, after all. (It's 9.0.2, on an oldish iPad 3.) Edit: My iTunes password is unique to my iTunes account. It's not associated with any other account registered anywhere else. "

154,vulnerability,jailbreak,[Discussion] Jailbreaking iOS 9.1 and 9.2,0,434if7,https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/434if7/discussion_jailbreaking_ios_91_and_92/,2016-01-29 05:12:44,"It's been frustrating waiting for Pangu and/or TaiG to announce an official jailbreak since 9.1 came out and broke Pangu's jailbreak. I totally understand why the like to keep silent (as to not stir up drama, to keep exploits secret, etc.), and I also understand why they play the waiting game (I believe it's because they want to make sure they release the jailbreak at a time where a maximum amount of people can get it since they are being paid for this). However, it has come to my attention that a glaring exploit has just been patched in iOS 9.2.1 (and actually OS X 10.11.3 as well, since the 2 platforms are not all that different under the hood). In particular, I am referring to CVE-2016-1722, which was briefly discussed on Apple's security page giving the updates about what 9.2.1 has patched: URL CVE-2016-1722 is listed as a vulnerability in syslogd, a program that is part of both iOS and OS X. On Apple's website, the ""impact"" of the exploit is that ""a local user may be able to execute arbitrary code with root privileges"". I decided to do some more digging on the matter and found that the security team who discovered the exploit posted a blog entry with a much more detailed explanation, pointing to the specific source code that is affected: URL Now, I've just recently learned C, but the exploit they pointed out here is quite a classic case of how to write unsafe software in C (which is also an inherently unsafe language since it has direct access to a computer's memory). It's basically just a PEMDAS screw up; they forgot to put the parentheses around the right numbers! Anyways, I digressed a little, but my point is that this exploit is clearly available on iOS 9.1 and 9.2, it seems like a solid way to jailbreak devices, so maybe instead of just waiting for TaiG and Pangu to jailbreak 9.3 (or whatever will be next), maybe it is possible to use this exploit to jailbreak it without an ""official"" jailbreak release. I am not an expert in security testing nor do I (currently) know how to jailbreak an iDevice once a vulnerability has been discovered, but I was hoping that maybe /r/jailbreak had some input on the idea of developing some kind of ""community jailbreak"" so for those of us waiting patiently on 9.1 and 9.2 can jailbreak again. So, does anyone here know how to proceed when such a vulnerability is found? Do you guys like this idea of trying to put together a jailbreak for 9.1 and 9.2? Let me know what you all think. TL;DR: there's a gaping vulnerability in 9.1 and 9.2 and no JB tool released, lets JB it ourselves!"

New developments had been coming up left and right... and there it was. iOS 11.4-11.4.1 Jailbreak out now! It was an incredible sight, seeing people jailbreak their devices even when hope seemed so far away. Such a rush seeing the commenters discuss an upcoming iOS 12 jailbreak and Pwn20wnd telling people what versions to be ready on for said jailbreak. It was like the ecstasy of tasting your first Five Guys burger, your first addicting game you played, on and on. I felt a change in me that day... a dependence on information.

Alas, I began to embrace my desire. It seemed that every chance I got, I was checking r/jailbreak for something new, hoping to see that post iOS 12-12.1.2 Jailbreak out now! It began to consume me and all of my attention to the point that I felt the need to share my story, to bring awareness to this addiction that I feel I share with many other eager souls. I share these things to say that I am incredibly excited for this jailbreak. I am ready for a new jailbreak to fuel my addiction for this subreddit even more.

I greatly respect the developers need to take their time on making the jailbreak tools and thank them greatly for taking any time at all to work on this for the community.
