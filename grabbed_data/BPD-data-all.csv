I want to thank you all for sharing your vulnerability. I find myself in tears reading each and every post realizing *holy shit Im not the only one*... still in the process of becoming unashamed of having BPD, but seeing and reading about our community has helped me from dissociating as much. So thank you all for sharing and for making this a much less lonely world for us"
1,vulnerability,BPD,DAE go back and forth between idealizing and devaluing your SO/FP and feel guilty about it? Am I self-sabotaging?,1,i69siv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/i69siv/dae_go_back_and_forth_between_idealizing_and/,2020-08-09 10:10:33,"Long story short: my Bf and I are in a good place in our relationship right now, but the past few months..even years have been rocky. I know Im not the easiest to deal with, having BPD and all but I try my best. Over the course of almost 4 years of being together theres been some questionable things hes done that I still cant get over (not outright cheating but definitely not loyal and lied/hid shit from me). And it would be a cycle of me finding out, him apologizing, me struggling to deal with it...only to find out something else hes done. Last month things were super bad, we were arguing so much and it took so many night of fighting and crying to get to the point where he he genuinely wanted to be better and for things to work out between us. Since then, hes been really good at giving me reassurance, validating my feelings and reminding me its okay to be upset at him for the things hes done, and hes been doing whatever he can to get my trust back. The other day in a moment of giddiness and vulnerability I told him that I felt like I was happy for the first time in a long time with our relationship, that I felt like I was in the honeymoon stage again. He said he was really glad I felt that way and he hoped things would continue to get better. A few days have passed and now I feel like I let my guard down too early and I shouldnt have said those things. Im home alone atm and when that happens I start spiraling thinking intrusive thoughts about the things hes said and done to me before and Ive pretty much split on him at this point. I dont want to fight anymore and I hate that I ruminate about all the bad things when Im alone or not with him. I feel guilty because hes done nothing wrong at the moment but Im still really hurt and angry. At him and at myself, like why cant I just get over things like a normal person? Like I said, since then hes sincerely apologized and is genuinely trying to make our relationship work. Am I just self sabotaging? We were supposed to go out and get food together today, but I told him I didnt want to go anymore and that I was kind of upset. He tried to call me and text me and he told me he hoped I was okay and that he was coming over, but I said not to, and that I didnt feel like talking right now. Ive really been trying to believe him that hes changed and that he really is sorry for the things hes done so Ive been trying to not be so obsessive about the past and just move on. But theres still so much hurt and anger and now Ive pushed him away. Splitting is so tiring. To go from being completely in love with someone to feeling absolute hatred and rage all the time is exhausting. Im tired."
2,vulnerability,BPD,Adults with bpd- whos found that the best way to manage your disorder is to learn to be apathetic about EVERYTHING?,1,ib4578,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ib4578/adults_with_bpd_whos_found_that_the_best_way_to/,2020-08-17 10:46:02,"Been on this tip for a while now, this sort of 50/50 split between the letting go of eastern philosophical traditions, and the embrace of nihilism, the idea that life is inherently meaningless so you can stop frantically trying to make sense of everything. I think the two have more in common than easily strikes most people because eastern religions have vastly better marketing, but learning to think this way has been incredibly helpful for me. I arrived at this place after decades of helplessly being unable to make progress in my life or change relationship patterns, after watching thing after thing after thing that I cared about in my life fall apart and being unable to deal with my emotional reactions to those events or the reactions of others to my reactions and just having to live within this never ending tornado of absolute chaos with no support whatsoever. Im at the point now where support of any kind is actually uncomfortable for me because nobody could possibly give me the amount that I need. So I just have to check out of the whole game completely before the relationship collapses under an amount of weight that no healthy relationship could ever support. After decades of living on this hamster wheel of hell I finally accepted that I had no control over it all and reached a deep understanding that embracing the void was the only option. Just letting go of caring or being invested in what happened to me or what people thought of me and letting go of any lingering delusions I was still holding onto that I would ever be really known. It took me until my mid thirties to find a hack for what I think would otherwise have been an unsolvable problem, and I truly believe that Ive stumbled onto something substantial. I havent thoroughly explored dbt although I understand that its very mindfulness based, and I do think that mindfulness is a very useful tool in dealing with bpd in general- helping people to find their center, interrupt unhealthy patterns and temper emotional reactions- so it all kind of checks out. But Im curious how many other adults arrived at a similar conclusion that letting go of any chance of emotional intimacy or vulnerability or investment and just embracing a kind of zen detachment towards everything was the best path towards emotional control. I tend to believe I might be unique in terms of what makes relationships especially challenging for me, I have suspicions that there might be some mild autism mixed in somewhere that obscures any lingering chance I might otherwise have had at being truly seen by another human, so maybe this is an extreme reaction that wouldnt be necessary for most people. I get the sense from reading other peoples posts here that a lot of borderlines have a lot of loving supportive relationships in their lives which is lovely but also very confusing to me. Im glad the disorder has been less isolating for others than its been for me, but intimate relationships are pretty much completely out of the question for me at this point. I know this sub is mostly composed of a younger demographic, they seem to lack some of the mental health stigma that afflicted older generations and thats amazing. But I am curious to hear from older members who arrived at a similar conclusion or have experimented with complete emotional detachment from life as a way to manage their disorder. You could call it giving up on life or you could call it enlightened, and I honestly dont know which to call it or if it even makes a difference. But I swear when I refrain from getting invested in anything I dont even have a disorder and I dont hate that feeling."
3,vulnerability,BPD,How far should I go ? Polyamorous relationship with BPD,1,ibfudc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ibfudc/how_far_should_i_go_polyamorous_relationship_with/,2020-08-18 01:06:49,"A year ago, I (32M) entered a polyamorous relationship with someone (30F) with BPD. We have been friends and then FWBs. After being on/off with her Ex, she finally decided to end that relationship and entered into a polyamorous arrangement with me. She has experienced tremendous amount of trauma in her past relationship including double abortion, abuse (physical and to an extent sexual) etc. So, we both decided that a change of place would do her good. End of last year, she moved to a new city in the hope of starting a new life. Knowing her condition and having been there when she experienced all of that, I decided to devote myself to her. She had some savings but I also helped her out financially to move such as paying lease, buying furniture etc. Apart from financial support, I tried to be there for emotional support. I would constantly text her, do video calls, cheer her up when she feel low etc. This is apart from educating myself about BPD to be able to help her. Every person is different. However, through her experience and past behaviors we decided to set some boundarys in our relationship. These were no alcohol, limited or no interactions with men outside of professional sphere and old friends. This was temporary. The reasoning was that she can often get emotional and lonely which makes her vulnerable. And in that vulnerability if she seeks men, things get intimate. More often, those men would leave. She would then feel used, loathe herself and fall into depression. And, I would be left to pick up the pieces. So, we agreed on some stricter boundaries. One way we enforced it by introducing a S/M dynamics. We both agreed that until she is fully capable of making her own decisions, she would ask permission for most stuff. This was working quite well for a time. She started going to therapy, enrolled into gym, started learning a language and blogging on social media. Coming to the sad part. It turns out she was not being fully honest. The whole idea of seeking permission was to ensure that I could be her inner voice and stop her from making the same mistakes. But she did make mistakes. One thing she continued despite my disagreement was to talk with men. She agreed to let me look into her personal chat so that I could stop her if she was getting too attached. However, when I did point out some issues, she would get low and depressed. In certain situations, she would use her depression and low mood to get what she wanted. So, I did allow her some freedom thinking that she was doing better. It included interacting with some men online, making new male friends, going out with them etc. She kept defending her relationship with men saying they were only friends until she invited one of her friend, got drunk and intimate. Her cousin lives with her and she told me about it. When I gave her the chance to come clean, at first she denied the whole thing. She admitted that she drank with him but nothing happened. After an hour of making her understand that it was okay, she confessed. When I had asked her in the past about that guy, she said she was not sexually attracted to him or that he did not like her that way. The truth is she never mentioned to him she was in a polyamorous relationship. When I looked at her chat with that guy from beginning, I found that he was clearly hitting on her. A lot of other things came out e.g. she has been having one of her other friend over sometimes which she never mentioned to me. She continue to stick to her story that nothing happened with him either. She had stopped hanging out with him when this guys wife, yeah he was married, called out on her and creating a big scene. Later, seeing that she was not going to stop unless she felt she should, we opened up our relationship. I should mention that it was over long distance. I wanted to know what she really wants. She told me that  hooking up while keeping it from me was more interesting than me agreeing to it.  So, she finally hooked up with that friend with whom she got intimate. He then left for his hometown after a few days leaving her behind. Then she met a couple of guys from Tinder and hooked up with the second one. Even here, we had agreed that she first dates them and see if a platonic relationship is enough. But, she got drunk again with the new guy and slept with him. She hooked up with a few times more. One day, she was feeling really low and depressed. She called him to come over for support. That led to sex as well. But afterwards, the guy told her that he did not want her responsibility. In the mean while, her hooking up with other men affected me. May be some would say, being poly I have no right. But, it was like, after guys are done with her, I have to pick up the pieces. On top of that, when I told her I wanted to be just friends and she can then have her freedom, she had an emotional breakdown. She cut her wrist. Not deep. People here would probably know. In the end, we discussed and agreed that she stops. She understands partially that as long as she is dependent on men for emotional support, she can never become independent or be able to have a successful relationship. I could not walk out completely because there is nobody in her life including family and friends who can truly support her. They dont even accept that she has BPD. So, I have decided to stay and try to rebuild the relationship. But, I am afraid of two things How can I trust her to be honest with me ? How far should I go because I care for her ? Is she being selfish because I have promised her a future with me and I provide her financial support ? Before she moved to the city and we were planning to meet, she had hooked up with another guy. So, i dont know if she can really stop. Its like she is addicted to this need of wanting someone around. If she were independent and able to take care of herself, I would not mind her having other partners. Instead that is what we discussed in the beginning of our relationship that she was willing to choose once she has become better. Right now, it feels like she is unable to choose and is driven by her need/addiction. I dont know what I am looking for here. It would be nice to hear some views or if someone has experienced something similar. I apologize for the long post."

I guess its like I want to show that I have slept with this many people as experienced or just as a flex?, but I know that I will later use it as a way to make myself feel shameful after. Because I know ill say things like wow this isnt a flex, youre just a pathetic whore etc, but for right now I want to do it? I want to have a high body count as a way to validate myself and how much i am seen as attractive? Does anyone else feel this way? Thanks in advance"
5,vulnerability,BPD,Struggling,1,hl2q0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/hl2q0u/struggling/,2020-07-04 22:43:01,"About two months ago my (21F) ex (24M) who I am 99% certain has covert narcissistic personality disorder left. I felt sad and angry at first but I eventually started to feel lighter and grateful that it ended early. Im thankful I didnt lose my virginity to him as I feel as if I wouldve gotten even more attached. And believe me I was already extremely attached. He was always reserved and distant and I became clingy. We had a very intense, but extremely unstable relationship. It caused me a lot of pain as the rational part of me saw all that was wrong but I still didnt want to let go and lose this intense feeling of having someone to love so deeply. We were together for a month last August and I fell for him really quickly and it felt like he did too. I got attached to him in literally only four days and we talked all the time. He was the first guy I felt this way about. Ive had crushes on people and been attracted but it was never this deep and one day I would just stop liking and thinking about them. He showered me with compliments and attention. He would send me songs. This I have to note: I feel like I have been able to build some confidence through the years but the only reason for that is sad. The only reason I started to feel less self-hate is because I received a lot of external validation for my appearance due to being conventionally attractive. I started getting a lot of attention from men and sometimes other girls from the age of 16 onwards. My ex always commented on my appearance, I worried that that was the only part of me that had value and worthy of being praised or loved. And then one day out of the blue, all of his anxieties and insecurities came to ruin it. He said he worried about the distance (we only lived 50km apart), he told me he didnt feel the same way, and that he wasnt in a good place for a relationship. He coldly discarded me while attempting to string me along for a few more days. And then after that I thought it was all over. I thought Id never hear from him again. And I never attempted to contact him again either because I didnt want to make a fool of myself and get hurt again even though I badly wanted him back. I was shocked by how suddenly he changed his mind. My fear of abandonment had once again been fulfilled. I cried for weeks. I felt intensely sad and very much still in love for months. I tried to go on with my life but I struggled, my grades slipped slightly but I still managed to do alright. But I just couldnt get him out of my mind, I couldnt forget what he made me feel. I still fear Ill never feel it again. No one had that effect on me. Every time I thought I was over him, it would always come back to haunt me. Four months later I downloaded tinder (where we first met) and tried dating other guys, and they were all so nice and stable, and I just couldnt get into it. After this episode, I tried really hard to move on even though I was still deeply hurting. I had stopped crying all the time but I felt empty and my heart felt physically heavy. I forced myself to accept that he would never come back. And then he did. I downloaded tinder again and 20 mins later I saw that he liked me on there. I was extremely shocked and shaken by this, I didnt know what to do, but I did know for sure that I just couldnt ignore him because I still had feelings for him (nowhere near as intensely as before because itd been half a year since we last spoke) but they were still real. So I matched with him four days later and I messaged him on midnight saying that I remembered it was his birthday and I still remembered. He messaged back early in the morning thanking me for remembering and said he was very sorry about last time and he realized he fucked up, and that Im a keeper and hes glad he found me again. (It still hurts so much to look back and remember these words, every time he leaves all I can remember is the good things and not all the times he hurt me for whatever reason). He said, I really want to be with you, and I believed him because this was the first time he showed me some vulnerability. So I took him back. He said he was willing to make the four hour drive and pick me up and drop me back home (im a student so I dont have a car or much money, he does and has a steady job however) just so we could be together. He also had his own place now (he lived with his brother before another reason for ending it last time for him, he said he wanted privacy) and he was absolutely ecstatic. He told me he loved me and that he was hoping I was the one for him. (Keep in mind hes dated about a dozen girls in the past, longest being for a year and claims to have slept with 20 women). This I knew very early on and I did have an uneasy feeling as it came across as a red flag but I ignored it/didnt care much. We were in the honeymoon phase all over again. It lasted about only two weeks. One day it all started to click with me. I never noticed the signs before but after researching it all made sense. He had so many traits of covert narcissism. I didnt have the courage to end it so I decided to just delay meeting in person. (I have no idea why my thought process was so nonsensical I never had much of an endgame though). I told him that I didnt want to have sex with him until he got tested. (I knew hes had unprotected sex with a few girls in the past two years). I was legitimately concerned with catching an std because of his sexual history. I thought he wouldnt have a problem getting tested because he told me he loved me and cared about me, and I thought it must have been true because he was so invested and was willing to spend all that time and money to drive and be with me, despite having more convenient options, right? Instead he of course lashed out at me for not trusting him and said that this stupid shit was keeping us apart. And from that point I became disgusted with him, I just stopped having that idealized view. (I never regarded him as perfect its just that I always viewed him as amazing in so many ways and lucky that he chose me). He said he wanted to see me really badly but now he was getting frustrated and very annoyed with me. We fell out of the intense elation of course. I still reached out to him the next day telling him that I still was in this and asking if he was too. He said he was and that if I wanted to be with him I should just see him without all this other shit and just go with the flow. I decided to stop pushing the testing out of fear of him getting too frustrated and just leaving so I started using corona as an excuse. One day I just got fed up and told him that he should go and find someone else wholl have raw sex with him (oh yeah he always wanted it raw with me and loved talking about my tight pussy. He said he didnt like condoms because he didnt perform well with them and couldnt feel much or enjoy sex. I likely think it was because he watches porn daily and masturbates with a really firm grip once or twice a day). He didnt waver and said okay. I felt deeply disturbed that I was the reason for losing him this time and asked for him to come back. He told me he would as long as I didnt bring up testing again. I didnt like this but I agreed out of weakness for him anyway. We got into a lot of arguments and we never did end up meeting too. He eventually discarded me because he became really angry at me for messaging his friend on Instagram asking questions about him. I became really obsessed with finding answers and couldnt understand why I had such an unhealthy attachment to him while knowing hes bad for me and even attempting to leave him. Every day I began to see more and more signs of manipulation and his covert narcissism. He messaged me at the end of May, three weeks after our breakup asking who I messaged about him. He claimed that some people were not responding to him and were ignoring him now. I still havent responded. I know with the way hes worded this hes trying to make me feel guilty and I even do feel it a little bit. I have a strong feeling hes lying because the three girls I messaged all said they never talked to him and only knew him from school. I know hes been on dating apps for a bit now so it could be that he was ultimately unsuccessful with finding a pretty girl wholl have raw sex with him with no questions asked and hes just trying to suck me back in. People in narc abuse survivor circles say that you should never respond to their Hoover attempts, but what if you just feel incomplete without closure? I havent decided how to respond, Im afraid of what hell say and at the same time a part of me doesnt want to close that chapter forever. In researching, all of his behaviour and finally understanding it. I came across BPD and I realized today that I matched many of the diagnostic criteria. It all makes sense now. I dont want to use this disorder as a way to excuse the emotional problems Ive had and inflicted into other people and I want to get better. It all makes sense now. The intense emotions, the instability, the idealization and splitting, the obsessiveness, the clinginess etc. I dont want to believe that Im a bad person. I know I am flawed but one thing I can be proud of is that I have intense empathy and have never taken joy from someone elses pain. Ive given to charity without a second thought. Ive always tried to help people where I could. I care deeply about others suffering even if they are strangers. But at the same time Ive lashed out emotionally and hurt the people close to me because of my instability. I always realize quickly after the fact how I hurt them and feel extremely guilty and ashamed. I always reach out and apologize because I just cant live with myself and hate myself so much. I want to be loved but I feel so unworthy of real love. I now understand what was so broken in me to love my ex. Im still struggling with him and I dont know how to move on truly. Right now Ive hit a really low point in realizing how broken I am, almost everyone close to me has abandoned me and Ive never felt more alone. I feel so empty. But Ive always felt empty. I have to deal with feelings of regular heartbreak plus all the heavy emotions that come with realizing you have this problem. How do normal people do it? Can I be normal one day too? Is there hope for me? Thank you to anyone who reads this, I hope to hear from people in my position. Id really appreciate any insight on him especially, our relationship, and my issues."

I became really obsessed with finding answers and couldnt understand why I had such an unhealthy attachment to him while knowing hes bad for me and even attempting to leave him. Every day I began to see more and more signs of manipulation and his covert narcissism. He messaged me at the end of May, three weeks after our breakup asking who I messaged about him. He claimed that some people were not responding to him and were ignoring him now. I still havent responded. I know with the way hes worded this hes trying to make me feel guilty and I even do feel it a little bit. I have a strong feeling hes lying because the three girls I messaged all said they never talked to him and only knew him from school. I know hes been on dating apps for a bit now so it could be that he was ultimately unsuccessful with finding a pretty girl wholl have raw sex with him with no questions asked and hes just trying to suck me back in. People in narc abuse survivor circles say that you should never respond to their Hoover attempts, but what if you just feel incomplete without closure? I havent decided how to respond, Im afraid of what hell say and at the same time a part of me doesnt want to close that chapter forever. In researching, all of his behaviour and finally understanding it. I came across BPD and I realized today that I matched many of the diagnostic criteria. It all makes sense now. I dont want to use this disorder as a way to excuse the emotional problems Ive had and inflicted into other people and I want to get better. It all makes sense now. The intense emotions, the instability, the idealization and splitting, the obsessiveness, the clinginess etc. I dont want to believe that Im a bad person. I know I am flawed but one thing I can be proud of is that I have intense empathy and have never taken joy from someone elses pain. Ive given to charity without a second thought. Ive always tried to help people where I could. I care deeply about others suffering even if they are strangers. I was physically abused as a child (not sexually at all) by my parents but I think thats more because of their culture and they stopped after an intervention after seeing how badly it affected me and they never did it again. I was bullied at school when I was younger but that stopped too. But Ive insulted people when I was younger too but I felt so bad about it I never did it after childhood. Im not immune to others suffering because of the pain I felt in my life. And I dont want others to feel that way. I performed really well academically and based my self worth on my achievements. I became very fixated on my appearance when I started getting compliments and attention. I feel like I have such a contradictory sense of ego, I have experienced intense self-hatred in the past which I have managed to lessen but at the same time I feel like Im better than others because it looks and intelligence and care a lot about status and being with a guy on my level. I dont want to feel this anymore. Ive lashed out emotionally and hurt the people close to me because of my instability. I never have and would never intentionally use someone for my own needs. I have acted selfishly and lashed out in anger but I always feel bad afterwards. I always realize quickly after the fact how I hurt them and feel extremely guilty and ashamed. I always reach out and apologize because I just cant live with myself and hate myself so much. I want to be loved but I feel so unworthy of real love. I now understand what was so broken in me to love my ex. Im still struggling with him and I dont know how to move on truly. Right now Ive hit a really low point in realizing how broken I am, almost everyone close to me has abandoned me and Ive never felt more alone. I feel so empty. But Ive always felt empty. I have to deal with feelings of regular heartbreak plus all the heavy emotions that come with realizing you have this problem. How do normal people do it? Can I be normal one day too? Is there hope for me? Thank you to anyone who reads this, I hope to hear from people in my position. Id really appreciate any insight on him especially, our relationship, my issues, and how should respond to him."
8,vulnerability,BPD,Hi...I am a codependent love addict... and I think a lot of pwBPD may be too.,1,hpd222,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/hpd222/hii_am_a_codependent_love_addict_and_i_think_a/,2020-07-12 02:38:12,"As the title states, I am a codependent love addict and I think a lot of pwBPD may be too. A few weeks back I was listening to a podcast, The Mental Illness Happy Hour, and they had a guest on who was talking about being a love addict and they recommended a book, Facing Love Addiction by Pia Mellody. I decided to order it since a lot of what she described in her experiences sounded like me. My attraction to unavailable men most specifically but also the cycles in my relationships and the things I do to manipulate people into loving me but being terrified of receiving actual love cause I know Ill just ruin it and hurt anyone who tries to really love me so I am not only a Love Addict but also Love Avoidant. Sound familiar to anyone else? Im only half way through this book and Ive never read anything that has better explained why I think and feel and act the ways I do in my relationships better. This book talks a lot about childhood abandonment, abuse and emotional neglect and how that affects our self esteem and our adult relationships and the partners we pick. Ive also learned that I am extremely codependent and I think a lot of pwBPD can relate to this. The book describes the Core Symptoms of codependence as: 1. Difficulty experiencing appropriate levels of self esteem, that is to say difficulty loving ones self. 2. Difficulty setting functional boundaries with other people, that is to say, difficulty protecting ones self. 3. Difficulty owning ones own reality appropriately, that is to say, difficulty identifying who one is and knowing how to share that appropriately with others. 4. Difficulty addressing interdependently ones adult needs and wants, that is to say, difficulty with self care. 5. Difficulty experiencing and expressing ones reality in moderation, that is to say, difficulty being appropriate for ones age and various circumstances. (Oversharing) These core symptoms lead to secondary symptoms that negatively affect our relationships with others. Secondary symptoms.... 1. Negative Control: either trying to control others by telling them who they ought to be so the codependent is comfortable or allowing others to control the codependents by dictating who they should be to keep others comfortable. Either form of negative control sets up negative responses in the person being controlled and these negative responses cause the codependent to blame others for their own inability to be internally comfortable with themselves. ( hello identity issues) 2. Resentment: codependents use resentment as a futile way to try to protect themselves and regain self esteem. When people are victimized they experience two things rather intensely: a drop in self esteem, value and a profound need to find some way to stop the victimization. Anger gives people a sense of power and energy to protect ones self. But when we recycle the anger and combine it with an obsession about punishing the offender or getting revenge we enter into resentment. Resentment debilitates the codependent because of the process of replaying the victimization in our minds which brings on painful emotions such as shame, unexpressed or poorly expressed anger and depressive frustration. Resentment plays a key part in the way codependents lives are hampered by blaming others for their own inability to protect themselves with healthy boundaries. (Hello BPD Rage) 3. Impaired Spirituality: codependents either make someone else their Higher Power through hate, fear, worship or attempt to be anothers Higher Power. (Hello favorite person I cant live without) 4. Addictions, or mental or physical illness: our ability to face reality is directly related to our ability to have a healthy relationship with ourself which means loving the self, protecting the self, identifying the self, caring for the self and moderating the self. When we do not acquire a functional internal relationship and sense of adequacy, the pain that results inside of us and in our relationships with others and with our Higher Power (FP) often leads us into an addictive process to alleviate the pain quickly. ( Hello drug, sex, self harm, shopping, food, and any other addictions you can think of) 5. Difficulty with intimacy: intimacy involves sharing our own reality and receiving the reality of others without either party judging that reality or trying to change it. Codependents with the core symptom of difficulty identifying who they are( their reality) and sharing appropriately cannot be intimate in a healthy way, since intimacy means sharing their reality. Without the sharing of healthy intimacy, codependents cannot check out their immature perceptions and they continue to have painful problems in their relationships with others. ( Hello my inability to show people who I really am for fear of being rejected and abandoned) Three characteristics of a Love Addict. 1. Love addicts assign a disproportionate amount of time, attention, and value above themselves to the person whom they are addicted, and this focus often has an obsessive quality about it. ( hello favorite person, you are all that matters) 2. Love addicts have unrealistic expectations for unconditional positive regard from the other person in the relationship. ( Please never change your tone of voice or show any sign of not loving me even after I have an episode and split on you) 3. Love addicts neglect to care for or value themselves while in a relationship. ( I am so much more stable while alone and a complete psychotic mess when in a relationship) I wont continue to recite the whole book but if you relate to any of this I suggest you go buy it. I plan on reading her book about codependency next. Mostly I just wanted to share because this book is really opening my eyes to how my childhood abuse and neglect has made me feel unworthy of love and so I have smothered people who loved me, chased men who only want to use me and all because I wasnt loved the way I needed as a child. My alcoholic mother hates me, she physically and emotionally abused me throughout my life and now we are estranged. My dad abandoned us for another woman and left me to be abused by my alcoholic mother and then he died of a drug overdose when I was a teen. I was then left to caretake my little brother who is a psychopath while my oldest sister went to a prestigious college. Im a high school drop out by the way and was in no way equip to raise a child but I sacrificed my 20s working shitty jobs to take care of him only for him to abuse me the whole time. I was in an intense relationship for over 10 years to a great guy who had his own issues and I think I smothered and tried to control him and eventually I made him not love me anymore. He then started to abuse and control me and I let him because I couldnt survive without him. He was my everything. I had no identity without him. And then he cheated and dumped me and left me with absolutely nothing and ruined my credit. Then to deal with that pain I got involved in an affair with a married man who obsessively loves me but has no plans to be with me. Deep down I know this isnt love. Im sure I manipulated him into loving me in some way or maybe he wants to pretend to be my savior or something. He loves my intensity, my obsession, my eagerness to please in bed, my Ill do anything to make you love me mindset. I also think he loves my honesty, vulnerability and pain, but I dont think he really loves me in a healthy way and despite what he says I will always be less than his wife. ( I know Im a piece of shit for this, I feel like a garbage human being for taking his love and I am sorry). Im trying to change. I really am. I guess I just wanted to share this to get it out and hope that some one else relates. I know Im fucked up. I know I am damaged and I dont feel worthy of someone truly loving me because I have nothing to offer anyone but I hope one day I wont feel like this anymore. I hope one day I wont have to settle for being 2nd to someones wife and enduring all the pain and shame that brings. I hope one day I will be stable enough to have a healthy relationship with proper boundaries and mutual respect without it engulfing me or forcing me to be someone I am not. Mostly I just want to feel loved and accepted for who I am and I guess that has to start with me."
9,vulnerability,BPD,"i've always struggled with how fear and love, coercion and affection, seem to go hand in hand in romantic relationships. so I dove into it...",1,hpq2ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/hpq2ek/ive_always_struggled_with_how_fear_and_love/,2020-07-12 16:53:06,"Something I've always resonated with in descriptions of BPD is the sensitivity to slight changes in tone or facial expression, especially for romantic partners for me. At an intellectual level I realize it doesn't necessarily mean all the things I'm automatically assuming it to mean, but underneath there is so much fear being generated by a very traumatized part it is hard to think and to rationally see what's happening and separate it from the trauma. It's created a lot of unintentional power and control dynamics with my partners. I realized that I hadn't really let that part of me experiencing the fear say their piece, say why they felt this way. I'd always labeled it as something to be corrected, not validated. But tonight for some reason I got really curious about this part. And it was actually really cathartic to let them speak their truth! Maybe because it's in second person, maybe because I've never really allowed this part of me to say their piece fully, and I'm finally in a place where I've acquired enough self compassion to really hold them in all that this part of me is, with love, and without shame. If anyone else feels this way in relationships, I just want you to know I see you &amp; you're not alone. &lt;3 \--- CW for abuse Reading back our messages -- those first couple months (up until November) were so intoxicating. God fucking damn. Im so not over how the way we communicated has changed so much in the past 6 months. Brain experiences it as so, so, fucked up. I read those old messages and I feel so much pain. What did I do wrong. Where did we go wrong. How could I have prevented this. I just want to go back to those times. When everything felt possible. When we trusted each other. When you trusted me. Cant interpret it as anything other than punishment. Cant convince myself it means anything else than that Ive failed. (It would help of course if you told me the role your trauma or other factors played in how this played out.) So hard to believe how differently weve been communicating in the past couple weeks. Like strangers. Or acquaintances. A sense of relief to know that even when we were being affectionate, at least starting in September, part of that was desperation on my end. Relief that it wasnt so different then. Didnt want to believe the impact they were having, it made no sense. Wanted their approval, craved it like a drug. Every emoji, every term of endearment, every affirmation. Like dopamine directly to my brain. Saying you are good, so you are loved. How do I integrate such different experiences of the same relationship? No more. In the future, no more ignoring my feelings and repressing them. That has caused enough pain. No more suffering silently so someone else can feel good. No more tone policing. No more sugarcoating. No more pretending things are okay when they arent. No more trying desperately to get someones approval like a circus monkey. No more forcing myself to like what they like just to get that hit. Do you want this, do you want that? Just to get a hit. &lt; younger part talking starts here, so there's a lot of projection of past trauma onto current events &gt; The problem with the hit is that it makes everything feel okay, just for a moment. It makes the existential anxiety go away. It makes me believe theres nothing wrong and everythings resolved. It makes me feel safe. It feels like a promise that theyll always be with me, even though I know that isnt true. It feels soothing. Like being rocked to sleep. Someone telling me, you matter. I care about you. I care that youre happy or sad. I think youre valuable. I want whats best for you. It feels so good. And it feels so good to be of use to someone in that same way. That I can be something for them. It feels so good. It feels like what Ive trained for my whole life. The people pleasing part of me craves it all day every day like a drug and will annihilate anything that stands in the way of getting that hit, including standing up for myself. Or saying what I really feel. It will do anything to keep that connection going including apologizing. Pfft, whats an apology in the face of that sweet hit? That person telling me, youre special and youre safe with me. I adore you. I admire you. I think youre cool. Everything encapsulated so neatly, the answer to all of my problems. I feel good when I make you feel good. I will do anything for it. I will be anything you want me to be. I will say what you want me to say. And when its taken away? It feels like death. It feels like someone is suffocating me. I am fourteen again, and my parents are telling me that I do everything wrong. Now its you. Youre saying, Youre bad, look at what youve done. Stop doing it. You think youre special? Youre nothing. Youre replaceable. You dont deserve my affection, attention, or explanation. I cant breathe. That small sense of self Ive carefully developed in the last couple years just smolders away and Im consumed by a blaze of fear. I blame myself, automatically, with fervor, with enthusiasm, so that I can get on your right side again. Whats a little blame, anyway? I probably deserve it. Just to err on the safe side, its probably my fault and I should apologize. It must be my fault. Thats the only way it can be resolved. ""Can't you see how you've fucked up? It's so obvious. I'll stay this way and watch you squirm and suffer until you apologize."" In these moments I can feel your disdain and anger and hatred at me. It's more real than anything. I can't think of anything else. I cant bear it. I cant. It feels like death. In my head I flash back, see my mothers face and I know Im less than a bug to her, even if she wont say it. That look of contempt. You deserve this. You deserve to feel bad. Of course when my mother does it I resist it. I drop it onto an existing pile of hate and resentment. But when you love someone, when you truly love someone, you stop resisting. You give in to what they want. There is no other way. So I gave in. Because that look on your face, that change of tone in your texts -- it implies everything. (So why do I still feel resentment?) I search for what to apologize for. I always come up with something. How can I explain what a switch from affectionate to neutral does to my brain? Its like getting kicked in the face. Its like my world is collapsing. Its like you have all the power in the world, suddenly, to make me feel terrible in a second. And youre aware of that power. And Im aware of that power. And I realize suddenly my vulnerability, my lack of power. Im completely at your mercy. You know that I know that if I ever want to get you back, the side that loves me and is affectionate, I need to follow the script. Im supposed to figure out whats wrong, and apologize. I need to follow the script or Im never going to get you back. Youll be stuck this way, and itll be my fault. Youll discard me and I will have deserved it. Ill never experience your love again. ""Its over, its over, its over,"" youre saying without speaking a single word. ""It's so cute how you're struggling."" You have me in the palm of your hand and you can take it all away in a second. (Cant you see that?) (Why are you doing this to me?) Im terrified of you. That switch could happen at any moment, so I do whatever it takes to prevent it. I learn everything that you like and mimic it exactly. I only stick to safe topics. I know exactly what makes you laugh. What gets you in a good mood. Your most favoritest things you like to do together. What you like sexually. I want to like all of those things too. I want to give you what you want, forever. (And, to be fair, I love making you laugh.) I want to make you happy. When Im with you that is my only goal and when I succeed, I feel happy too. I compulsively compliment you and express how lucky I am to be with you. And its true, at some level. You are, I am, completely safe as long as I dont fuck up. Im terrified of you. And I cant decouple the terror from the love. From feeling safe. Safety is only ever conditional, I know that. Conditional on my ability to perform, to apologize and be sorry for what Ive done. Conditional on me feeling shame and guilt and fear. But maybe, maybe If I just do everything perfectly Ill finally be everything you want. And Ill get that hit. "

More apologies about how he didn't feel good enough for me, how he didn't feel like talking to anyone, how he told his family about me and they twisted all my actions and words into trash. Poisoning his mind, hurting the both of us, slandering BPD. I haven't heard from him in two days. I assume it's over. I know it *should* be, if he ever does decide to reply. I do deserve more stability. It's hard to not write off all the sweet gestures, all the vulnerability he showed, as emotional manipulation. It's hard not to feel like a piece of me is missing...I've only known him for two months. I've only met him once. Yet, I felt like I had lost myself. No more. Please no more. I can't handle losing my identity again, losing my trust in others, in my judgement. I can handle people walking out. But I will not walk out on myself when they do."

This is difficult because my friends share a lot about their difficulties in life. Now I'm overjoyed when they do and It doesn't bother me to help them carry their burdens. However, an important part of vulnerability is reciprocity. My question is, how do reciprocate when my internal issues are so unreasonable and repetitive? On one hand, I don't want them to know exactly how irational and repetitive they are. On the other, I don't want to them to feel the helplessness of knowing you can't stop that pain."

It can be a calming and loving experience. However for some, to have that connection and vulnerability to get hurt will scare the shit out of them.

Someday someone will be open to receiving and reciprocating the love you have to offer and unafraid to be their authentic self with you.

13,vulnerability,BPD,A call for some creative help from you beautiful people!,1,i17iir,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/i17iir/a_call_for_some_creative_help_from_you_beautiful/,2020-07-31 23:28:50,"What up, fellow Borderliners? So, here's the crux of it: BPD representation in the creative world - movie characters, book characters, TV characters etc etc - is, let's face it, absolutely shit. There's almost nothing. I decided to look up documentaries and films/shows yesterday on both Bipolar and BPD (seeing as I have both) on Prime and Netflix yesterday, and whilst it was easy to find things on the Bipolar, BPD was just... a barren wasteland. Some shitty film about a chick who comes off her meds and starts her own talk show, and *Girl, Interrupted*. Needless to say, I was pretty bummed out. Books where a character has BPD - openly, with the diagnosis out there and present - are also incredibly hard to find. I get it, there's some sort of stigma and people likely find it hard to present our condition in a way that anyone and everyone can sympathise/empathise with, but it's genuinely starting to make me just want to do something about it. Just get out there and write something. So, fuck it. That's what I'm going to do. **Here's where I need your help:** I want to get it right. I want to write something that both people who have BPD and people who need to learn about BPD can connect with - I want it to be honest. I want it to be real. I want it to represent us, as many of us as possible, and the things we deal with, have dealt with, will potentially deal with in the future. The good, the bad, the stuff that we hate is true about us and the stuff we wish people knew. I want your voices. Your experiences, symptoms, what you want the world to see of you and what you don't want the world to see. I want to know what situations you'd like seen represented in a movie, a book. I have my own experiences, my own symptoms, by own desires as to what I'd like to see represented but I'm just one fuckin' person - it matters to me that I get a little of everything, in as much as it's possible. I've never been to a support group. I've never had someone outright insult me for my condition. I've never met anyone else with BPD in real life. There are many things I've experienced, but many things I haven't. If you'd be willing to share some of your experiences, good and bad, I'd be so grateful to you - and I know it's hard. I know opening up makes vulnerability reign supreme. I know what I'm asking, and I know it's bold, but I just so deeply, sincerely want to reach however many people I can and educate in a way that is both enjoyable and real. Tangible. If you'd be willing to help me - and your name etc isn't important unless you want to share it, I'm not looking to include that sort of thing unless you'd like a mention - please reach out. If you want to be heard, please reach out. PM me, tell me what you want from what I write and tell me what you want the world to see. Or just PM and ask me questions; that's cool, too. You can talk to me and then decide if you want to share. I want to get to work on this. Ardently. Give me a chance, if you're willing. I'm Lys, 31 years old and diagnosed for six years. And I really want some fucking decent representation."

It was a favorite person.,15,gzz2g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/gzz2g1/im_realizing_i_didnt_have_a_crush_it_was_a/,2020-06-10 09:31:46,Hello. Im slowly realizing I might have BPD. No I have not gotten diagnosed and not asking to be diagnosed but yes eventually I will ask for professional help. I also have OCD. Its that I read the term favorite person yesterday and looked it up and if that doesnt EXACTLY sum up my relationship with a crush. Im a girl and Ive struggled with my sexual identity. I thought Im bi and that was why I couldnt live without that girl. But everything I read about favorite person checks the god damn box for how I treated her.. she came in my life at a time of EXTREME vulnerability and pain with love and affection and I held on to her like she was a god damn lifeguard. She gave me SO much attention and made me special and I thought she liked me and I liked her back in return until when I did tell her she told me that she did not like me. I realized its because I dont have experience with love and that I was so broken at the time I met her that I just held on to her and confused that with love/crush. I ultimately cut her out from my life after she stopped treating me special because I couldnt fucking handle it. I was jealous and heartbroken and every single bad emotion in the world. We havent spoken in months but it eats me up every day and I dream about her. When I saw favorite person and symptoms for BPD I seriously hit my head like 3 times in a row because fuck. Thats me. And I feel horrible for myself. I feel like a fucking walking open wound begging for attention and love. Fuck. Edit 1: any comments/advice is fine.
15,vulnerability,BPD,I cant do this anymore,1,hdxyqi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/hdxyqi/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,2020-06-23 04:35:39,"Im really struggling. I feel that nobody cares about me. Ive felt this way since I was a young teen. I am battling severe depression and emotional torment because my only good friend Ive made in this new city hasnt spoken to me in a month. She said she needed some space to better process everything and is not cutting me off after I opened up to her about some things (I was essentially laying everything out on the table and expressing all my fears and being very vulnerable) she already knows a lot about that. I know when shes going through things she needs time for herself but a week after I sent that she still said distance is the healthiest thing, would like for that to be understood and respected and said things like she feels God is doing amazing things in my life and what she can do best is distance herself at this time to which I began to freak out and ask her does this have more to do with me or her, that I need more reassurance. That Im here to meet her needs but I need to be given more reassurance bc it feels shes abandoning me and I literally opened up more about that the time we hung out before this and after. Its been a month already and she has not gotten back to me. Yet she is posting on social media. I am friends with her sister and last time we talked she said that shes not been talking to anyone. Okay, that doesnt justify anything. She has issues with vulnerability and intimacy ever since her ex and Im the first person shes gotten close to, so I know thats a big factor why but she has said things in the past how she never wants to do anything to hurt me yes this is the worst thing that she could possibly do. Im trying to trust her but shes said in the past that when she needs time for herself she has a bad habit of ghosting people and never getting back. I would never expect shed do that to me. One month of time apart is not necessary. I know I did not do or say anything wrong but thats what I keep thinking. I have been so depressed over this because I cannot have one more friend abandon me. It feels like she doesnt even care about me. I have been miserable and Im hurting so badly and I feel she doesnt give a crap. I am the most understanding and patient person in the world but I need to be given the same amount of respect and understanding. There are more details to this but thats the basic gist. I really feel this friendship is from God and that its not over but it feels like shes abandoning me Im so hurt Im so tired of opening up and trusting people and caring about others I dont see the point of life anymore I want to just express on social media that I need help but you all know how that is I put a stupid acronym of how Im feeling in hopes that at least one person will be able to decode it. (IWTGUOE - I want to give up on everything) and so forth I know that its not this mental illness that has affected our friendship. Because she many times has been overwhelming and emotional to me too, we are both emotional but Im just feeling that Im too much, that nobody cared about me, thinking shes thinking horrible things.

Again I know I may be overthinking and shell probably get back to me but people are unpredictable and that doesnt change the fact that basically neglecting and ignoring a supposed best friend is wrong"
16,vulnerability,BPD,A written work/poem about dissociative state and suicidal ideation by me :),1,gdw8gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/gdw8gp/a_written_workpoem_about_dissociative_state_and/,2020-05-05 21:44:19,"Hello people, I love writing, and posted them on some sites and lately my therapist suggested that I turned my thoughts into a written work or a poem to get it all out of my mind. And I find it helpful since I ended up doing this instead of harming myself. I'd like to share this with this because I think the frustration over BPD symptoms despite knowing that they're symptoms and not yourself, is quite relatable to people with BPD, especially the quiet type. **Trigger warning though for the subject topic**. . . . . . **Disappear** I want to disappear. When self loathings override self soothings, at times like this I devolve into a spineless doll. One whose strings rustic old, joints squeaking despite the grease, less dignified-no, least dignified, and prone to stellar falls. Still hung upright, but neck lowered and feet sunken to the floor, gazing emptily with limbs unfelt in the haze of nebulous thought. Taken aback, be taken back, for I have not been coming back. And I'm horrified. Enthralled of course, but horrified. I am no doll, you see? I am but a humble blobs of fleshy tissues in a body of a *slightly* more intelligent primate  I was dignified, upright because I was standing proud of my mounting, worldly, spiritual relish. Or the equivalent of that, I'm no longer certain of many things now. What I'm certain of is the magnitude of symptoms. My inclination to notice flaws; to brood upon them, on what can be improved is my natural state, yet now it has ridiculously overgrown. I noticed flaws with no zeal to fix them. Friendly teasings sound like a treacherous stab in the back. Polite gestures are perceived as a threat. Loving touches are thought as illicit attempt to take advantage of my vulnerability. Despite how strong my self-principles are, opinions of strangers suddenly hold more weight. Academic lust; whom I loved to have and pursue, no longer bear significance to myself. Businesses got mixed with personals. Objectively helpful suggestions sound like dictatorial tyrannies. I am a ticking-time explosive with unusually long burning wick that eventually does not explode, I implode. My muscles are tense, I'm at my wit's end, **I am no longer rational and I despise this.** And I try. Goddamn it, I fucking try. Have warm showers, eat your food, regulate your breathing, Talk about it, take your meds, exercise-no skipping! Be kinder to self, keep a structure, distract yourself from fading. How the hell am I supposed to do the latter? *I make no sense. I make no fucking sense. How come this makes no sense.* I do not want to fade I do not want to fade I only want to disappear I need to disappear. But I can't. Because I want to be here."

I hate it and feel completely powerless over it. Its my amygdala (fight flight or freeze part of the brain) is CHRONICALLY inflamed lol. Like I assess every second of my life as is this safe? How many of you can relate to this extreme anger like I am talking startling so easy maybe just hitting your elbow on the corner of the wall sets you off type rage. Has ANY medication helped? I am an older Borderline. And 20 years ago I briefly took Mellaril and it worked wonders. I have yet to have found anything to help. SSRIs help numb out all my OTHER emotions like sadness and vulnerability which is what I WANT to feel to heal past traumas or whatever. But they never curb the edge off my anger.

We met at work back in February and have become pretty close friends and Id like to think hes being genuine with me but his behavior raises a lot of red flags. I have BPD and I find that others who struggle with personality disorders are immediately attracted to me and relationships can develop very quickly between them and myself. Im the only one who likes him at our place of employment besides his best friend who even himself admits that our mutual friend can be manipulative, deceptive and selfish. He actively tries to provoke people, has no respect for rules and authority and always tries to involve others in his business schemes. The fact that our friendship is potentially just another manipulation scheme is worrisome for me since I tend to put a lot of stock in my relationships. If hes being genuine with me, it would seem that he has BPD traits as well. He gets defensive when confronted and will lash out and cut someone out of his life, and the friends he does have he seems to bond with more closely than Id expect a true ASPD to. He can be genuinely helpful like when he helped me pass my drug test for a very important job opportunity and he motivates me to seize opportunities instead of allowing life to pass me by. He appears to have the capacity for empathy but only for those who are in his good graces. He never shows vulnerability and the only emotion Ive ever seen him display is anger, but he admitted to crying when a celebrity hes a fan of died, which I cant see a true ASPD doing. And while hes not emotionally vulnerable hes open to sharing his experiences and is open to listening to mine and I hope its genuine interest and not just a way to gather information that can be used to manipulate me in the future. To complicate matters, he identifies as straight but shows a lot of signs that would lead me to think otherwise. He has a girlfriend and Im several occasions has attempted to hook up with me when were both drunk. Hes hyper masculine but his friends and even his own brother suspect that he might be gay or bi so Im thinking maybe thats where some of the aggressive behaviors stem from. Based on your experiences, does he sound like he possesses ASPD traits, BPD traits or both? Id like to think both, that while hes a notorious schemer, manipulator and clout chaser, that his emotions are authentic and that his friendship with me is valuable and not just some way to get what he wants, i.e. money, sex. Ive met BPD males and have been involved with many both romantically and platonically and while they display some aggressiveness and can be manipulated prone to violence, theyre a lot more emotional and less pragmatic than my friend is. Any take on this situation is helpful."

I have a severely mentally ill mother, her, and my dad don't have the best of relationship. The small rural community I am in is also not the best of environments, my buddy describe it as north highlands to someone who wasn't familiar with the area, and north highlands isn't the best area. So that all took a tole on me growing up, I was always in trouble for fighting it didn't matter who it was I was always fighting, and that included adult's. Just imagine the most violent first grader. I actually ended up stabbing someone at a yung age because of how violent I was. I got better as I grew up, I moved out, and away when I grew up. I started having issues again because I couldn't handle coming to the realization the kind of life I had been living. I started comparing myself to the people around me, and I ended up trying to take my life. One failed suicide attempt later, and me destroying my social life it left me in the perfect position for my mom to use my vulnerability to manipulate me into moving back in with her, and my dad. That lasted all of a week. They kicked me out, I had no place to go, and I was lucky that a friend's family would take me inn. My mom quickly started to manipulate me again, she would try to convince me that the family had no idea why I was there. That I just refused to get out of there lives, and of course I asked them. They said it was cool I was there, but my mom did end up getting into my head the offer of money to help me get on my feet was too much to resist, and I fell right back into hell. My parent's cornered me, I started to panic, I grabbed a knife I told them to stay away from me. I threw the knife down, and ran out the door. I didn't have gas in my car, and there was nowhere to run so in my panic I pushed my car down a hill to get more attention on what was happening. I ended up in the hospital very shortly after that, and then they released me back into my parents custody. I don't remember exactly what happened when I was in the hospital they had me pretty doped up, they had to ise the thorazine shot on me a couple of time's, and I don't think I made the manipulation/abuse clear. My parents then tried to convince me that I am Bipolar, they even had my childhood doctor trying to convince me. I went back into my fighting mode to protect myself, and so I argued about everything they tried to convince me of. They ended up threatening me that I will be homeless again if I don't agree with there dignosis, and so I ended up allowing myself to be manipulated again. I did end up going out, and getting my own dignosis, and it turns out I have BPD/PTSD. I got three opinions, just to make absolutely sure I wasn't being lied too or manipulated. Well as you can imagine thing's where not going to well for me, being in a rural town with no money, and no job opportunities didn't give me much to work with. I ended up getting kicked out again, after quite a bit of physical abuse. I ended up getting choked out, beat up, chased over a 5 mile's through the woods at night, and constantly being verbally abused. I was kicked out because I couldn't pay rent, I couldn't get rent money because I didn't have gas, I couldn't go to my Job a friend got me because of it. They litterly where a manager at a store over a hour away, and I was just trying to meet my parents demands with that Job so I wouldn't have issues. Well the day they kicked me out, they all decided to beat the shit out of me, I was rolling around on the floor fighting my dad, my mom, and brother where kicking me when I was on the ground. They called the cop's, they said I was a danger to myself, and other's. They got me put on a 5150 hold so I couldn't get them in trouble, the sheriff that arrested me had been out to the house quite a few time's by that point, and so he didn't believe them. But he also had to keep me on a 5150 hold because of what they said. I don't know if I could have pressed charges or what, and I was a little stressed out seeing as I was homeless yet again. I had been loading my car up preparing for that to happen again, and so I had a nice time camping out in the cold forest. They baught a trailer to keep up appearance, and to make sure they still had control of my life. So I have been stuck in isolation, in a rural town, with no Job opportunities, and according to my counselor I exhausted all of my option's today. I have applied for every type of disability which most likely I won't qualify for because of how much treatment I have received since my dignosis. (If you don't know most people with BPD don't have symptoms after the first year of treatment, and almost everyone doesn't meet the criteria for diagnosis after the second year.) So disability is filed for again, and I'm waiting to have to go through that rejection all over again. That leaves unemployment, and I'll be applying for that. If that doesn't work out there's nothing I can do. I'm just stuck in isolation, with no income, no hope of getting a job, and not even a car because of a accident I got into. I'm just waiting for a miracle at this point, my counselor even said that I am waiting on a miracle to happen. It's just depressing that 2 people stole my entire life from me, and I just have to accept that this is my lot in life. What more can I do?"

On Sunday evening, he told me he really likes me in a moment of vulnerability. And I'm supposed to be happy about it, but I'm scared. It can't be real. We keep on texting, we have plans to see each other on Friday (or during the week-end), but I'm about to cancel everything and hide. I'm afraid of getting hurt again and again. I just want support at this point. My mental state even on meds isn't working right now. With everything happening, it's hard.

Anyways, I rarely ever get emotionally attached to people -- because if I do, the moment they show too much interest back, my feelings come to a strict halt. I prefer the push/pull chase of going after people who are only lukewarm about me, so I can ""win"" them over and get validation from making someone invested in me. I met someone on Tinder during the beginning of quarantine, and he was an emotionally intelligent person who asked a lot of inquisitive questions, therefore I was vulnerable with him and opened up a lot and told him a lot of personal things. I started idealizing him and imagining what a potential relationship with him would be like, despite never actually having met him. But every time I'd tell him something extra personal, I'd unfriend him or block him for an hour or two because I'd panic and think I told him too much, and then afterwards would come back and apologize. I always felt SO embarrassed after the fact, but in the moment it felt like I had to cut contact or else. He seemed understanding about it in the beginning, but each time it happened I could see it start to grate on him more and more. We finally met in person last week and even though I thought it went well, his texting behaviors dropped dramatically (we used to text all day, but after meeting he'd take hours to respond), making my feelings of abandonment skyrocket. I convinced myself I was just a back burner option -- which I honestly probably was, since I know he was dating other girls -- and I ended up getting really clingy and would text him daily for reassurance. We had plans to hangout tonight, but yesterday I ended up doing the whole ""cut contact"" thing AGAIN after seeing he was online all day but left my message from the night before on read. I unblocked him a little while later and tried to apologize and asked if he still wanted to hangout, but he viewed it and never replied. I'm sure he thinks I'm absolutely batshit insane. I feel so stupid, because maybe I *wasn't* actually a back burner option and I pushed away what could've been a potentially good thing if I just gave him some breathing room. How can I stop idealizing or putting people on a pedestal, and even more so, how can I STOP this block/unfriend thing when I show the slightest hint of vulnerability? This doesn't happen often because I rarely do catch feelings, but when it does I always find some way to screw it up."

About a year ago I found myself in a very bad place. My ex of many years had left , and a parent had died. Feeling overwhelmed and alone, I reached out online for support. It was here I became acquainted with someone who, under the guise of being my ""friend"" proceeded to use and take advantage of me. For the next year this person would come and go, but not before collecting things like free vacations, gas money, cigarettes, gifts, meals, toys and even basic necessities for their child (of course because they did not work). Then when the well dried up they would pick a fight and disappear, only to return when they were broke and/or burned all bridges again. It was an online, long distance thing and during our periods of ""friendship"" we would video chat, text and talk everyday. We even vacationed together during the summer (all, of course at my expense). Yet, like clockwork when something or someone better came along they would again disappear. This happened a total of 4 times in one year. And yes, it was my fault for allowing it to happen, but they found me on a forum, much like this, and preyed on my loneliness and vulnerability. This is not speculation on my part, it was something actually said to me recently before being ghosted again (presumably for the last time). They told me they never cared, nor even liked me as a person, and needed to go no contact again. This was someone I considered my best friend and FP, so as you might imagine hearing this was devastating. This happened right before the quarantine, and I have not heard a peep since. It has now been three weeks. I was dumped and blocked everywhere the same day they received a large government check, and it will stay that way until --you guessed it--- they either are broke or have burned all bridges again. In other words, until I have a use. I wanted to share my story so what happened to me, does not happen to you. I have met many wonderful people online, but unfortunately predators do exist and we need to be careful. Particularly I have noticed a tendency for them to target the BPD community, feeling we are extra vulnerable. Sometimes they even pretend to have BPD, as my ""bestie"" did so they can better connect and take advantage of us so please, please be careful."

Im 28 years old and everything I have been through in my life I consider to have been a traumatic experience. Theyve all been super negative and no matter how much Ive pushed through it all, it just further breaks me down. It gives me ptsd, trauma, fears, anxieties, and its gotten to the point right now where sometimes i just wanna scream and curl up in a ball like Angelina Jolie at the end of the movie Girl, Interrupted. Everybody in my life has either abandoned me or betrayed me. The warmth and unconditional love that has ever been given to me has always been swiped away by something horrible someone has done to me. A lot of times I feel cold and empty. Just an unending loneliness. My last gf was my best friend for two years. Then we had sex and fell in love and...turns out she was either bpd herself or was a narcissist. I never did find out. She emotionally abused me and then discarded me. Not sure if it was intentional or not. But our situation was...extremely complicated. She was muslim and she had to decide between me and her family. It was the most intense, neurotic, insane, toxic, but amazing relationship Ive ever had in my life. I could be myself with her. She accepted everything about me. I could just talk and talk for hours about everything and shes listen. She would give me love for hours and hours and never wanna stop. It was...everything Ive ever wanted. But now shes gone. The breaking up phase took about 6 months in itself...the experience was yet another traumatic event in my life. Now Im SCARED of vulnerability. And worse yet I have nobody else. Just me. And unending loneliness. Ive been in the military...more trauma. I can barely hold a job because I just wanna break down quickly if anybody has anything even slightly negative to say about me. I feel like my skin is getting THINNER the older I get. I feel myself getting angrier, all the time. I used to have my own place but I couldnt afford it anymore because I couldnt work anymore because of my breakdowns. Now Im back home with an alcoholic mother who harasses me every day. Im not suicidal, never have been. But my desire for SOME KIND OF CONNECTION is making me go insane. I cant get a date anymore because Im too desperate. Heck I even lie to people to get them to wanna be around me more. I crave that connection and warmth so much that its tearing me apart. Ive tried stoicism, but the problem is still the fact that i crave that connection so much it makes me wanna scream. It makes me wanna hate the world. I still have sex sometimes with some FWB girls that Ive known, but thats not what Im talking about. Im talking about LOVE. Quality time. Bonding. Vulnerability. Being able to be my whole complete self and have you tell me I love that about you. Just thinking about it makes me cry. Im crying right now actually. The fact that my ex gave me all of this makes me miss her even that much more. I dont...really even have an identity. I dont think so at least. Im not sure. I know my interests, I know the music that defines me, I THINK I know my personality...but Im not sure. Am I overthinking this? Or under thinking it? I dont even really know who I am. I TELL myself that I am...whoever I WANT to be. I find myself becoming someone else or pulling life advice out of my ass, just because...Im trying something new. Im being someone else today. Some people out there think Im an empath...some think Im an asshole and a narcissist. I try out new things. See what works and what doesnt. Ive lied so much I dont even know myself anymore. Because if I told the truth...nobody would like me. Ive become so insecure in nearly every aspect of life just out of pure FEAR of being hurt...that its made me avoidant. Ive become people pleasing. A doormat. Because I just want that closeness. I want to share smiles. All I feel is a giant gaping hole. All the time. Sorry for the rant guys. Just trying this out. Maybe something here will help me. And yes I have a therapist and shes great, but she cant be there for me all the time."

I have recently remembered the warmth that my auntie, Kimberly, provided for me while my biological parents were away at work. She was my mother role. Even more recently, have I been able to make the connection between her sudden departure with my intense fear of abandonment. My parents weren't so great at explaining things. In fact, I had no real semblance of their schedule, not really ever being able to depend on whether or not Mum or Dad would be home. But Kimberly was. And to my misfortune, no-one had the courage to speak softly to a scared little 7 year old boy to tell him that Kimberly would not be visiting anymore due to a family disagreement. It was as if all the hot water in the house was turned off, and I didn't notice. About a full 20 years later, I am just coming around to looking at this with vulnerability in my right hand and forgiveness in the left. But I'm having such a hard time believing that I'm being too hard on myself. It is terribly easy to blame myself for all of the damage that it's caused to me, and for all the damage that I have left in my destructive trail so far. That whole, being biologically susceptible to developing BDP mixed with an invalidating environment is right on the money. It's where I have taken these rulesets and designed them into my biosocial wiring. Emotional dysfunction, cognitive dysfunction, inter-personal dysfunction. The gang is all here. It's just us now.

I know he can't help disengaging, but it really frustrates me because it feels so disrespectful when he still falls asleep when I'm talking. He'll also stop listening when I'm talking and I'll get frustrated when he doesn't remember something I told him while we were looking dead at each other. In that same vein, last year I lost a friend to suicide, which I shared with him in a rare moment of vulnerability. We've had the discussion that I don't appreciate jokes or comments about drug abuse or suicide more than once, and he can't remember not to joke or make a comment on it in a self deprecating way until I'm already hurt. Quarentine has us back in our childhood homes, so we're currently attempting long distance and I don' t know if he'll be able to maintain a relationship when he can't physically be with me. I wouldn't normally try so hard for a relationship that's barely gotten it's legs, but we got serious pretty quickly (haha definitely not a BPD thing right eyy). Does anyone have any tips on managing those outbursts of anger and frustratoin? We get on really well, and I think things could be good if I find how we can mesh his diagnosis and mine."

While I haven't been diagnosed BPD, my therapists have noticed I have a tendancy to split. I have CPTSD and dissociate quite a bit, which contributes to the vulnerability of my moods. I tend to be either high or low. As you know, it is super sucky because you never really know how you'll wake up and what kind of day you'll end up having as a result of it. I usually categorize my day as ""bad"" or ""good,"" which is only exacerbated in the evenings when I have to hurry and make sure I can at least categorize it as ""other: productive."" After a ton of therapy and important feedback from my partner, I have learned where my moods are negatively impacting those around me. My moods have caused me and others significant mental, emotional, and physical pain, even going so far as to cause my partner to develop PTSD of her own with physical violence as a way to protect herself against me in her own home. I want so much to break the cycle, which I have not successfully done up to this point. But I want to be better and curb the rage that comes out of low moods. How have you successfully pulled yourselves out of a low mood, especially given the extreme feelings associated with BPD? Thank you so much in advance."

For the sake of being honest (and vulnerable): After lots of hurt, pain, lost relationships, awareness, therapy, forgiveness, and continued healing into the future, I made a choice to give someone with whom I'd had a toxic relationship another chance. I'd fallen in love with said person while still in a long-distance (and unfairly balanced) relationship, which led to a lot of deep wounds, sweat and tears for both of our (now) exes. This attachment was actually the tipping point to accepting that I was exhibiting strong borderline symptoms and needed to get help quickly before I unraveled my entire life. He has since gone through his own psychological health journey and has committed to change. In the time we've agreed to heal and move on from the past, I've kept our relationship quiet. Friends who either didn't know the full extent of the drama - and those who did and stuck it out with me and were supportive of my road from pain/shame/self-loathing - noticed that I've seemed calmer, happier, and more content... but during this time I have been carefully editing my life on social media (and in person) to leave him out of a lot of my social narrative. It's been four months. Quarantine has REALLY tested us/me, but where he's been at fault, so have I, and we change and grow accordingly. Recently, my partner overheard during a Zoom call with friends back home that I completely excluded talk of us staying together during quarantine, and he asked if I was still ashamed of us/embarrassed about our past. I think I very much tie my choice to re-try this to the belief that I'm broken, incompetent, and can't make good choices. I recently tried starting slow by putting more stuff about us out there and finding myself SO anxious about judgement. I see SO much Twitter conversation about cutting toxic people out of your life, but never anything providing hope and understanding to toxic situations/people that are changing to be better. Friends and acquaintances have praised how proud of me they are ""for making the right choices"" and it only helps strengthen my fear to say anything. I want to feel proud of my journey and the effort to get there but find myself hiding, and then feeling VERY isolated because I can't genuinely connect the way I need to. How does you guys handle the distress of being vulnerable, especially when social media/virtual connection is kinda all we have? Sorry this is so long."
31,vulnerability,BPD,I have so much anger and its exhausting and making me hate my girlfriend,1,g7snn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/g7snn1/i_have_so_much_anger_and_its_exhausting_and/,2020-04-25 22:23:21,"Ive voiced to the people around me that my level of anger has been concerning. Ive always been an angry person, jumping from happy to angry in a heartbeat. I dont know why. I always assumed it was just something I got from my dad. But sometimes I swear it seems not even he was this angry at everything. I just sit and let it consume me. There have been times where I felt like I was going to give myself a panic attack with how angry I was. I just had to move. I just had to punch something, or throw my phone, or yell. Even now Im a little mad. I woke up that way. If Im not feeling sad or empty, Im angry. If Im in a good mood, its short lived. All it takes is one thought, and I cant shake it. I cant just turn it off. For the past year Id say a lot of my anger has been aimed at my girlfriend. And she doesnt even really know. I keep it in. Theres so much shit I keep in. Thats what Ive always done. I havent been diagnosed with BPD, but lately Ive been doing a bit of research because something about my response to things doesnt seem normal? It makes me feel like a child sometimes. Or like Im socially incompetent. This then leads me to believe Im incompetent in every area of my life and should just die, but I digress. BPD is characterized by how we go about interpersonal relationships, right? Im just now realizing somethings off because this is the only relationship Ive had that lasted more than 2 months. Even looking back though I realize some of my reactions with gfs and friends werent right. All this anger doesnt seem normal. Ive thought that for such a long time and while I dont like the idea of self-diagnosis, I kinda feel better knowing that maybe just maybe Ive put my finger on it? If Im not fully Borderline, I definitely have a few quiet BPD tendencies. So, Im pretty sure I love my girlfriend. Whenever Im in a decent headspace, I want the best for her. Hell, even sometimes when Im in a bad headspace I have her in mind. Certain gestures lead me to believe that there is genuine love there... somewhere. But, I get so fucking mad at her over the slightest thing. When we first started dating I blew things that she said out of proportion. Made up situations/assumptions inside my head, like she doesnt really love me, shes going to cheat on me with that guy she used to fuck or when she doesnt answer, shes probably fucking him right now, or I would totally interpret something she said in a ridiculous way and take offense to it. Wed start a conversation fine. Shed say one thing that I dont like or take offense to and I just shut down. I either start talking very monotone and cant seem to make myself interested in a word she has to say or become passive aggressive and cold but disguise it as sarcasm. Which she picks up on. Ill say Im good, but whenever she falls asleep Im sometimes just overcome with rage. The other night I was pissed at her because... I honestly cant remember why but I think part of it was just her being annoying and I felt like she was putting all her shit on me when I also have shit going on and literally cannot make myself give enough of a shit. I struggle with empathy when Im in a bad place. Its scary. Anyway she didnt respond to me being distant and shut off so I became even more distant. I expected her to ask if I was alright, even though every day when she asked how I was doing Id say Im doing well. I expected her to pick up on my energy through text. But she didnt. Now I realize thats kinda ridiculous but also, not really? I feel like she doesnt even know me or when Im truly upset. One night this week I was up thinking about her and I just got so pissed. I started calling her all these names and saying I wish shed disappear if I didnt already have a hole in my wall that Ive heard enough about, I wouldve smashed my fist in it. The next morning I felt physically sick and ashamed for the things I said, even though they werent to her face. I go through these cycles of loving her to being completely disinterested in/disliking her. I feel so indifferent to her. Before all this quarantine bs she could be right beside me and Id want to get the hell away from her. Its like, shes nothing to me. Then suddenly once things clear up I cant wait to see her, Im more affectionate and open. This past week Ive felt like I dont want to talk to her really. Ive felt so indifferent, and when she says I love you or I miss you, it drains me to say it back because Im not one for saying something I dont mean like that, but yesterday after I told her vaguely Ive been going through some shit, I felt slightly better. She reassured me that she loved me. And for the first time in a week, I missed her. Then like an hour later I was somewhat mad again and not even interested in her existence. Its... exhausting. She doesnt even know I feel this way on and off. I hold all of it in and I feel like I could just explode. Ive never really said a mean word to her. Ive only been extremely sarcastic and insensitive about things. Never called her a name to her face. I dont think Ive ever even yelled at her. I know this is long but maybe since were all at home bored some of you actually read it. I just feel really confused and alone and because Im so afraid of vulnerability and being emotional in front of others, I have a hard time talking about emotions with my girlfriend. I want to explain to her my feelings. But at the same time I dont want her to think Im crazy. I think I owe it to her though. Im so engaged and invested one second then sometimes for days I become distant and cant have a pleasant conversation with her for the life of me because of some small thing she did/said. Its causing her distress. I already broke up with her once because I thought Id lost feelings for her and when I get like that she thinks its going to happen again and it really freaks her out. I just feel like I cant be a stable boyfriend? I see these couples out and I feel jealous of them because they seem happy and of course I assume theyre happy all the time and so in love and not constantly going back and forth between love and hate. I dont know how to stop my overwhelming feelings. This emptiness. This indifference. This weird love/hate thing Ive had going on. I feel so empty and think about the end pretty much any time that Im sober. Sometimes even when Im not sober. Ive used drugs, any I can easily get my hands on, almost every day for the past year. I can safely say I havent gone a full week without being high or drunk in over a year. Im so impulsive that I do things that I know are fucked up/not good for me. I almost cheated on my girlfriend because she called this guy cute. Sometimes I feel so mad that I just have to use because if I dont Ill be fixated on anything and everything that could possibly fuel my anger. And Ill sulk and shut down and take out my anger on my family. Obviously I dont want to do that. Ive known I need therapy now for so long but its hard to commit to things like that. I started to make an appointment yesterday but stopped myself and told myself I wasnt even worth it. I want to tell my girlfriend all of this but I just think shell think Im full of shit because every now and then I break down and tell her about my problems but I never do anything about it. I feel sad because Im scared that eventually, as much as she loves, itll run out and shell leave me. I actually keep having dreams that she breaks up with me or cheats on me. I had one this morning and felt like crying as soon as I woke up. It also made me kinda mad at her. Yeah, I know it was a dream but if I keep acting this way and being an asshole, really it would be no ones fault but my own if she broke up with me and partially my fault if she cheated. Neglect and all..."
32,vulnerability,BPD,I can't comprehend having intimate relationships without equating it to romance,1,gca8q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/gca8q3/i_cant_comprehend_having_intimate_relationships/,2020-05-03 03:26:04,"IDK if this is a bpd symptom but I really have trouble understanding that I (or anyone) can have friendships as intimate as romantic/family relationships. This has led to a lot of insecurity from me when my SO makes new friends and becomes very close with them. I get jealous because my brain thinks it's romantic bc they're so close when yknow it's entirely possible to have friendships without any hint of romance at all. On a superficial/theoretical level I do understand that it's possible, but deep down it feels like my brain is just hardwired into thinking the complete opposite. On the other hand I feel like this might also stem from me not actually having any intimate relationships aside from my SO. When I sense any kind of intimacy or vulnerability from me or a friend, I instinctively back away, because I don't want it to turn into a romantic thing (even when I was single I was already like this, lol). It sucks bc as much as it hurts to admit, I do just want to have the same level of intimacy my SO has with his best friends as I do with my own best friends. But I'm scared, and I don't know where to start fixing this. I actually tried to be better the past few months with being more vulnerable with friends but they don't seem to reciprocate it, which hurts. I just end up hiding in my shell again like a damn scared turtle."
33,vulnerability,BPD,"When you have it so good, that you know it just has to go bad",1,flozti,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/flozti/when_you_have_it_so_good_that_you_know_it_just/,2020-03-20 15:49:21,"In the past I've had quite the roster of toxic partners, myself in the midst of some aswell. Since I can remember dating, it's always left such a sour taste in my mouth. I was diagnosed with depression, (dysthymia) when I was 13, and have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder when I was 18. I tend to invest heavily into those I care about, and split from those who care ""enough"" or too much, to the point where the vulnerability shown to me can be quite unappealing one day, or absolutely wonderful the next.. Something interesting has happened that I can't help but share though.. I've been in a relationship for half a year, with a man who, quite literally, treats me like a queen. In my mind I fell in love with him before this all came about, as we were both working together, for upwards of 12-14 hours a day for a year prior. We became such close best friends, and leading up to our relationship, it was something out of a movie. I think it was maybe a few months after we started dating that I noticed myself losing that ""spark"" with him. It was almost like a shift in time, I was so in love to the next day being so turned off from his attention and affection that I wanted nothing to do with it anymore. It got so bad that I had to leave the relationship for a couple months.. Now being a borderline, this never happens for me. I have idolized and centered my world and desicions in life around so many of these past men., But for the wrong reasons. This behaviour sticks out in 3 nasty relationships I've been through. I noticed a pattern, when I have a man in my life degrading me, making me feel sub-par, not good enough, like a nuisance etc, I almost feel like I fall more and more in love with them. I don't know why. Every time I would be degraded, and emotionally fried. They would always come out days later and apologize, praise me, and the make up sex was always fantastic after.. now this would be the cycle of these crazy relationships I've had in the past. It was almost like being in love with the lack of stability, and believing these men are so powerful and honest to have pointed out my flaws and insecurities, and letting them win.. it was just awful looking back. Fast forward, I admitted my wrongs to this man and were back together, stronger almost. This relationship I'm in now, my man is truly a superhero in my eyes. Not only is he my best friend, but he really is the most caring person I've ever met, so sweet and kind and sensitive to my feelings, supportive of my life choices and encourages me with hobbies we share together. He's never said anything to hurt me, he's never put anything over my head, he's never done anything except *truly* cherish me. Even on my low days, (I usually get low days/moments more than I do good days/moments) he's always found a way to put up with every side of me, and love me through it. Enough goop, I'm happy. And hope it lasts. But I worry so much though, especially with all of my ""outbursts"" (moments, hours or days where my emotions will spike to a low, anger streak , or all time high) I know I hurt him. And I know I can control it better, which can bring alot of feelings of shame and despair on myself into light. Lately I've been stepping back and doing things like writing poetry, working out or doing my nails to help recognize when these shifts in moods happen, and what to do when I start to enter fight or flight mode. It's helped alot. But nothing could be more scary than knowing this is me and I may not always be in control of these things, he may very well have to deal with this for the rest of his time with me, if he can. I don't want a repeat cycle , I really hope we can stick this through, I feel so badly for taking his vulnerability for granted and I feel like I've learned a lesson from that. Anyways, rant over. I must go to bed. But I thought I'd just share one of the hardest parts of my mental health , being that it really does hurt people around you."

After he moved out, I accidentally read something about BPD and it describes him very accurately. As far as I know, he has never had any help to deal with this nor a diagnosis. Any time I asked him if he felt he needed support (relating to some serious things he told me) he emphasised that he felt completely fine. I can see now that once we started living together, I became his FP. I also really loved spending time with him, and I am really grateful for the beauty, enthusiasm, and joy he brought into my life. However later on we started to have trouble relating to each other. Any time I was less-than-perfect or showed any vulnerability, I would see his estimation of me drop and drop. Before he moved out he was not speaking to me at all and not responding to any messages I wrote. I felt nervous around him and it was really hard to talk to him. I am relieved to read these things about BPD because I always had a feeling that his behaviour was not coming from a place of malice. The thing that was confusing was that he never, ever (in all the many hours of intimate conversation we had) admitted that anything was wrong or that he wanted or needed any help, so I couldnt get any understanding of where his behaviour was coming from. Anyway, I dont now what Im looking for here exactly - Im just trying to understand and process, and wanted to share my story."

I understand this, but I don't fully understand why certain other relationships bring out the worst. While writing this I'm like duh RudeGold 4 you just answered your own question, your symptoms are worst when the communication sucks, there's no vulnerability, you don't trust each other and your needs aren't being met. I don't get it though. Even in my last shitty situationship, he reassured me at times. I can see why it wasn't enough because there was also plenty of bad stuff to focus on. Part of me is still like why wasn't that enough?? Why did I latch onto random moments or things he said that worried me when he did say ""I ONLY WANT YOU"". I'm realizing, for the second time, that staying in a bad situation and expecting myself to perform well emotionally is not healthy or realistic. But I'm still like wtf he said such nice things. I still don't understand exactly how I go from chill to BOTHERED AND THREATENED EVERY TIME HE ACKNOWLEDGES SOMEONE HE HAS SLEPT WITH BEFORE, when that is something I'd be comfortable with in a healthier relationship. I don't want to be someone who feels threatened at every mention of another woman. I'm ashamed of that jealousy. But then there's a difference between mentioning someone cos it's relevant and oversharing or doing it to arouse suspicion on purpose. I think he did a bit of both. In a way this is lesson learned. I'm worried I'll have issues with jealousy in the future but I can see now that it's usually in generally unhealthy situations that I get so insecure."

The love, the sex, the vulnerability, the value, and the devalue. Especially for someone confident and caring. Youll keep trying to fix it. Youll keep believing in love. Youll do more and more, and get less and less, until you are desperate and begging for the smallest crumb. Still waiting for her text. The chance to see her. Theres still love in her eyes. You know this. Thats all that matters. If you could just effectively dodge and communicate through the disorder and all the defense mechanism surrounding the real her, the real her locked in a box, like she told you she felt, if you could just release her, you both can make magic. Thats the hope. The real her is beautiful and loving and caring and everything youve ever wanted. But you fucked up bad. You gave her your power. A key to your soul. Shes not responsible enough. When you fight the disorder it will slam its gaze upon your reflection like a mirror. It will hate what it sees. It will resent you for it. The disorder knows your deepest wants and will use them against you to survive; it knows you want love, and affection, and sex, and deep human connection. It will take when it needs it greedily and cast aside when anything is wanted back. They will value you what you do, they will tell you they love you, that youre the only one that understand them, that you are saving them, no one is like you, they will always help and be there for you, youre sex is the best. You truly get them. They draw you in. A multiverse version of themselves. One where they didnt have the trauma, the real them. The person they would have been. Its generational trauma. You have to believe this. The alternative is the real them is just bait for a survival disorder ready to feed. You want these things, you seek them, and when you do they push you away. The will devalue anything you have ever done. In fact, its now a burden to them, and they wish you never helped them at all. THE PUSH/PULL manipulation. Value. Devalue. Its beyond fucked. Its hurtful. Youre begging for someone to make you feel better who will never make you feel better. Its sad. BUT ITS an ILLUSION. She holds no real power over you. Take your power back. Be your best self. You fucked up and tried to have love and help someone. Not the biggest fuck up. You still can have love. She is suffering. Theres something in there you love and thats real, but there is an disorder. It turns her off that you even want to be good to her. She feels so low compared to you. She wonders what must be wrong with you to even bother with her. She is in pain. She feels worthless. And youve been there. You know what its like to suffer, youve been through things, and youve overcome. You can have compassion for her. But also compassion for yourself. She doesnt get to have you in her life anymore. She fucked up. She is only the source of your suffering if you allow her to be. Youve allowed enough. Remember who you are. Theres is inward focus and learning and you will apply them going forward. You want so badly to leave things, on good terms and have closure, but no. Thats not reality. A part of you still wants validation from her because something inside you feels like you may never find a real love. Thats not true. Better yourself and be ready for the next opportunity. Your power is in leaving and not looking back."

Upon reading, massive squeamishness. Innocuous things like greeting cards (ones with the small cursive or print), texts, emails (when people still did that) trigger me for some reason. Its probably not a BPD thing, and rather a my being a dick thing. Its like if I know its come from a place of vulnerability/asks for vulnerability, I subconsciously nope that shet hard. It feels draining being the recipient even as Im rationally aware the contents are positive. Dont get me wrong. I can be super affectionate at times (newer trait). When I do respond, its often mush for mush. I sometimes initiate the mush. (A sad aside; I have actually physically mushed before.) I love and appreciate these senders. But I do avoid certain messages the way one may avoid certain types of mail. And people. So is this a thing..? Is this some sort of aversion towards being validated? Of being exposed to anothers vulnerability. Or just avoidance of the overly saccharine, Hollywood type gesturing/posturing. Oh and they hardcore make me cry. May edit. Too much sleepiness at 4am~"

Im fine with being causal friends - but you did inspire me to look a little deeper into myself, and I am always grateful for being inspired :) In hindsight, I trail back to a conversation we had at the casino; I had said that sometimes I dont feel like people ever truly get to know me; that I feel like that line from ES; ""Im just a fucked up girl - whose trying to find her own piece of mind"" - that people liked the idea of me, to them I was a concept - something that could complete them, or save something within themselves...and I replay it; trying to remember what your reaction had been, if you looked down, away; or touched your face...I cant remember. I wish I had paid more attention. Then later; as if in a self fulfilling prophecy: After, in typical BPD fashion, I had bluntly questioned the validity; or even the existence of your feelings in relation to your actions; when you failed to fill my irrational need for attention. I ungracefully fell from my own self-sabotage. In actuality I was being triggered by a very real fear of abandonment before it was even happening. In retrospect, I am completely self aware of what I was doing, but desperate for a different ending than the one that always comes. Black and white thinking, all or nothing reaction based completely upon emotion. Then, it came: you then told me that you didnt think, ""dating was conducive to our schedules"" and gave me the grand old friend zone; stating ""I dont know you enough, to know if I like you; romantically..."" - ouch. The rest I didnt hear, or read, or even keep on my phone. Because, you see, I already knew that's what would happen. It had been designed all so specifically. So clich; was all I could think. When the real me shows up, and the cracks no longer form a pretty pattern, and the flaws are no longer quirky or endearing, when the emotions get real - you realize youll never knowme, Ill never know you either, because well both end it before it has a chance to start. Different game plan, aligned objective. Im easily led, and I put too much stock into things too quickly, let me burn it out before it has a chance to be kindred, rush the ending before it crashes down on me. Perfect protection plan. Whether it be my own self-sabotage of questioning (that I am fully aware of NOT being conducive), or your arms length turning into introverted defense mechanisms, we both lead to be lead. Im the manifestation of the cool girl, the real life manic pixiedream girl. The Clementine, the Susanna Kaysen, Tiffany trying to win the dance competition- the 500th day of Summer, ""just a fucked up girl"" But IRL, its not as ironically beautiful as it is on film. All those girls are legitimately fucked up, and they rarely ever get to tell their side. Penny Lane runs out of cool things to say, people start to feel overwhelmed or quite simply people leave, ""if you never take it seriously, you can never get hurt"" - but people get hurt anyway. If it isnt somehow tragic, melonchalicly dramatic, can it even be beautiful? The problem with the ""concept of me"" is youre only shown a one-sided, often without inner dialogue, character. The real thing; its too much, Im too intense, too needy - I am flawed if I'm not free; but yearning not to be free because I am so flawed. When the words hit, they are vivid adjectives and intense emotions that push the intended away. The sheer velocity of their honesty, its overwhelming - for so many people. Then the extreme shame for expressing that honesty afterward is often nothing short of a sort of diabolical self-loathing. Youve obviously experienced this. I unloaded those emotions on you, and then I hated myself for it. Was I a concept to you? Your lack of commentary, erring on the ""good guy"" staple answer to my emotional reaction to your ending the ""trying to get to know you better"" phase spoke volumes without saying a word. BUT I cannot place negativity on the latter statement, because - I too; boxed you up and was intrigued by what was outwardly presented to me. I stated that you ""didnt need to reply"" but instead my push/pull mentality craved emotional validation. How would you even know that; would you even care? It doesn't matter. In the earlier days of our slightly reappearing/disappearing flirtatious ways of communicating I compartmentalized my categorization of you as a ""different kind of guy"" than I usually go for; and I unknowingly idealized you because of your innate talent of creating the air of emotional vulnerability. I, in actuality, was actively participating in directly playing out my own most hated clich from the opposite side - I liked the concept of you; maybe I thought you could maybe complete me, understand me, finally someone who could potentially validate me. When in all actuality all your ability to feel so deeply and relate to such sadness and hurt and create such beautiful writings comes from somewhere deep and dark, some time in your story where youve been robbed of security, trust, and or love - and that what makes you tragic and magnetic, and albeit, what also makes you completely unavailable. Dancing the line of projection and mirroring what we want to understand in ourselves; or myself anyway - I am drawn to the familiarity -but also taken a back at what this shows me; two humans with the extreme capacity for emotion, empathy, and understanding subconsciously ending things, almost always, before they can begin. Desperate to love and be loved; but who will endlessly complicate the situation so they may revel in that familiar protected state of undamaged - AND UNFEELING emotion; or at least in this particular short chapter of us. Ultimately, making you closed off, distant, and not so easy to get to know; and myself eccentric, intense, and overly emotional. Two sides of one coin...therefore actually dooming anything before it ever even had a chance to happen. Operation defense mechanisms. Game over. But at least we will never have the chance to ruin each other; the coin toss will always go unmatched. You tragic, and me dramatic. cya around"

I've been looking around here for a few weeks trying to feel less alone in what i've been feeling and y'all seem really kind. Sorry, there's some stuff I gotta get out of my brain and it's a long one. I got diagnosed with bpd when I was 21 (25 now). Senior in college, working part time in food service, technically living with family but in reality couch surfing. It was a really unstable part of my life and I look back in surprise that I made it out alive. thought about killing myself nearly every day for years. Most my life i had few friends and the ones I did didn't last for more than a year or two most the time. But there was one friend who stuck on longer. I've known this dude since I was 14. For the semblance of privacy, I'll say that we met via being in a music group together (the drama in our circle is usually akin to band drama anyway). He was the leader, started it up, I came along and stuck around throughout all the lulls and higher points. Projects changed, people left and people came in, but at the core it was me, him, and a few others and our line up really stabilized within the last two years. I felt like I had found some real, true friendship with this group of people. With the dude at the center of it and probably the most important part of my life. I wouldn't call him an fp in the ways that i've experienced that, but he was a constant stable force that had been there for me no matter how bad I'd gotten. And things were good! He and I talked every day nearly, We'd seen each other grow a lot as people. Our friend group was great and we all really got along and became a family. My bpd symptoms weren't as bad, I hadn't thought about suicide in a year and a half, I wasn't afraid they'd leave me, I was still paranoid and kinda impulsive but I could manage it. But then things weren't so good. I got laid off from my job, I had to move back in with the aforementioned family members due to money and concerns i'd had for my physical health, I had to go back to food service for work because I couldn't mentally handle really anything else other than something i knew definitely, my mom had two very major surgeries in the space of four months and was close to dying, I had gotten really close with a girl and got feelings for her but that didn't work out. my life, which seemed hopeful for the first time, was steadily crumbling. I was really slipping down and picking fights and feeling depressed. Then the big thing happened. The dude wasn't happy with how the music group was structured anymore. He felt it wasn't going to be successful, so he wanted to scale back his involvement and change what we were doing, not have it be so stressful for him. I was for this, I gave a lot of ideas on how we could move forward and make everyone happy and have less stress on him. And he shot me down, established his iron grip on the group being 'his' since he's the one who started it and handled money and all that. I was really confused and hurt, didn't he say he wanted to scale back involvement? I didn't see how my suggestion that the other members take on more responsibility would cause him more stress and work. But that confusion and hurt quickly turned into a consuming anger and I snapped. In a group chat setting, for everyone to see, I really laid out every issue I had with this proposal and he and I's power dynamic. I didn't like how he had this control over my life and dictated my output with group, how he'd put me into other creative projects and then just give up on them if they didn't make waves within a week after he released them, how he was my boss first and friend second a lot of the time. I didn't think it was fair for us to be strung along if he wanted to stop or slow down and we didn't. This wasn't said eloquently, it was a flurry of anger and tears and betrayal over like a half hour of me stream of consciousing every gripe I had. Afterwards I left. I gave a half hearted apology a few days after to which he said I had no idea how bad I hurt him and that he didn't want to talk to me again and also you're fired. I started to really think about it all and have a bunch of meltdowns over it. I was really mean and cruel. and I did hurt him. and I shouldn't have said what I said in the way I did, but the points I made...i still stand by them. I wish i could've said them nicer and more constructively, but they're still important things that I had issues with in our relationship. Things between he and I were never perfect, I'd fight with him a lot and his lack of emotional vulnerability with me was something that really pissed me off after 11 years of friendship, but any illusion I'd ever make to that/however kind I'd try to be about it he'd say I was upsetting him and he didn't want to talk about it. So it built up and up for years until eventually I erupted to where I didn't care about his feelings anymore. and I feel so guilty and terrible about it. It's still hard to live with myself and accept what I did. He hasn't talked to me in two months. I sent an actual apology about a month ago. I check every day multiple times a day to see if he's messaged me at all. Our friends don't know how to talk to me anymore. They all saw me at what was probably my absolute worst now. Some of them knew I had bpd, but I'd never really fully elaborated on what it was like. In the direct aftermath some were there as much as they could be, I get it's hard to talk to someone who isn't very receptive to the idea that she's a good person who did a bad thing and not a complete and utter monster incapable of love/forgiveness. Nowadays not so much. Maybe once a week I'll get a ""hope you're doing good"" message from someone but that's it. I feel abandoned. And part of it is that they're still in the group and I'm not. They're still working on the same things and I'm not. and that proximity isn't there anymore. But I would hope that us being in our mid 20s-into 30s would mean that we were better than that, that we'd made some actual connection. but I guess not. Another part is that shit's been going down in some of their lives, and I've tried to be there as much as I could/felt was appropriate given my pariah status. But it just feels like shit. Feels bad that I try to be there for my friends as best I can but they cannot do that for me. That even before all this happened, if they were going through something bad or had a mental health break I'd be there for them. But...they can't be there for me. and I'm not sure if I can even feel mad or jealous or sad about it. They know what my worst looks like. It looks like completely disregarding their feelings and calling them an asshole in front of their friends and peers. It still hurts, it hurts that some people who I really thought would be my friend for the rest of my life don't really want anything to do with me anymore. I'm alone. No one talks to me anymore. My suicide ideation is back, which is a fun paradox because i've been watching my physical health very carefully and terrified that i'll die soon from cancer or something. I've tried going back to therapy, tried to be hopeful that things will be better and that me and the dude will be friends again, me and everyone else will be friends again. but each day passes without a word from anyone and I lose hope. I don't want to beg people to talk to me, to put them in a position where if they don't anything I'll do negatively is their fault. I've been there before and I don't want to do that anymore ever again. but that doesn't stop me thinking it. so i don't talk to them, and they don't talk to me cause i don't talk to them or the only things i can say are terrible jabs at myself. The only thing that kept me from feeling like a loser going nowhere was the group and what we were doing. I felt like I was doing something important. I felt like my friends loved me and that we'd be there for each other through anything. But without it and without my friends with me, I feel utterly lost. I am a loser going no where. Like I'm never going to learn and i'm just going to keep making the same mistakes over and over again. That maybe it's better to just be alone the rest of my life, not friends and no closeness. because at least then I wouldn't hurt people. I feel like a monster and it's only responsible to put myself in a cage."

44,vulnerability,BPD,Should I (24M) send this apologetic letter to my ex (29F) with BPD?,1,ekdb6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ekdb6w/should_i_24m_send_this_apologetic_letter_to_my_ex/,2020-01-06 00:57:08,"Hello, I am writing this post after my girlfriend broke up with me (after five months) during early November. The experience has left me decimated and utterly distraught that I have lost my best friend with whom I had such a joyous vision of the future. &amp;#x200B; For context I will describe events leading up to the split. This was a long distance relationship across a certain two countries in the British Isles and so, going into November, I had been living with her and using my time to look for jobs. &amp;#x200B; On the last night I was with her, as we lay in bed, she asked me why I seemed a little down. I replied by saying I sensed she wasn't feeling like her normal self, trying to show some concern for her (she had been away for the week and since returning seemed tired and despondent). She reacted by stating this was only for a couple of days, with which I agreed. I then said that I had not spent much time with her over the past week, merely trying to say that i'd missed her before I was due to leave the next day. She however interpreted this in an entirely unexpected way, calmly accusing me of saying a 'shitty thing' and being ungrateful for everything she provided for me. I was totally taken aback by this twisting of my own vulnerability, not intended as a personal attack, into something spiteful. &amp;#x200B; I pleaded with her to recognise that I did not mean any malice as she imagined it but it was clear her feelings were out of control as she met my saddened gestures with silence. Nonetheless I apologised and said goodnight, my own mind frantically searching for answers and not really comprehending what I had done wrong. This worry was only exacerbated by her leaving to sleep on the sofa some 20 minutes later. Assuming she was enraged at me, I prevented myself from approaching her and thought she would need space for a while (just as on the previous couple of occasions she felt triggered). &amp;#x200B; I should also explain that the first time she mentioned BPD potentially being a problem for her was only a few days before this incident. She was talking of a new plan to see a therapist twice a week and was complaining of feeling uncertain about her identity. By the time of the incident I had only just begun to construct any idea of what BPD actually entailed and certainly couldn't connect it to her sensitivity. &amp;#x200B; After I went home she said that she needed to some time to herself for a few days and I obliged. Three days later she messaged me saying that she doesn't feel able to be in a relationship at the moment as she feels 'unable to have conversations', that therapy had changed her perspective on things and that she wishes it could continue but she needs to focus on herself. She was keen for me to believe it wasn't my fault and dismissed my presumption that the above incident had any bearing on her feelings. I talk to her later and explain that her mental health doesn't affect the love I have for her and that whatever conditions she needs me to fulfill in order to support her I will gladly provide, but she is adamant recovering may take a while and me being so closely connected to her for perhaps up to a year would not be fair on me. We resolve to keep in touch. &amp;#x200B; Though I began to be crippled by self-doubt, suspecting that I had somehow made a big mistake to alienate her; what confirmed the veracity of her perspective was that she called me the next day, utterly devastated at feeling alone and then continued to message me over the following week viciously blaming herself for what happened. She would ask if my family hated her and berated herself for being 'a heartbreaker' by 'messing things up' and hurting me. I told her that my feelings for her hadn't changed and that her feelings were just a consequence of her being in a bad place. She called me the week after this to have a general chat and I assured her at the end that even though I was focusing on my own life to give her space, she is welcome to give us another go if she ever feels healthy enough to. I reiterated my boundaries again days later when she reassured me that nothing was my fault and that her negative frame of mind had been intensifying for a while prior to us splitting. Again I said that am just a phone call away if she needed support for anything, that I don't judge her for bravely wanting to confront her problems head on and that the door is open for her should she ever want to return. She still reaches out to me to ask how i'm doing (even if she is a little colder than before) and recently thanked me for the Christmas card I sent her. &amp;#x200B; The prospect of reuniting she has not directly addressed (aside from vaguely thanking me for all my assurances) but I assume if she was opposed to it she would have voiced that concern by now (her obviously avoiding sending back my camera/clothes after promising to do so may be further evidence of this). I still love her so much, she is the best person I have ever met and I try my best to show her unconditional support if and when she approaches me so that I don't smother her. &amp;#x200B; Lastly I want to say that I have been consumed by anxiety lately as the more I research BPD, the more I recognise how her few unpredictable reactions to things I commented on are explained by her torturous fear of rejection. Though she insists that nothing was my fault I feel a torturous pain that I couldn't assuage her fears and reassure her that I wasn't abandoning her because I didn't understand the dynamics of BPD at the time. I desperately want to apologise for this but am worried how this might conflict with the space I know she needs to heal. Hence I have written a letter to contain all my thoughts but I am not sure whether to send it. &amp;#x200B; Here it is: *Dear R,* *I write to you today with a dismayed heart and enlightened mind, dismayed because I feel I owe you a humble apology, yet enlightened for I have emerged from a painful period of soul searching with great clarity surrounding the dynamics of our relationship.* &amp;#x200B; *I recall that in the week before we split you referred to the possibility of suffering with Borderline Personality Disorder (forgive me if this wasnt a diagnosis). In recent weeks I have devoted much time to conducting thorough research of the condition in an effort, admittedly too late, to understand it better so that I may be equipped with the knowledge to help you in future. Briefly I must say that I feel immensely ashamed of my hesitant response to your revealing this fact, wishing now I had reassured you that my feelings for you remained undisturbed and that I had asked what support you required of me going forward. Truthfully, I too felt rather vulnerable at this time and this served to muffle my sentiment.* &amp;#x200B; *Aware of how intensely you berated yourself for what happened, perhaps seeing a depressive episode crafting a deep scepticism of your capacity to be loved, or maybe acting in the name of self-preservation, I feel obliged to explain my own faults so that some self-compassion may be restored to you.* &amp;#x200B; *My newfound understanding of BPD is of a condition fixated on the issues of abandonment, fear of rejection and often unconscious, impulsive reactions to imagined threats. These reactions reveal a hyper-vigilance for the appearance of anything that might resemble the various traumas that hurt an afflicted person from young age. Frankly, given the harrowing nature of many experiences you relayed to me, it is no surprise that your psychology may have been altered in this way, an exaggerated fear shielding you from terror. From what I have read, I think BPD is entirely misunderstood, with sufferers being seen as crazy to the extent of being deliberately malicious and those who have been wounded by its fallout railing viciously against maltreatment without any consideration of the unconscionable agony that causes it. This is an extremely damaging misconception that I assure you I do not hold.* &amp;#x200B; *There are two main aspects of our relationship that BPD explains, the first being the intensity/pace and the second being the few, sporadic moments of volatility that occurred between us. Generically the sufferer experiences a rapid idealisation of the partner that is eroded over time, flaws are recognised, and the disappointment felt is out of all proportion to the imperfection seen. In this way minor mistakes made by most are misinterpreted and used as evidence that a partner is now totally irredeemable, perhaps permanently. There is no grey area. Coping with these cycles defines the relationship. Im sure you know all of this through the treatment you are undergoing (super proud of you for this) and dont wish to describe events specific to us in too much detail lest that feel like an accusation.* &amp;#x200B; *I have accepted that I sometimes acted, though I meant well, as a co-dependent which probably amplified the symptoms of a dynamic that I was completely unaware of. In my caretaking of your every need I was carried away by unbridled infatuation and your openness and vulnerability, the passion and doubtless sincerity of which I found invigorating in my own yearning for love. The crucial error I made here was to see none of this as abnormal, my low self esteem and desire to avoid conflict led to me establishing poor boundaries that may not have led to the sense of safety you coveted. At times I loved being your sole source of support but can see how that wasnt healthy to maintain.* &amp;#x200B; *I placated, accommodated and apologised when I unwillingly released a trigger upon you in order to maintain harmony because I viewed each incident in isolation and genuinely believed I was helping you. Most shamefully of all, especially on the last night I saw you, I failed to see that your responses were borne of an anguish that I was rejecting you and I failed to reassure you that you would always be safe with me. Instead I became defensive, my usual empathy confused and startled at how anxiety about myself and missing you could cause such pain, then crumbling as I was oblivious of the traumas at play. Though you have dismissed the importance of this, I am deeply remorseful that I couldnt assuage your insecurities because I simply didnt understand the complexity of what tortures you daily. Had I more time I would have committed all my energy to learning how to manage your symptoms and how to set reasonable boundaries for the benefit of your own self-improvement. I would have learned to be more assertive, calming you and taking control in ways I did when I felt more stable and truly becoming the steady force you always wanted me to be. I think we both can agree that we both had the ability to be supportive and honestly talk about difficult feelings, but our own individual frames of mind thwarted us ultimately.* &amp;#x200B; *I want you to know that I could not possibly deride you for your condition, I realise that what you suffer with is ultimately a product of a cycle of misguided emotions, distancing and hurt across many generations. The growth of such mournful sorrow can only be extinguished by caring people who wield compassion as a weapon even against the most hostile of environments. I am reminded of what the character of Elliot (himself a reclusive person with chronic mental issues) says in season 4 of Mr Robot upon meeting his nemesis who is hell bent on world domination:* &amp;#x200B; *Society deserves to be hated for everything you said they did,* fuck *every last one of them. But then there are some people out there, and it doesnt happen a lot. But they refuse to let you hate them. They care about you in spite of it. The special ones, theyre relentless at it. Doesnt matter what you do to them, they take it and care about you anyway, they dont abandon you no matter how many reasons you give them. No matter how much youre begging them to leave. Because they feel something for me that I cant they love me.* *And for all the pain Ive been through, that heals me, maybe not instantly, but it heals me. We hurt each other and it gets messy, thats just us. Yet we stand, we break but we keep going. Thats what makes us.* &amp;#x200B; *When I listened to this a few days ago I was overwhelmed with emotion because it conveys my world view and reminds me of the love I tried to show you despite your myriad traumas and tender anguish. My love for you was truly unconditional and your pain doesnt detract from the fact that I saw and still see what a beautiful, curious, inspired, playful, inquisitive and intelligent person you are. A person beyond compare with whom I revelled in such an astounding commonality of interests, thoughts and means of fulfilment. One of those exceedingly rare individuals with the perfect antidote for the malaise generated by feeling different, with whom I shared countless meaningful and stimulating conversations that restored my faith in people. Someone with whom I had found a tribe.* &amp;#x200B; *Its clear I need to work on myself in some respects and you are on your own eminently sensible journey which I cant begrudge, but while we both do our waiting for Godot, dont think I have forgotten about you, no matter how much space grows between us. I apologise for unintentionally hurting you and for not doing enough to stem your fears. Whatever form our relationship takes in future, when were both in a better place, I promise you can always count on me as your loyal friend and I will always do my best to honour the faith you put in me.* &amp;#x200B; What encourages me to send it is the thought that she has demonstrated a degree of self-awareness, has not sought to denigrate me in any way and in fact has shown immense concern for my well-being in the aftermath of our split, something that contradicts much of what I have read on forums such as this. I believe that because of this she deserves a second chance if she pursues it in future. At the very least I want to remain on amicable terms with her and see this as a good way to tie up some loose ends while nullifying my fear that her denial of me causing all this is borne from not feeling comfortable discussing her condition. &amp;#x200B; Conversely I am wary of how this could constitute another trigger or cause her to further distance herself due to some paradoxical fear of someone showing genuine care and empathy. Above all I want her to know that I understand her better now and don't harbour any prejudice as a result. &amp;#x200B; What should I do? &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - long distance GF unexpectedly split up with me wanting to focus on her mental health, I have since understood much of her behaviour can be attributed to BPD and how I made mistakes in handling it, should I send a letter apologising for this/hoping for reconciliation at some point?"
45,vulnerability,BPD,Does anyone else feel a disconnect between their emotions and their rational thoughts?,1,en3uxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/en3uxr/does_anyone_else_feel_a_disconnect_between_their/,2020-01-11 17:15:43,"CW: Suicidal ideation near the end Before starting, I want to specify that I have not been professionally diagnosed with BPD. My last two therapists and my current case manager have all heard my symptoms and agree that I suffer from BPD, but Ive never been able to get someone who can actually diagnose me to take me seriously. My current diagnoses are GAD and MDD. With that said, does anybody else feel that there is a complete disconnect between emotion and logic in your mind? More than a disconnect, its like theyre two separate parts of my brain that I can never reconcile. When my symptoms are flaring up especially badly and/or when Im splitting, Im torn between extremes that I know logically dont make sense, but that has no bearing on my feelings or reactions. For example, earlier today I had a bad fight with two of my closest friends, one of whom is my FP. Ive been withdrawing from the other friend lately, due to feeling inadequate at being able to deal with or help with his severe mental health issues and all of the things that hes going through. I perceived that he started withdrawing from me first, and I kept more to myself in return. I didnt know how badly this was hurting him because he never said anything. My FP is closer to him than he is to me. Theyre pretty much the only person he talks to about anything, and theyd been encouraging me to try to talk to him more, which I have been. Today they got mad at me because my efforts havent been showing and nothing has changed, and it became an argument where both of them were angry with me and raising their voices. In the aftermath of this, Im incredibly conflicted. I recognize that Ive fucked up, but at the same time, I feel like its not being acknowledged that Im trying, even though they both said it matters that youve been trying, but trying isnt doing. Here are my thought patterns in a situation like this: 1. Im completely in the wrong, I fucked up, oh God, theyre going to leave me, I can never fix this, they have every right to be angry with me and upset with me, they probably hate me now, I can never face them again because theyre never going to forgive me and I dont deserve forgiveness. 2. Ive been trying really hard and Ive also been struggling really badly with all my mental illnesses, its completely unfair of them to blame me for everything because he doesnt talk to me about anything either, he never brought this up before now so how should I have known? I dont deserve their anger, fuck them anyway, if theyre going to treat me like this Im better off without them. 3. I should leave them and cut them off before they can leave me, I need to act like I dont care whether theyre in my life, and I need to play that part so convincingly that even I believe it, I dont care, so just fuck them. 4. I dont really not care, it all just hurts so fucking much but Im terrified to show any kind of vulnerability in front of either of them now, so Ill push them away even though it hurts when it works. Underneath all of this is the logical knowledge that none of these extremes are fully true or false, that its okay to be upset about the argument and still acknowledge that I messed up, that I know its irrational to react this way. But that little voice of reason is completely drowned out by the flood of all the other thoughts. I switch between these extremes within a matter of minutes or even seconds. I cant turn my brain off, not even for a moment, because the whirlwind of conflicting emotions is way too fucking loud and I cant ignore it no matter how hard I try. Im fucking exhausted and Im having incredibly bad suicidal ideation since that argument. I want to stop existing so I can stop hurting them, and so I dont have to feel this hurt anymore. I feel like Im going insane every time this happens, and I dont know how to make it stop. Does anyone else experience anything similar?"

We're both mentally ill. He's untreated and I'm on therapy and drugs. We're both on our lowest points so far in our relationship. We have been working on ourselves and on the relationship, which has suffered greatly as a consequence of our illnesses. Today we went out for a beer and we seemed to have the first ""normal"" date in a long time... or at least, getting back to our normal selves. We were trying to be there. During the day, he had suggested that we go to my favorite place on Saturday for lunch. I was looking forward to it since I'm YEARNING for a good weekend with him. The last few ones have been terrible and I'm stressed about my life and worried about our relationship and I thought we needed a time to reconnect and I just need a break and I wanted to relax with him and feel happy again, together. So at the end of today's date, he says that his friend has bought him a ticket for something on Saturday. He said that if I'd buy my own ticket, I could come with them. There come crashing all my illusions. I immediately split. I have been thinking for a while that everything in the relationship is about him. I'm sure he thinks the same about me. So then again I thought that I have no say, no opinion, that I'm invisible, that I don't matter, that I always come on second place after his friends. Why can't we have what I want just for once? I told him, ""I thought we were making plans together as a couple, but if that's how it's gonna be, then I'm going to hang out with my friends or whoever else asks me to do something that day."" Knowing damn well that I meant my shady, reckless, immoral friends. My only 'friends'. Yeah, I shouldn't have said that. Full hurt, full split. So I hurt him when I said that. And he tore apart a paper airplane he had given me. And he raised his voice. And he cried. Because he thinks he's never good enough for anyone. Those are his current insecurities all bottled up and coming out because of me and my words, because of my fault and my vulnerability and my insecurities. So then I felt guilty and ashamed. He'd be better off without me. I cried as well. So tired of myself and my mind. Thinking about how or when to break up with him as we hugged and held hands and wiped off our tears... thinking about when to leave so that I can stop making him bad about himself so that I can stop feeling invisible so that I can go back to my self-destruction. And so we said goodnight. He thinks we're gonna work things out. Meanwhile, I'm fighting against myself. I'm forcing myself to stay in the relationship just until I get my thoughts back together, just until I stop hurting so bad, and recoiling and attacking and trying to escape before he hurts me first. I'm trying my best to not contact my destruction-people. He'll never have an idea of how close I am to end all things right now. Or maybe he will. I want to be with him, but if it's gonna hurt, then I want to be alone."

49,vulnerability,BPD,Comorbid NPD here. Can anyone recommend a straightforward book about how to develop empathy?,1,etldus,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/etldus/comorbid_npd_here_can_anyone_recommend_a/,2020-01-25 14:20:07,"Hey, I'm currently doing DBT, but my comorbid narcissistic traits are interfering with group therapy, and I'm trying really hard to get a handle on it. I'm also encountering a lot of NPD stigma from the therapeutic team, which is super-harmful right now. So thanks in advance for not making it worse here (please). Anyway, Empathy seems like a cornerstone for me. Basically, ""true"" empathy (versus ""cold"" empathy) could be the mysterious missing piece that makes me feel inhuman inside, and makes me seem ""off"" to people. I would appreciate some book recommendations, if possible. Online, I'm finding a lot of lists about how to SHOW more empathy, but FEELING the emotion is supposed to be much more intuitive and immediate than ""ask gentle questions like, what can i do for you"" One helpful example I found this like this: &gt; Fine tune your nonverbal observation skills. Learn about micro-expressions (small quick facial expressions) and eye reading. Daniel Goleman in his book, Social Intelligence, states that the more sharply attentive we are, the more keenly we will sense another persons inner state. (From \[URL This article ""\[Give Your Empathy a Boost\](URL makes sense, too: 1. Be quiet, inside and out. 2. Fully watch as well as listen. 3. Ask yourself what you are feeling. 4. Test your instinct. If it is appropriate, when you are in conversation with someone else, tell the person what emotions you are experiencing. I also see words like ""curiosity"" and ""vulnerability"" come up a lot. I worry that if I didn't learn empathy as a child, I'm fucked. That can't be true, though (right?). I also read the subject presented as an all-or-nothing thing, where people either ""have"" it or don't (and are narc monsters), but that's definitely not my experience. For example, I have a daughter, and I definitely feel what she feels, even when it doesn't ""get"" me anything. I'm choosing to have faith that there is a tiny, but very real, strawberry-seed-sized kernel of empathy within me, that I can nurture and grow. Please help. I can't be irredeemable."
50,vulnerability,BPD,I'm a candle nearing the end of what I thought was an endless wick. (Thoughts from an FP),1,e841qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/e841qx/im_a_candle_nearing_the_end_of_what_i_thought_was/,2019-12-09 14:09:39,"Hi there. Gay 17-year-old guy coming at you from California (all that's relevant, I promise). Just to let you know, dear reader, this is gonna be a long one. Buckle up. To start off, I don't have BPD. I *do* have depression, anxiety, and what I've been suspecting is ADD, but I cannot speak about BPD firsthand. My exposure to it has been limited, over the course of two years, to my best friend with BPD, the content they've shown me in that time, and the research I've done on my own (which I'd say would be fair to call extensive). I've been on this thread once before, seeking assistance on how to be the best FP I could at the time. Since my best friend trusted me enough to bring the inherent nature of our relationship to my attention, I've taken my impromptu position seriously: learned their triggers; developed a sense for when they're upset, even when they're unresponsive or try to play it off; understood their boundaries and respected them as needed; treated their needs for phrasing as tactfully as possible; defused episodes and splitting the best I've been able in any given situation. None of that has ever felt out of obligation, because it's been out of nothing but a sheer, all-encompassing love for the best friend I could ever ask fornone of that, that is, until now. Let's jump back to how we met. Quick synopsis here so I don't talk your ear off before getting to the meaty part. Freshman year in high school. Advanced English 1. We sat at the same table but had only interacted intermittently, all pleasantries. Only after being paired to reconstruct a Shakespeare sonnet did they muster the courage to ask if I had an Instagram, and such was the start of the best (and wildest, inevitably) friendship of my life. We've been through the wringer. And the cheese grater. And the paper shredder. And maybe even the trash compactor. In two years, life has thrown what seems like everything it's got at us, and yet you apply some perspective to our position and you realize there's *so much more;* that's the terrifying part. For what I hope are obvious reasons, I'll be keeping their identity anonymous. That said, I *would* like to lay out some of the things that have hit us over the course of our relationship. Lay some groundwork for the issues plaguing us at this juncture. * Our first of a few ""incidents,"" as we've referred to them in order to avoid having to dig up everything they entail by name, is their suicide attempt. Their first and only in the context of our friendship. Not their first over the course of their lifetime, which stings to say. My memory is slippery, so I can't quite recall exactly what the catalyst was. All I can recall is fear and anxiety. Knowing my bus was coming, that my parents were expecting me home, and calling the police on the way to their house down the road from school anyway. They were admitted to a ward. Not given much other than a talking-to, which was the last thing they needed. But they were alive. And as much as I dislike framing it this way, I'd kept them that way. * There's a lot more to this than I'm able to summarize quickly, but here goes nothing. We were both falling into the Detroit: Become Human (a PS4 game revolving around androids in a futuristic Michigan) fandom. Falling *hard*. Shipping, Twitter stanning, the works. There's some overlap here with the first incident. According to my best friend, I took to Twitter more than ever after what happened, used it as a coping mechanism which unfortunately became its own source of trauma. After joining a Discord server for roleplaying Detroit and becoming friends with a member, a 20-year-old guy, it soon became apparent to me through someone on Twitter that there was not only evidence but *overwhelming* evidence that he was grooming people and generally being a *real* shitty human being. Finding that out didn't just shake me to my core, it *terrified* me in the moment. Roleplay was taking over my life. Along with that was the person (a 21-year-old guy) I'd stumbled into who was willing to ship their character with one of mine and take it somewhere suggestive. Then raunchy, and finally, somewhere explicit. I'll admit my writing skills and generally mature disposition lent itself to appearing of age, and being that he never asked, I didn't tell. Until I did, and in one fell swoop, I also told my best friend and a couple of other friends. I was too guilty to keep going. That was a huge scandal that could have *and should have* ended there, but I was younger. More naive, as nearly humorous as it might sound from a 17-year-old speaking about his 15/16-year-old self. I told my best friend I would stop with the sexual roleplays... but the guy in question managed to convince an already suggestible me into continuing to write with him. *You're the best writer I've ever seen*, was his reasoning, and he didn't want to lose that. Needless to say, I look back on that cringing with my entire body, especially recalling how I paid for a commission of our characters at a convention my best friend and I went to. I wince even more severely when I recall the day my best friend came across the conversation I was having with said guy on Hangouts through the iPhone we used to sharethey had no business being on my account, which they apologized to me for. I've since accepted and forgiven them. Reason to be there notwithstanding, they saw what had shifted from a roleplay involving characters to a roleplay very nearly involving *ourselves*, to make matters ever more uncomfortable. They found that and were beyond *hurt*they felt ***betrayed***, their trust ***shattered***. I'd never lied to them before then, and what a first lie to drop on them out of what felt like nowhere. They confronted me. I sobbed. We headed to the counselors' offices, since it was a school day, and used one of said offices to have some alone time. I'll never forget how, even after I'd pulverized every sense of trust between us and put myself in psychological vulnerability before a guy who had me at my knees, they comforted me while I broke down. Trust has since been a shaky value between us, but I'm thankful to say we've been able to mend it more than I ever thought possible. * This past summer was my first-ever romantic relationship. A guy in Honduras. I remind you that I live in *California*, so yes, this was a long-distance relationship. First red flag. The second is that, from the get-go, it could hardly be called a ""relationship"": built on one-sided flirting that became two-sided out of obligation more than anything (guess the sides! You'll never get it.), exclusive on one end and not the other (he never particularly considered us *boyfriends)*, out of more love for the fact of the relationship than each other. He and I got along, for the most part. As I often do, however, I spent a lot of the time just being hurt. Insecure. Generally unstable, and among some, er, *passionate* video calls and such, that's about everything either of us got from it. Even more distressing was the effect this was having on my best friend. Being their favorite person, our relationship is inherently codependent, and inherently based on them wanting me to provide them attention and love. I'm can guess BPs here know that jealousy buds when that attention and love is rerouted in any capacity to someone else. Such was the case with my best friend all throughout the month or two my significant other and I spent together. At its worst, they considered leaving for their own sake (""considered"" is by and large too tamethey threatened it in the middle of an episode) and I, later, had a panic attack when I realized the only healthy option for me was to break up with him. Only recently have I managed to let his memory settle, though with some turbulence when he wished me a sweet but unwanted happy birthday a little while back. * This guy and I broke up right before this school year began, and in the time before the first day of school, I posted on a friendmaking sub here in order to see if I could get some support. (Not the best thing to base a friendship on, I now realize, though I was pretty desperate.) Among a few connections I made, none particularly lasting, was a 36-year-old guy. Sound familiar? Yeah, unfortunately. We grew pretty close pretty quick, me confiding in him for support and such. Kind of as a father figure, except for the kinda sorta relevant fact that he was also gay *and told me he was attracted to me.* Being as insecure as I am, with my need to feel loved and validated, I responded to that by expressing that I was, too, and that was the start of a romantic undercurrent between us that I didn't see was *wrong and vile* until my best friend and some other loved ones in my life brought it to my attention that, once again, *I was being groomed*. Even after cutting off that connection, that kinda just... left me reeling. And didn't stop. I fell into a depression unlike any I'd known, this profound, seemingly bottomless sadness. When I was able to flounder out of *that,* anxiety set in. My point of contention became a narrative I'd created and let balloon about how having other friends would shatter my best friend's heart. After a conversation in the counselors' at school, one that was frankly rather embarrassing for me when I realized how much I'd overblown the issue, all became well... until it wasn't. With all that foundation laid, we get to the stuff that's been going on with, between, and around us lately. Since about my long-distance relationship, if not the romance thing with the older guy, we haven't felt quite natural. See, we used to video chat (Hangouts voice call, more like, but we've always called it a video chat) almost every day freshman year. We'd chat into the wee hours of the morning, sometimes, and always say good night. My humor is largely an offshoot of their love for obscure and confusing jokes and memes, and my music taste developed from theirs since I hardly had a music taste at all before we met. We're kindred souls*spiritually connected*, we like to say. At the core of us is love. And the one thing I want to make absolutely clear is that *that* hasn't changed. Lately, however, things have been... different. For a smorgasbord of reasons, many of which I can't even properly identify, I've been actively dissociating for the first time in my life versus the sporadic and quick periods of dissociation I'd suffered in the past. I've felt not only outside of myself but like I'm no longer able to be myself at all. Being as pedantic and fastidious as I am, I've also become obsessive about sentence structure and how I phrase my thoughts to the point where those thoughts feel forced. Metallic, pretty, but lifeless. There's little to no substance to what I say anymore, or it at least feels that way. Exacerbating that is the fact that I've felt few emotions but anxiety and dread for the past... month? My memory's been unreliable, too, with long-term memories feeling almost like lies I'm holding onto. As an aside, I should say that I haven't been in therapy at all over the course of my best friend's and my relationship. The last therapist I saw was when I was 13, and though I'm currently in the process of trying to get therapy through my school to work, it's slow going. The only consistent mental health assistance I've been getting has been from my counselor at school. Lovely lady, if limited by the nature of a counselor-student relationship. Certainly not licensed therapy. Perhaps most pressing in the immediate moment has been the fact that I'm entertaining the notion of an in-person relationship. Guy in Algebra. I broke the news, as awful as that is to say, to my best friend just the other day to a simply awful reaction. Make no mistake, that's in no way meant to blame themit came at not just a rough but a *dismal* time given the third anniversary of their mother's death was December 4th. If I'm entirely honest, though, I wasn't even a fraction of the comforting I know I can be (and have been in the past) during the episode they suffered. We haven't had a proper chat in a decent while now, and though I feel disgusting for this, we haven't said anything over Hangouts since Friday night. I just haven't been able to bring myself to text. Never have I felt so utterly disconnected from the world, and ***never*** have I seen myself so disconnected from them. It's not just killing me, I feel like I'm being corroded from the inside out. Writing all this out, I don't expect any be-all-end-all solutions, because I'd be a fool to think anyone can solve my issues but me. What I would appreciate, if anyone has the time or the insight to offer it, is some perspective. Some insight. *Something*. Because I have never felt more lost, and even considering emotional amnesia, I don't think that's a lie. To whoever reads this far, thank you. You're already helping more than you could ever know."

53,vulnerability,BPD,DAE on a few things: Controversial Theory for Cluster B. Can any other Cluster B's relate at all?,1,e953s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/e953s5/dae_on_a_few_things_controversial_theory_for/,2019-12-11 20:51:15," Posted this in a few other places, interested to see what everyone thinks! TL;DR - I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder, on a spectrum. I have Borderline Personality Disorder and I advocate for mental illness, especially Personality Disorders. In advocating, I have talked to so many people with Cluster B Personality Disorders, and was shocked to find so many similarities in our behaviors--even when it doesn't appear to be the same on the surface. I have honestly not encountered anyone with HPD, so, I can't speak for them. I wonder if Cluster B Personality Disorders are all the same disorder that just exists on a spectrum. BPD, NPD, ASPD can all have antisocial or pro-social behaviors, they all can have high or low functioning sufferers, all can have classic or quiet symptoms, can all have vulnerability vs. grandiosity. We can all be victims or abusers, all have object permanence issues, we all seem to have an underlying trust issue, etc. For instance, most of us have issues with identifying what we are feeling, or if we are feeling anything at all. Borderlines are known for feeling such intense feelings, but there are also times when we feel absolutely nothing at all. Narcissists seem like they could go either way, be very emotional or not be emotional at all and seems like even the same person can be both. People with ASPD are also capable of feeling emotions, but not very intense, and sometimes, I think they have the same problem where they are ""feeling"" something, but can't identify it, and don't consider it an emotion or feeling. We all seem to get the edgy feelings inside us that we don't know how to identify, don't know what causes it, and we all know that we can do certain things to kind of make those feelings go away. Borderlines seem to attention-seek (which is sometimes a form of manipulation). Narcissists seem to manipulate. ASPD seems to manipulate. But it seems like some people with ASPD and NPD attention-seek through their manipulation. I think that a friend that I have with ASPD trolls online to get ""stimulation"" as he puts it, to fill that edgy feeling. I think that is almost a form of attention-seeking? I think all of us feel nothing because during childhood development none of learned to identify what those feelings were. We feel sensations instead of emotions, but have no idea those sensations are actually caused by chemical releases and causing emotions. We feel an ""sensation,"" sometimes the edginess, and we behave in a way to make that sensation go away. We never learned appropriate coping skills as kids, and never learned to identify what those feelings were to fix them anyways, so we act impulsively, without regard to others, because we just need that feeling to go away. All three PDs have the impulsive element. I think Borderline attention-seeking could be considered manipulative because we want superficial attention in those moments. We just want people to tell us they love us and they are there for us, and we move on because that shitty feeling goes away. That seems kind of manipulative. We are using people's compassion and empathy to make ourselves feel better. Because we never actually fixed the underlying problem that we were attention-seeking about, we continue to attention-seek. That's why that is such a repeated behavior. When we get real help for certain problems, we don't have attention-seeking problems in those areas. Cluster B's, I learned recently, are all known for our object permanence issues. When people aren't a constant in our lives, we tend to forget about them and our feelings for them lessen. When they show back up, it's like they never left, we feel the same way we did about them previously, positive or negative. We seem to all have underlying trust issues, which honestly seem to be what gets in our way of getting better. We can't trust anyone enough to tell them what we are actually thinking and feeling because it's so out there, or fucked up, or whatever, so we don't process that thought, and it never goes away. We never deal with it. I admitted a lot of things to my Favorite Person/partner (FP) recently, a lot about shitty behaviors I have had, and it gave me a tremendous amount of closure. He is the person I trust the most, but I still have trust issues around him. I trust him with my life, I know he would never do anything to hurt me, he is neurotypical, but I don't think I could ever just... trust him, even though I say I do. I also feel comfortable and trust him enough to ask questions about what is normal. I asked him, ""Is it normal to just not feel an emotion all the time?"" I assumed other people just always feel something, but apparently, they don't. Lol. Good to know. I asked him, do you always feel love for me? And he said he always loves me, but it's not a constant feeling. It's only when he thinks of me, or when something reminds him of me, or when I am around. I continued to ask him questions, and I figured out that my emotions, though seemingly limited and intense, aren't that irregular. Like, feeling nothing is normal. Feeling empty is not. I think the feeling empty is when there is an emotion or feeling there that we can't identify and don't know how to fix, and it's confusing for us to deal with. I think all disorders experience this on some level, but Borderlines are hard on themselves, so I think we feel empty, because we think really hard about it and dwell on it. Some NPD and ASPD folks do too, but seemingly not as much, but the ones that do seem to have feelings comparable to emptiness. Insightful and self-aware people with ASPD even seem to in their own way. Pro-social, high functioning NPD and ASPD is known for being charming and intelligent and being able to lure people in so they can manipulate them. Well, manipulation in someone with a PD is a survival mechanism from childhood development, so? Borderlines don't get the same distinction because we are vilified the same way as NPD and ASPD, but when we are in a positive, stable mood, we are very likable. We are usually all very good at making friends, we just can't keep them. Can't maintain the friendships. NPD and ASPD are labelled as calculating, but you would be about a symptom that you developed during childhood? You'd be an expert by now. You are very good at what you do. So are Borderlines. We are also good at luring people in and making feel bad for us and emotionally manipulating them to get what we want. We don't do it to be mean, we do it because we need something and don't know how to ask for it. I think NPD and ASPD is the same, but less empathy development, so it comes off as malicious. Being charming and calculated doesn't fit the victim role that Borderlines tend to take on in life, so, we don't get that distinction. I think that's interesting. Especially because I have been told by multiple people, ""Well, yeah, if you're a hot girl with childhood sexual abuse, you are probably Borderline."" Misconception, but... still, perceived to be the hot girl who can lure people in. I think that there *is* a spectrum, and there *is* different presentation, and all the genders *do* present differently, so it makes it look vastly different, but it's really not. We all do similar things for similar reasons. They just present differently. Also, you might say, well, there are certainly people out there who don't feel like I do? Who don't value the same things I do? Well, were the same things emphasized during childhood? In the same ways? Probably not. But I'm sure your disorder relates more with the people in your disorder who did. Especially the people in your category of your disorder. People who didn't have any emphasis on empathy during their childhood wouldn't have any. If they didn't have emotional development, they *would* feel less than those who did. The areas of the brain grow as be learn empathy and emotion. I reckon that we have the same disorder with different development of brain structure do to learning and experience. Some of us are very confident, some of us are not. Probably something to do with how we were treated during childhood, and then maybe even eventually how we were treated during adulthood and when we were testing boundaries, we developed new ""survival mechanisms"" that started to work in our new environment. All our behaviors are there because they work. The ones from our old environment that stopped working, we stopped doing because they didn't get reinforced. I think we are always testing boundaries because we don't always know what is acceptable, and new things wind up working. All of our behaviors have been continuously reinforced by society, even unknowingly. This isn't an excuse. We do have control over our behaviors to a point. I think we *do* loose control when we are unstable because we have poor impulse control and we can't identify what is going on because things happen a lot faster when we are escalated. But, when we are stable, we *are* able to realize what we are doing and how it affects ourselves and others. Gaining insight helps in those moments. We can't control our personality, but we can control our behaviors. I am mostly asking this because I want to raise points about trends in our behavior that mental health care professionals haven't noticed yet, to encourage research. *This* is an exceedingly long post, but it mostly made additional points. If you want to see more of what I am figuring out, then read [this](URL It's *very* long. This specific theory on Cluster B PDs is at the end. Can any of you relate to this? Or add to it?"
54,vulnerability,BPD,DAE feel superficially extremely extroverted but emotionally extremely introverted?,1,eaz30n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/eaz30n/dae_feel_superficially_extremely_extroverted_but/,2019-12-16 00:44:11,"I'm never quite sure what to answer when people ask me if I'm introverted or not. On the one hand, I know I'm very introverted - I have trouble opening up about my feelings to individuals, can write about them better than I can talk, and usually withdraw from people that try getting too close. I need the internet as an outlet for the things I can't express to anybody I actually know. I've been described at my last clinic as ""shy as a mouse"" and ""always hiding behind others"". I keep to myself and observe rather than commenting on most events. I have trouble asking people to lend me an open ear even if they've told me it's okay to do so. I cope with emotions by withdrawing, introspecting and daydreaming. I sometimes lie or make up excuses to avoid talking about sensitive issues, especially in the form of pretending everything's fine when it's not. At the same time, I know that I'm sort of .. superficially very extroverted. I have an easy time engaging with other people (as long as it's to talk about *them*, and not me) and often found myself being the first person to approach strangers who I thought needed help fitting in; or volunteering for embarrassing things - often by pointing out how ridiculous they are or making jokes of the matter. The moment I feel even the slightest bit comfortable and accepted, I have an easy time speaking in front of others or being the center of attention - as long as the things I'm speaking about present me in a vaguely good light rather than painting a picture of my internal struggles. During most of school, I was always considered the ""class clown"". At social gatherings / work I energetically converse and seem to enjoy creating attention, almost no matter the cost. (To the point of saying completely stupid things or acting goofy constantly, never being serious for even a bit). At the same time, I know that this is a fragile shield because I respond to even minor or *perceived* criticism with getting agitated/flustered and desperate attempts to change the topic of conversation; as if to avoid showing even the slightest sign of weakness or vulnerability. It almost feels like being two different people, like I've built up a powerful ""false ego"", a sort of over-inflated self-confidence that I slip into when I want to project an image of said self-confidence towards others? I suspect my goofy and outrageous, almost histrionic behavior is a defense mechanism against letting anybody *actually* close to me. It's especially bad when I know that people are watching whose approval I'm struggling to get; and often slip back into my ""shy"" mode of operation the moment somebody important to me is no longer present. I used to take it as a sign of be being manipulative, having a fragile ego, and obsessed with my own image - and ended up self-diagnosing it as NPD (triggering a major crisis); but I've since learned that this misdiagnosis couldn't be further from the truth. Does anybody else feel this same sort of contrast between ""unnatural""/histrionic extroversion and extreme introversion?"

56,vulnerability,BPD,Relationship history of being taken advantage of?,1,ehxkuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ehxkuc/relationship_history_of_being_taken_advantage_of/,2019-12-31 15:07:23,"Any young ladies here ever experienced an older, narcissistic man making advances on you? I am 30 and my 20s as an undiagnosed ""quiet"" BPD were a total trainwreck of older men (55+) detecting my emotional vulnerability and preying on me. I never experienced a healthy young man being attracted to me, and never been in a ""real"" relationship. BPD/NPD relationships are very common because the narcissist is looking to control, and the narcissistic supply with BPD fears being abandoned in the relationship and thus puts up with the dysfunction. We are easy bait due to our impressionability, and possibly our trauma history involving abusive or absent fathers, and it ends very bad, very traumatically. The only relationship I ever had was being swept away as a 23 year old, by a 59 year old narcissist who love-bombed/idealized me. I was on the board of the directors at a nonprofit and just after meeting him, was given long, poetic letters stating he never ""met anybody like this before"" and ""I've been waiting for you my entire life."" The endless shower of compliments, expensive gifts and dinners, and proposals to take me on trips across the country were too much to handle for somebody like me who has been emotionally and physically abused my entire life, and never had any friends. I never had anybody talk to me like this before, so positively. This man I didn't know was saying he never had a connection like this before, and he wanted to marry me. I later found out that the first four months he was pursuing me, he was still in a long-term relationship (with a psychologist of all people!). I ended up being in a relationship with him for 4 years and he took my virginity, part of his plan, even though I never wanted a sexual relationship. He controlled and emotionally abused me, and threatened to leave me if I had my own interests and wanted to do something on my own. The last 8 months of the relationship, he began devaluing me and the things he used to love about me were now being criticized. He suddenly announced he ""needed space"" and basically stopped showing up the the relationship. On my birthday, he cut off all contact with me and threw me to the curb like a piece of expendable trash. I found out that just days later, he was traveling around the country with a beautiful blonde I never seen before. A month later, he proposed marriage to her. I was still trying understand, just being recently abandoned. He consistently slammed social media with dozens of photos, and my friends and his family (who I established relationships with), were commenting how wonderful and happy they looked together. I lost my entire support network as they took his side, and these were the only people I ever had in my life. Shortly after being abandoned, a 65 year old and married writing coach I hired out to help edit my book kissed me without my consent. That was the last straw for me and I haven't been back to this horrible space since. DBT has helped me learned how to develop boundaries and recognize unhealthy relationships."
57,vulnerability,BPD,Learning not to take mental shortcuts.,1,du042v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/du042v/learning_not_to_take_mental_shortcuts/,2019-11-10 06:00:27,"My live-in partner is out with a friend right now. He told me several days in advance, weve seen each other a lot lately, connection is good. 2 years ago I had a nervous breakdown and got a LOT of very good help. My symptoms are minimal. But, our relationship recently took a step forward when we moved in together. That means more vulnerability, which is great because I love the intimacy, but making myself vulnerable in a new context always gets the protective BPD dogs growling. So, while Im hunkering down in this emotional thunderstorm, I thought Id describe what Im doing. Maybe itll help someone else. Preventative  the first things I ask myself are am I taking my meds? Am I rested? Hydrated? Where am I in my menstrual cycle? Knowing the answers to these questions gives me the best chance of staying grounded while the emotions sweep over me. Grounding  in order to make good decisions that are in line with values, I need to stay in Wise Mind. (a concept from DBT). The thing that helps me get back to Wise Mind the quickest is grounding. This can be meditation, somatic exercises, mindfulness exercises, or just feeling my feet on the floor. Make myself as comfortable as possible while watching the storm roll in. My emotions, though less overwhelming than they used to be, are still unwieldy, especially anything related to fears of abandonment. Living through them is not pleasant; in fact, its painful. Hard. But, living through ruined relationships and hurting the people I love is hard, too. Sometimes the best you can do is choose your own hard. So, back to tonight. Its a common pattern for me to try to avoid painful or uncomfortable emotions by finding an external rational thing that could be causing them, and then trying to fix THAT. That has never, ever, ever worked for me in the past, so I dont do that anymore. I also know, from my recovery, that my life goes best when I focus only on what is my responsibility. Thats my own thoughts, emotions, words, and actions. That means I will not be coping with these uncomfortable feelings by focusing on things that are my partners domain (his thoughts, emotions, words, and actions.) I will not be asking him when he will be home. I will not be indulging in fantasies about what he might be thinking or saying or doing, or what he might say or think or do in the future. Off limits. The next most tempting coping mechanism is trying to rationalize my emotions away. Just stuff them right down. Try to tell myself that Im not having the feelings Im having, because they dont make sense. That has never, ever, ever worked for me either  and in fact, it has a 100% record of backfiring. I know where that street goes, and so I will not be going down that street, either. Heres where I start getting grumpy, because, to be honest? My abandonment fears have become BORING to me. They get stirred up, they flood over me, I stay grounded and feel them all the way into the corners, move them through my body somehow (crying, dancing, showering, meditation, tearing newspaper, driving and yelling in the car...whatever the occasion calls for. And then...they go away again. They recede. Because Ive built a stable foundation in a safe place. The flood will pass, and Ill be standing. So feeling the full force of my emotions is...annoying. I wish there were a shortcut. Hell, I wish there were some kind of off switch or volume button. And maybe Ill find it some year. For right now, Ill stick with what works and ride out the storm."

This entire week has been a show show for her and weve both been going through it, more so her. But tonight, I felt like she unleashed everything shes been holding in about me and everything else thats fucked in her life and she released it all on me. Were semi long distance and see each other once a week for a couple of hours. I see her 4x out of the month &amp; when I do see her. sex is kinda an expectation. even if its not full fledge sex I just like to be touched intimately. Our relationship is pretty dry when it comes to sex and I tried explaining to her that sex is part of my love language. She feels as if it shouldnt be a priority in our relationship. Last night we were together and she refused to do anything sexual bc she was tired, mind you we talked about and had plans to do so because Im getting surgery soon and next month is just a busy month for both of us, realistically I dont know when Ill see her again. She just wanted to be innocently touched and took a nap on me, for an hour. I was extremely disconnected last night and I knew it would trigger her so the next morning I wrote out a long paragraph explaining why I was so distant and I apologized for it. Ive been working hard to keep my emotions under wraps because I know it triggers her episodes. Ive been working on my communication and anything remotely healthy thatll improve our relationship. I used to just shut down and avoid any type of confrontation now I stand up for myself. The message this morning was extremely nice, I was literally typing in a way that I thought shed perceive well. Making sure there was no passiveness or aggression. At the end of the message I even told her I loved her and just wanted to get this off my chest because I could see if affecting me and thatll affect our relationship...she reacted so incredibly negative to it. She completely flipped on me. Shes been arguing with me through text all day. Im surprised I handled it as well as I did with my BPD, therapy must be working because I was surely triggered as hell. I told her that I was starting to split and question our relationship &amp; im voicing it now because I wanted her to know where my head is at. She told her that I made her feel crazy and worthless as a partner. That I was wrong for wanting to have sex and expecting her to want to whenever she sees me. She completely switched and it was a shit show. I wanted to badly to disassociate and let my mind go elsewhere but unfortunately I was present for it all. I held o pretty strong up until a few hours ago. I thought we moved past it, she said she didnt care anymore and that she was over it. Then 45 minutes later she brought it back up demanding answers and shaming me. She knows Ive gone through sexual trauma and used that as her means for being upset with me for prioritizing sex over all else. She thought I was using her as a body, I viewed her as a piece of meat. She thought sex couldnt be part of my love language because I used to have sex and not give a fuck about the people I was doing it with. She didnt understand that sex was never a love language for me before because I didnt love the people nor did I have feelings for them. With her she introduced me to something that felt warm and fuzzy. She made me feel safe and allowed me to be vulnerable, allowed me to move at my own pace. Although I was a complete nympho I was never comfortable with my body so when it came to sex I usually disassociated and laid there allowing things to be done to me. With her Im down for everything. Everything I wasnt comfortable doing, Ive gained the courage to do with her. I love our sex. Then we stopped having it and my sense of self worth started to dwindle. I thought she didnt want me anymore. I was sad as hell over it. I voiced it and she blew up on me. My heart kinda hurts right now. I was so patient and understanding, using all my therapy coping skills to defuse the situations and they were all futile. It made me want to crawl back into my shell and never mention how Im feeling again. I finally reached vulnerability and she made me feel like shit for expressing my needs. She told me that my hyper sexuality isnt normal and that I needed to seek help for it. She just kept berating me until I had no fight left in me. We hung up and I texted her trying to explain further. Then she started questioning my motives and why Im so sexual with her. I called her back and did my best to explain it all, from the insecurities to now. I completely broke down. Thats when it finally hit her. Hearing me break down and cry because I was that exhausted of her. I couldnt even talk because I was so upset. She finally stopped sounding like a condescending bitch and started speaking in her normal tone trying to tell me to stop crying. Its very rare that I get so upset I start crying but shes been pushing me to that point all week. She got a family call and had to take it, but texted me to stop crying and told me she loved me. I explained how she made me feel and how it wasnt okay. It finally clicked for her and she knew she fucked up. She apologized several times and told me we were going to work on us. She also told me that she was projecting her feelings from the past week onto me &amp; it all just out directed at me. My heart hurts so bad. I dont know how to take any of this. Im just sad. I finally see the ugly end of bipolar relationships that people talk about. I cant feel how Im feeling right now. Shes made me question myself all day today and I truly started to believe that I was in the wrong. I dont even know what to do anymore."

A few weeks past and then all of a sudden the switch flicked again. I'm not even sure what triggered the recent change besides the fact that a lot of my other issues cleared up. Either way it's a total 180 and I feel like a huge awful idiot. We were together for a year. We were best friends! Our lives were super entwined, we talked about getting married. He knew about my BPD and accepted me anyway. A few weeks ago I felt like I wanted nothing to do with him; now it's like I've woken up and the thought of losing him forever makes me want to cry. Im not sure what to do; I know there's a medium between smotheringly groveling like an idiot or ignoring my feelings and moving forward but I can't even find the middle ground in my brain. I'm also too petty and emotionally immature to be rejected and I'm afraid of that too. We've talked recently and it was good but he's a bit hard to read sometimes. Ughhhh.

I struggle with jealousy towards women who appear ""better"" than methat is, easily possessing what I've always lacked, yet covet. *Love. Beauty. Understanding. Normality. Acceptance.* I often feel like the Little Match Girlhuddled in the snow, hands cupped around a dying match, as I watch other girls snug by their blazing hearths. And I'm struck with a childish sense of unfairness and futility: ""What is wrong with me?"" I only began DBT last month, and logically, I realize these thoughts aren't healthy. At the same time, we know *far too well* how horribly emotions can spiral when faced with stress/""crisis."" Last autumn, I briefly dated this boy (a former FP I never fully got over). Three weeks ago, he created a Facebook. My account is synced with my phone contacts, and naturally, he popped up as a Recommended Friend, like a digital home intruder. *And* he had found a girlfriend. My stomach tightened. In his picture, they looked happy in a way I'd never be. The next night, over dinner, I told my friend ""J."" She was curious to see, and I pulled out my phone. My stomach lurched again at the sight. She was pretty. Red hair, blue eyes. My hair was dyed copper last year. I wondered if my Ex-FP had a redhead fetish, and here I was, not even a real redhead. My stomach lurched again. Her blue eyes bore into mine. ""What*ever*,"" I sighed, putting my phone away. ""She's not even *that* cute anyways."" Last summer, a boy ghosted me when he meet a girl ""out of his league."" I sobbed to my friend, ""Is she prettier than me?"" He calmly told me, ""Eh, she's alright? Not my type,"" and didn't push the issue further. Neither did I. Not J. ""No, oh my God, she's actually *soooooo* cute!"" she exclaimed. Her reaction caught me off-guard. My hackles raised. *Cuteprettybetterthanme*. ""No, she's not!"" I retorted, defensive. ""Yes. She. Is!"" she insisted, smiling. It went back and forth like this, a couple more times, my stomach sinking further and further, until J said, aggressively, ""You're just jealous! You shouldn't tear other women down! Why do you need to tear other women down? They look happy together...be happy for them...just because she's dating \[Ex-FP\] doesn't make her *not* cute!"" At that point, I went silent and stared at my lap. I couldn't look at J. I felt tears coming. Why was it *so fucking important* for J to force me to acknowledge that the GF was *cute*? Were women's rights going to roll back to 1955 if I didn't? The way she acted, you'd think it would. I felt humiliated. I should've never showed her the photo. Hell, I never should've raised the topic. If I was more articulate, I would've said, ""Why can't you allow me *one fucking moment* of vulnerability without pushing pop-feminist catchphrases on me?"" (I support feminism, I'm just so fucking sick of my friends cluelessly pushing ""strong independent woman""-style catchphrases on me when I'm in pain from abandonment/dealing with FP obsession, with the implication that it makes me weak and I should just get over it! Like, the last time I even heard that phrase, I freaked out so bad that nobody has said it to me again since.) J then got quiet. She looked guilty. I don't recall what she said then, I was too swept away by emotion to hear her. So I wiped my tears, swallowed the hurt, and continued floating in a light stream of conversation, cracking jokes as I frantically bailed out the water rushing in. Stupid me. Why do I always do this? Why am I a spineless coward? In the weeks since, I've ""split"" multiple times on her and my entire social circle. My mind cherry-picks and uncontrollably vomits up memories of all the times I felt invalidated by my friends (they can be.....obliviously neurotypical, logical, uncomfortable with emotions. It's not malicious, I think it genuinely doesn't occur to them.) Yet, my extreme thoughts race out-of-control, black-and-white: *They'll never understand you. These people have no empathy. Ditch everyone! Block everyone! Leave the city! Find new friends!* I never told J how I felt that night. Deep down, I believe she is a well-meaning person, just a tad unaware of how her words soundbut hey, it was one time and nobody's perfect! But when I lay alone in my apartment, edging dangerously into splitting territory, her words stick like a thorn in my mind. I've considered telling her, in a nice and non-confrontational manner, but I also fear becoming that Toxic Friend who dredges up petty shit. But it's going to bother me down the line if I stuff it inside. Also, this is not the first time I've been in such a situation. I've bottled up *so much*, and lost friendships when I finally exploded. I don't want to repeat history. Am I overreacting to a little thing? What do I do?"

Apparently, I have a very ""complicated"" personality and ""chaotic"" energy about me, that is noticeable right away, and that intensifies as they got to know me. My friend said that when she first met me she felt like she had been ""confronted by 1000 different puzzle pieces and was trying to fit them all together""; when she said that, the others all enthusiastically agreed in unison. I am amazed that I had this impression on her, and that the other's agreed, because that is exactly how I feel about myself all the time. 1000 different puzzle pieces. My other friend said her first impression of me was that I was ""too much""; she said she had couldn't follow my train of thought or predict what I was about to say. That same girl said that she was struck by my intensity and vulnerability though it made her uncomfortable. My best friend said I was the most chaotic, complicated, psychologically interesting person she knew. In the same vein, I once overheard a professor say to another professor that there was something ""un-tranquil"" about me. And an ex-boyfriend remarked to me on our first date that one of the reasons he was attracted to me was that I was one of the only people he could not fit into a box/type. It's funny because I'm not mysterious at all, either. I am talkative to a fault and wear my heart on sleeve. Though what they are saying resonates with me deeply, and was oddly flattering, I was a bit surprised. I thought for sure my most distinctive feature at least at first was my timidity, self-effacement and validation-seeking, probably because I am constantly reminded by others to stop apologizing and to believe in myself. I was wondering if anyone could relate and if you think it's related to your BPD or something else."

I have had people lie to me before in life and one particular experience has definitely left a big scar, but that particular event is something I have been working on and living with for more than 6 years now, successfully being open about it and being able to establish other relationships. I have had some trouble assimilating with my new environment when I arrived at a new workplace a few months ago and I think this triggered the paranoia that has been intensifying for the past few weeks. Even after the forementioned experience I've had, I've never lost trust in people and for me it was always a fresh start whenever I met someone new, never expecting anyone having bad intentions (really childish, but everything is trial and error for me again and again). There was this episode cca 3 months ago when a coworker turned out to be two-faced about a serious situation that made me break down at work. I found my close friend/roommate OD'd at our flat and her mom called me to work the next day to tell me they still haven't been able to make get her vital signs, she was now officially in a comatose state - she woke up a few days later. My coworker, actually she's my manager, saw something was wrong and asked me if I wanted to go out to talk, offered me water and tissues. I broke down in front of her because I was so messed up. The only two people I was close with was my friend and roommate who was now in a coma and my now ex-boyfriend who I broke up with after he refused to come over after she was carried out of the apartment because it didn't fit in his plans for the night. It was a very terrifying night alone as I couldn't move, I felt paralyzed. There were those two, and there was this fresh job, those were the things my life was orbiting around. I couldn't keep my tears in. I told my manager what happened and she was the most understanding person in the world, gave me some great practical advice about finding a new place asap, mentioned she had something similar happened to her too, we talked about friendship and everything. The next day, I was warned by her ""not to bring personal issues to work"" and too just put on a smile and work through it, just like she does, I quote ""with all her problems"". She didn't say it in a friendly way. It was hard for me to swallow because the company I work at is really small and they insist on honesty and friendship between coworkers (other stuff has happened later to make me realize it's a very toxic environment and I am looking for a new job). And to this day, I stigmatized by my manager and bosses seeing me as someone who cannot keep their shit together. This is so long I'm sorry. After that happened, at one point we were told by this manager that we are constantly secretely being tested in everything we do because she is ""just waiting for someone to fuck up"", and she said it in a threatening way. I am saying this because this is when my paranoia started developing. First it was about her, I just can't trust her anymore, although I am currently forced to be around her every day and cultivate this insincere friendly atmosphere at the workplace. But then I started doubting my other colleagues, even the ones that helped me get through the situation with the manager... Then with my friends, even my closest friends, it's like my opinion on the way people ""work"" in general has shifted. I see a deeper motive in everything anyone says or does to me. I feel like I am going crazy. I am splitting all the time and simply cannot feel myself around people anymore. I've always went through life with my gut, and sometimes it was wrong but it never escalated to this level. Now my gut just tells me no, no, no. No, a big no. It's easier to be with people I've known for years because we have factual history together. But I moved to another city and I am around my colleagues all day, when I get home it's my rommate whom I've also met only a few months ago, and it's just constant no, no, no. Saying something honest and showing vulnerability then NO. Why did you do it. It will be used against you. With my romantic interest, it's simply hell. I just can't. I can't. Can I please have someone's opinion on this. I know it can't be right. I mean I don't want to think it's right because it makes me think dark thoughts. As everyone does, I will eventually get disappointed in something but I don't want it to cause an episode. I feel like I'm losing it. I am so lonely and so lost."

Until yesterday, when he said he didnt love me and wasnt sure how long it would take to love me, or if he would ever love me at all. However, this is his first relationship ever, and I knew he would need extra time to open up going into this (we had been friends for a few years prior). We both have mental health issues (anxiety, depression), but we havent shared any specifics beyond that. I have bipolar ii and bpd, (and ocd, adhd, panic disorder, phobias, currently developing mild agoraphobia) and Im currently undergoing a 2 month long, 10 session, therapy program for ptsd. I was just recently diagnosed with bpd, and I will (hopefully) begin an 8month program later this year or next, after ptsd therapy. I have worked so hard my entire life to not let bipolar rule my life, only to realize I was battling the wrong demon. I was supposed to show him this little packet about common reactions to trauma (per my ptsd therapist) and I dont even think its worth delving into now. I was going to share with him very personal shit in the next few weeks: physical, emotional, financial abuse in my family home, over a year of sexual abuse from an ex, the details of my 2 hospitalizations a couple years ago, my diagnoses. Notably, every time I have opened up to an ex (I keep it to a 1 minute brief overview - its all they can handle), theyve broken up with me within a week. Its a super touchy subject, especially since I go very VERY out of my way to not let my SO become wrapped up in my world of trauma and sadness. Its like as soon as they see Im broken (through no fault of my own, this I know), they run for the hills. In the last 24 hours, Ive gone back and forth on whether or not to just end things immediately, or continue in a relationship knowing Im not loved because my partner has recently been unable to provide me with the emotional intimacy I need (I.e. he has issues with eye contact, weve discussed and he says it makes him uncomfortable but he also discussed with his therapist that eye contact is healthy and normal). I cant tell if I feel crazy because of my illness, or if this is something valid enough to break up with him over. Also, important to note... Ive dated some real shit bags. This man is not one of them. Although he definitely fails when speaking to me about romantic matters, he is the most empathetic person Ive ever met. He is kind, brilliant, giving, happy, adventurous, hilarious, and even if he wasnt any of those things I would still love him. Hes the first person Ive ever been able to date and remain stable, hes the only person Ive ever considered having a future with because we both dont want kids. (Every other male Ive encountered... lol, we cant even talk about my not wanting kids, or else Im immediately demoted to I cant see a future with her.) Im not sure if I just needed to vent so I could get over it, or if Ill snap back to wanting to breakup because I CANNOT handle vulnerability, in any form really other than sex. So, yeah... Were going to a movie in a few hours with his friends- time to collect myself and meditate in hopes that I can neutralize my brain chemistry for the day, until I can come home and take my nighttime meds. Sometimes I just cant tell if i need to remove myself completely, or ride out the waves of crazy, so to speak"

Lately I've been fixating a lot on clean slating my life, leaving my partner, home, creatures, family, friends, everything, and starting all over again. I think in part this is because I hate all sign of anything less than great. This often leads me to giving up projects quickly because I am embarrassed by the act of learning and the vulnerability learning opens me up to. This also leads me to spending a lot of my finances trying to achieve 'great'. I'm embarrassed to exercise as I'm not a excelling, I'm embarrassed to cook in case my partner doesn't like the food, I'm embarrassed to try anything new.

I had so many suspicions, going back to February, March, April, up until our anniversary in June, when I found an empty box of condoms in his car. They weren't for me. I had an IUD and was naive to believe that we were monogamous. I let it slide after a heated argument. But then later checked his phone and read his texts with another woman. She sent him a nude. The texts laid out their plans to see each other and confirmed that the condoms were for their encounter. I was devastated. What happened to loving me? He said it was a one-time thing. I knew it was a lie. But because he started crying and telling me he's suicidal, I forgave him that same night. Fast-forward a month later, and my friend texts me that her date had gone on a date with my boyfriend a week prior to my friend reaching out to me. She described it in detail, enough for me to confirm what I already knew was true. So I confronted him again. This time it all fell apart. His lies, my trust, my vulnerability, my heart, everything. I wanted to throw up. He confessed to sleeping with other people else after I pressed him, and told me how many times. I didn't want to see him ever again. He then opened up about his own sexual trauma and started crying. I cried, too. That night we had sex and in the morning I asked him to take me home. Fast-forward through that month: he says he tried to kill himself, checked himself into the hospital, I freak out and see him, then we fall back into the relationship. It's been over a month and even though I'm still with him, I feel terrible about myself. I'm embarrassed at myself for my codependency. I'm embarrassed about what my friends think of me for continuing in this toxic relationship. I'm embarrassed about what my boyfriend sees in me. I look to others so much to make sense of my identity, him especially. I want to stop being this way so bad. I feel horrible. I'm disgusted more than ever about my body, my personality, my life decisions, everything. I'm losing my sense of self and I'm too embarrassed to tell my therapist how much my identity is linked to feeling sexually desired. How much I still care about what a man thinks about me -- how I rely on his attention for self-validation. (We have not had sex since the night I found out everything; it's been over a month) I know that I'm in a toxic relationship. I am taking the steps to get out of this in spite of my BPD. Although sometimes I feel like I'm letting myself get sucked in, hoping that he'll do something that will make me feel like someone who can be loved. Someone who is loved and cared for. I have so much trauma around abandonment. I listen closely to SZA's song, ""Supermodel,"" the part where she's like: ""I could be your supermodel / If you believe / If you see it in me / See it in me / See it in me / I don't see myself."" And ""Landslide,"" when Stevie Nicks is like: ""I've been afraid of changing because I built my life around you."" My identity has been built around this one person and now, with this betrayal, I realize there was nothing there. When I search for that recognition within me, there's just a gaping hole, because I don't see myself there, either. I want to feel better. I want to love myself and feel desired for just one moment. I know I have a lot of work to do on myself, and I'm so, so lucky to finally have a good therapist after years of searching for someone like her. But it's hard now, every second of every day, when I'm well aware that I am hurting myself by being with this person, when I know I don't need someone to make feel wanted, and when hate myself and sometimes want to die. \~\~ ***tl;dr*** I'm in a toxic relationship with a man who has been cheating on me. My BPD is making it extremely difficult for me to cope with this. I'm confused and feel like I'm in an emotional hole where I look down and just see the distorted perception I have of myself, one that I hate so much. Have you ever had to cope with the emotional aftermath of being cheated on? How did you learn to love yourself again (if you did)? If you're going through this now, I'd love to just hear what it's been like for you. I feel so alone. I'm too embarrassed to open up about this with my friends, even my therapist, because I'm such an obsessively private person. Please don't tell me I \*need\* to leave my partner or get screened for STDs (I'm working on the former and already got tested). I'm just looking for a place to hear from other people with BPD who have dealt with this. &lt;3"

I am a broken man. I need to control my triggers but i cannot because i am addicted to them, it is virtually impossible for me to delete Facebook, Reddit, Instagram. as it is the only communication i get mainly. I am a male with BPD traits (according to psych but i believe i have full blown). When i am exposed to a trigger what happens is my body reacts in total shock, i feel like i cannot believe what i have just been exposed to and immediately rush to the unhealthy coping strategies, these include need for immediate gratification such as thoughts of self harm, suicide. During an episode i find myself feeling intense resentment, anxiety, envy, sadness. These triggers are largely set off by seeing others post a selfie with their partner, and trigger intense feelings of rejection. I feel as if i will die alone, that nobody will love me, and all these negative things. Why this is so hard to deal with is because i also have NPD traits, admitting any form of weakness or vulnerability is sure to threaten my false self and mask of superiority. Where do i get help for this? how will it be treated? many times i miss apoointments because i like procrastination and many times i feel i do not have a problem."

I fell for him hard and became super attached to him. Weve now been dating for quite some time now and I feel like our honeymoon period is over. I feel super overbearing fo him whenever Im perky and cheery and hes just....monotonous. It makes me regret being too cherry because now I feel like a needy annoying girlfriend who overuses pet names. He hasnt done anything wrong or said anything wrong but I miss when he showed me passion. I keep reminiscing over how we used to be in the past and it makes me bitter for the way things are right now. Sometimes I catch myself feeling the need to split on him whenever Im depressed but in the past every time I tried to do that, I just came running back to him. I knew deep down I cant live without him which is why I always come running back. Im in a state of utter pain physically and mentally whenever I split on him and it makes me immediately regret it. I guess in a way the reason I get urges to split on him is because I want him to start missing me and show more affection towards me. Its fucked up so I promised to stop splitting on him. What he doesnt know is that I still get those urges whenever I feel like hes slacking in the relationship. I hate being the way that I am. I hate wanting more and more and feeling unsatisfied. I hate requiring attention to feel loved. I hate feeling paranoid when he doesnt show passion and how it automatically equates in my mind that hes no longer into me. I voiced my concerns to him a few times but now I kind of want to stop ever since I realized this has to do with bpd. Im starting to feel like a crazy girlfriend and that hes better off without me. Im scared his perception of me has changed and now Im too intimidated to show vulnerability. Dont really know the point of this post. Its more of a venting diary since I cant really talk to anyone about this without feeling uncomfortable now :("

I just wanted to share a little positivity. Healthy relationships are possible, we're not doomed. We don't have to be forever alone, we don't have to settle. We can work on ourselves, don't ever give up on yourself. You're worthy of love and you can cultivate happy, healthy relationships. BPD doesn't have to be death sentence. I thought it was and it broke me. First things first, I am not officially diagnosed with BPD (just a little FYI, cause I feel like it's dishonest not to mention that I'm not diagnosed (yet)). However, I am convinced that this is the disorder that explain the way I am. I have weekly appointments with my psychologist and psychiatrist, and I'm sure it's a matter of time before it's ""confirmed"". No, it's not another label I'd like to put on me to make myself feel special. This label would not do me any favours, I'm aware lol. I am just relieved that there's a name that explains why I have always felt and acted so different. I recognise 95% of the symptoms of BPD, I have struggled for years and years with ""who I am"", I never understood why I was so explosive, clingy, zero to 100, terrified of losing close people to the point of me not being able to live life, I worry, I feel extreme anger, I feel extreme happiness, I switch moods 10 times a day etc. The second I found out more about BPD, it felt like I FINALLY understood why I a the way I am. About 100% of all my relationships (friends and family) was toxic. I would make friends, love them so much it hurt me, and then randomly split and cut them out of my life just like that. I did this about 20 times throughout high school. Left me with no friends. I would make new friends, and then split on them cause they let me down on something so irrelevant that now, thinking rationally, disturbs me how I was so... cold and entitled? I would randomly get angry outbursts, hurt people with my words and action and then act like it was all good 10 minutes later. People would get tired of me treating them like a punching bag and be more distant. I made our home situation a living hell sometimes, but I just felt like I was the one that was done wrong. I would feel misunderstood and would blame people for being so sensitive and petty to hold on to things I said when I felt anger/anxiety/sad and didn't know how to deal with it in a normal manner. I started taking antidepressants about 1 year ago, and that did curb my intense emotions with about 30% I'd say. My problems aren't fixed though with just a 30% reduction lol, compared to people with that can regulate their emotions, I still can lose my fucking mind. It's crazy. I'm now 25 years old, and I feel like the older I get, the more I become self-aware and tired of my own shit. I KNOW it's me, that it's not everyone else. I can acknowledge that I'm the one with issues, and all my failed relationships are because of ME. I have always tried, since age 15 I think, to work on myself and be a better, ""nicer"" person but it would never work. I didn't want to date anyone until I got my shit together cause I didn't want to hurt anyone. I didn't want another person to deal with my crazy shit, and I didn't want to feel the pain and anxiety of losing them. I didn't want to feel jealous, scared, hurt if they didn't message me right away. I was scared of being tossed away, and it killing me. It's crazy how this was my greatest fear, even though I did this to so many people. I just didn't want a relationship with someone that would (expectedly) mean the world to me, it seemed like the perfect recipe for disaster. My worst traits would come to surface, I was 100% sure, I wouldn't be able to control it, I was convinceeeeddddd. All that I worked for in my life would be forgotten and the only thing that would be my focus is making sure my significant other was happy, content, still in love, loyal to me 24/7. I wasn't going to sign up for that. After years of being the most distant, hostile and disinterested person in guys because of all this, I don't know what happened, but I just.. one day... I made a move -gotta love BPD random impulsive crazy outbursts, this is so out of character for me lol- and it worked up, cause that guy and I are now dating. It's my very first real relationship. I was terrified in the beginning. I felt so scared. I would ask him constantly after dates if he still liked me, and if he still willing to get to know me. Everything terrified me. If he messaged me 2 minutes later than what I was used to, I'd go full-on psycho and just accept that I was ""too ugly, stupid and irrelevant to be loved."" I thought about breaking up with him many times because I couldn't handle the intense fear of being rejected at any time. Being found less interesting all of a sudden, being found ""not so pretty after all"", or just him realising he can do better. I would randomly cut off contact with him, which hurt him a lot, but I wanted to be in control. It was just all so dysfunctional. My fear of my relationship consuming my life seemed to be become real. I'm guessing this was the first 3 months. We're not even a year in, by the way, so this might come and bite me in the ass (lol always that thought in the back of my mind), but I communicate. I'm self aware. I try to work on myself. The first weeks/months were rough, but we didn't know each other as well and I feel like we had to figure things out. We had multiple discussions, he didnt understand why I was so scared and paranoid. It would upset him, cause he didnt think it was justified as he was giving me no reason for me to think like that. We BPDers know though, its so easy for us to just take any situation and turn it into a worst-case scenario lol. One day I just broke down and told him that this is what I struggle with. That I have many symptoms of BPD, that Im aware of this, that I know its ME, that Im willing to work on it, that I would seek (serious) help (I did, psychologist and psychiatrist, although honestly at this point theyre not doing much for me. No CBT/DBT training yet), and that I respect him and dont ever want to hurt him in this relationship. I told him, he can call me out whenever he feels like Im out of line, he can discuss things with me and that I will try to be as rational and understanding as possible. And that he discuss things he isnt happy with, and that Ill do my best to not take it personally and interpret it as a vicious attack that would be immediately take me to defensive-mode. I told him that sometimes I wont be able to control it. That sometimes I might hurt him with my dysfunctional emotional regulatory skills and shitty coping mechanisms. I told him that I respect him, and that I will try to be as healthy and respectful as possible in my lowest moments, and that I will let him know when Im being a dramatic, unreasonable, angry bitch for no reason by just mentioning beforehand. Quick example: when Im in a BAD mood and I feel hostile and ready to break everything that means something to me, the full-on self-sabotage approach some BPDers know Im sure- Ill just tell him/text him Hey, Im in a bad mood. Nothing to do with you, Im an irrational dramatic mess right now. Its better if I talk to you later. He usually tries to find out more by asking if its something he did, and I let him know either Nope, it has nothing to do with you. I promise. I would tell if it did. No worries okay? Just had a bad day. I need a few hours to cool down, but Ill come around and Ill let you know the second I do okay? Love you, or Yes, Im pissed off because (e.g.) of the comment that you made X hours ago, I dont want to talk about it right now as Im not in a state of mind to have an adult conversation about it. It doesnt mean its the end of the relationship. I dont feel okay about us right now but right now Im not thinking clearly and Im sure if I dont postpone this conversation, this will be a dramatic, elaborate and hurtful conversation as Im not thinking rationally right now. Please lets have this conversation at X, when Im sure Im cooled down. He then usually lets me be) I explained that I can sometimes split, meaning that I can sometimes think of him as the worst person ever and feel like I dont want to ever talk to him again. I pulled that shit in the first weeks and it hurt him so much. I cant hurt him like that, its abuse and he deserves better. I explained to him that I sometimes see things as very black and white, I can be the sweetest, most loving person ever, but when I split, its like the polar opposite. To me, in that moment youre nothing to me anymore. I cant control it. I just feel things really deeply and Im sure Ill feel like that in the future. I just feel nothing when Im hurt or feel abandoned. I explained all of this to him. I told him its something I go through, that I cannot control yet. I told him that Ill try to be as RATIONAL and respectful as possible, as BPD is still no excuse to hurt people with random breakups or hurtful words that I can never take back. I told him its my responsibility to deal with it and try to control it, even though its H A R D for me at that point cause it feels like the MOST JUSTIFIED, INTENSE AND REALLLLLLLLL feeling of being betrayed or abandoned. At that moment, I just feel and its hard for me not to turn into a robot that is ready to seek revenge. Its hard for me not to say the meanest things ever. I have to control every urge to not be the coldest, distant, and heartless bitch. I can make people feel so  useless and replaceable when Im splitting. Saying this, it feels stupid, almost delusional how entitled I (we) can feel sometimes, but the feeling is so fucking real. I told him that if I ever do that again, that he first of all should put in me in my place and tell me that Im splitting and should try to control myself (Im probably very very very aware and doing everything to stop myself, but sometimes hearing it from another person can make me stop ignoring it) and that he should walk away from this relationship. I dont have the right to hurt him and damage him. I told him, that if he wouldnt walk away, I would probably do it cause I am tired of hurting people that dont deserve it. I know its a lot, but after finding out more and more about BPD and people close to pwBPD (romantic/non-romantic relationships), it just fucked up me big time. I knew I had problems and there hasnt been a moment in the last time 10 years that I havent tried to work on it, but its so fucking hard to control yourself when youre feeling everything so deeply. Reading all the posts about people that are friends/dating/married someone with BPD, and their intense hate towards this person, the burninggggggg ambition to leave their BPD-partner in the near future, the deep disgust and hatred they feel due to being treated so poorly was so unbelievably upsetting. I am so glad I am, and the majority of this BPD community, are at least AWARE of how this disorder can affect our behaviour. Self-awareness, and becoming more mature and recognising that its up to ME (!!!!!!!) to handle my disorder, and not for everyone else around me to allow it, and therefore enable it, is what really changed everything for me. I hurt to many people in the past, I just wont fucking do it anymore. I have no right to hurt people although its not intentional to come into lives and leave them with more pain, insecurity and hurt. I am a good person, I just have a disorder that I have to work with and I will. I told my partner all of this, and that he should know that having relationships with BPDer can traumatising, and can leave you with anxiety issues, 0 confidence, PTSD and so on. Its no joke. I told him all of this straight up, I cried, I cried my eyes out for a while on my own. I felt like a monster, even though the last thing I ever want to do is hurt anyone. I told him that he can do his research and decide if he wants to be with me. I told him that the success rate of hapy relationships with BPDers is extremely low (according to Reddit and some other websites lol), and that therapy might never work and I might be a partner. I have been a bad friend before, Ive cut people out and people started cutting me out in a way. I only have one friend that has stuck with me, and I just dont understand why because I put that girl through hell with my shit. Shes the only one that is a non-family member that has been there, even though she shouldnt have because I was a bitch to her so many times. Having no friends, or no good friends is a good indicator of how loyal a person is, and he has many friends he knows since his childhood/young teens. I knew this all could be viewed as a red flag. Its a typical thing for BPDers though, having no tight, stable circle. Like you just randomly become friends with people, best-friends for ever, and then one day its over cause youre bored/hurt by something that wouldve been solved by normal people/annoyed and just cut them off. On to the next one, and so on. I knew that to him, this might have ignited a fear of me doing the same to him. Im not going to lie, its also a legitimate fear as splitting is fucking reckless sometimes, but I invested in this relationship. I am not going to randomly ghost people that I confessed my unconditional love to two days ago. Its disgusting and so evil when I think of it. In 2018 and early 2019, I reunited with friends I randomly abandoned years before (no self-awareness, blaming everyone but myself, entitled as fuck, expecting perfect from everyone and if they didnt meet up my expectations, they were not good to be friends), when talking about our past, they both expressed how hurt they were, how it affected them with new friendships, how they feared being nothing unexpectedly and without warning, how it fucked up their confidence, how it made them question themselves, how many times they cried about daily contact to being blocked of every medium by me and how they were scared that I was going to hurt myself. It gave me a reality check and made me see how extremely inconsiderate, relentless and harsh I can be to people that just DO NOT deserve it. Anyway - I should work on school lol what am I doing lol- ALL of this led me to me being self-aware, and deciding to stop victimising myself in every situation and that even though BPD is HARD to control and deal with sometimes, out of the (intense, deep-rooted) love I feel for people in my life, including my partner now, I chose to work on myself everyday. I keep myself accountable. I do not let myself lose control, and when I do, I inform them that Im having a episode and I need to be alone before doing damage. I told him its not personal, its an issue Im dealing with that will require effort day in day out, but Im willing to work on it. People close to me, including my SO, are allowed to call me out whenever - I asked them to be as objective as possible and not make it into a personal attack if they can. I know its not his job to train me, but the people that chose to stay, are willing to be there for me while Im working on it. When I told my SO that he can walk away if he wants to, that even though it hurt me and the rejection would initially hurt me, I would understand it. I would understand it sincerelyyyyyyy and I wouldnt hold it against him ever, because his well-being is important and should be prioritised. He chose to stay. He knows it wont always be easy and text-book mature and reasonable interactions all the time with me. He tries to understand it, if he doesnt, I make sure he can ask by randomly bringing it up when were comfortable and chatting (by just asking if he wants to ask something/if something he is thinking about/wants know more about). I am so lucky he is as understanding and patient as a man can be. He sees and acknowledges my effort, which means everything to me. He is everything I couldve asked for, hes there for me when Im feeling low, insecure or not good enough. If he isnt happy with something, I encourage him to discuss everything with me and that its my responsibility to listen to him and be there for him. If hes not having issues with my BPD symptoms, he can discuss it with me at all times. I am still stressing this as I do not want him to ever feel like he is walking on egg shells or shut down in fear of hurting me or setting me off. If he feels like that, he should inform me and it will be my job to work on it. We communicate. I am there for him when he needs me, I am thoughtful, I am sweet, I am kind, I challenge him, I support him. He loves me and keeps telling me that Im the sweetest girl he has ever met. Were happy, and even though thats normal in the first year of a relationship, I feel like were in a very healthy relationship. We hold each other accountable, we RESPECT each other, we try to the best for each other, we LISTEN. We never have real fights that turn into name-calling or whatever type of abuse. Were comfortable with each other, we get together weekly and literally do nothing. I feel jealous sometimes but thats an issue I need to work on. Sometimes (like today) I just feel insecure, and Ill just straight up discuss it (X, Im PMSing and feeling insecure and unattractive. I need sweet words cause Im stressing myself out of not being good enough for you. It has nothing to do with you not showing me enough love or appreciation, Im just need another dose of LOVE today!) I dont expect him to read my mind without me telling whats up, I just vocalise it so he can be there for me. **TL;DR** Relationship Im in right now, is the textbook example of healthy relationship to me. I had trouble in the beginning but I ended it before it became a habit to ruin our relationship, his and my confidence and happiness. We communicate, I tell him everything. I hold myself accountable and there are limits I set that I CANNOT cross anymore (even if he tolerates it or not, Im not going to hurt someone because they dont know how to stop it). I WILL NOT let myself cross any boundaries that are considered abuse (anymore). Its my job to control work on myself. I let him know in the beginning about me struggling with BPD (symptoms). I explained everything and gave him the option to think about it. He is allowed to stand up for himself, call me out and ask questions whenever he feels like it. If he feels disrespected, silenced, or the idea that he has to change himself to make me happy, he can ALWAYS notify me. I will always try to be the best version of myself and try communicate maturely, and de-escalate situations/conversations by delaying them for another time when Im more level-headed and reasonable. I also wont stop seeing my psychologist and psychiatrists until I enrolled in a CBT/DBT training, and will try to work out if medications are needed in the future or not. I also will always keep reading self-help books concerning BPD/communication/relationship skills to be the best version of myself, for myself and him."

My BPD and eagerness to please means I know how to be everything they've ever wanted. I also know how to come across as just available enough but not too needy at first. I can be exciting and different and my lack of impulse control definitely ramps up the excitement. In the beginning of the relationship I'm highly sexual. But once we really know each other I become frustrated that whilst I'm becoming their dream girl, they aren't doing the same for me. And every time they do something that displeases me I feel rejected and terrified they're going to leave me. I distance myself, swinging between super needy and demanding, and really cold. If they are emotionally unavailable I want them more because of the fear of abandonment and I want to change them to love me. But if they're emotionally available and love me despite my issues, and don't argue then I become terrified that I'm going to be engulfed by them. The intimacy and real vulnerability is awful and I become distant and absolutely cannot stand being touched or loved or any sexual contact whatsoever and I end it. I **need** the push and pull. I **need** the drama. I have such a messed up relationship with sex and love that I cannot fathom ever having a normal relationship. I also swing between fully gay and bisexual. I have no clue what I am, who I am, what I want etc. And it's so fucking tiring."

I know the truth now. And I'm so fucking tired of pretending this was a normal relationship and I'm just going through a break up. I feel so alone. My ex is a master at covering his true self, nobody would believe me if I said it. And I'm afraid of him. I want peace from him finally. I wouldn't tell mutual friends. My mum knows and one of my friends know, but the people on the edge of my circle don't know. I have considered telling them but I fear the vulnerability, even though I'm not asking for support, just to be heard! Not to be pitied, or shamed for staying so long, but argh, is it possible to just be acknowledged as a survivor of a controlling cruel abusive man who broke my heart on so many occasions it's countless? What do you think? Can I be more open about this?"

79,vulnerability,BPD,bpd; sudden repulsion syndrome; splitting? (repost from r/off my chest),6,ccf09j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ccf09j/bpd_sudden_repulsion_syndrome_splitting_repost/,2019-07-13 04:55:27,"For as long as I've had friends, I've struggled in finding the right approach to relationships. Since I was young, I have had a problem with ""hating"" people, at (seemingly) random, and for no logical reason. I have hurt many people because of it, and have had trouble figuring out what it even is. Only very recently have I found an actual name for something not quite, but similar to what I've felt- sudden repulsion syndrome. It usually goes something like: I really like someone! They make me so happy! I get really close with them and we're attached at the hip. I spend much of my time thinking about them and they soon become my favorite person/best friend/the most significant person in my life. Everything's Great. and then- I don't even know when this happens- I start to look down on them. I see them and get annoyed. Their face, their voice, their movements, *everything* about them begins to seem increasingly dumb, and annoying, and ridiculous, and no matter what they do, I want nothing more than to get away from them. It is **intense**. Eventually, they get the message, and- after messaging me asking what they did wrong, or getting upset because they don't deserve to be treated the way I'm treating them- they give up trying to figure it out, and leave me alone. *Good,* I think. But then, some months later, I look at them, and feel a weight lifted off my chest. The contempt and disgust that I felt whenever I so much as glanced in their direction (or vice versa), has, literally, evaporated. It feels like those scenes in movies when a character has been freed from brainwashing (see: Toothless after Stoick's death in How to Train Your Dragon 2). It feels like a cloud has been lifted from my eyes and my heart, and I feel affection for them once again. I feel a hint of guilt at my own acknowledgement of what I've put them through- hating them for no reason and not explaining myself; leaving them confused and hurt for what seems like an eternity before I suddenly ""feel better"". Up until 2017, I continued this pattern without ever truly and explicitly acknowledging my actions and the hurt that I caused so many friends. In 2017, I realized, ""oh, that's not right at all"", and ""what's wrong with me?"", and, most importantly, ""*why?*"". The hurt that I've put my friends through (off the top of my head I can count 8 friends who I've put through this) is cruel, and has no logic behind it. They have always been the same person, the same human being with gifts and flaws and quirks, like every other person has. It was not them who changed, but me. My ""hate thing"" doesn't happen because of an argument, or a quality that I truly deem unacceptable. It doesn't happen because they did anything to me, or because my values changed. There is absolutely, without a doubt, no reason whatsoever for this change in feeling towards people. I have hated this part of me since I realized it was me, and not them. I have been confused and overwhelmed by my completely unnecessary cruelty, and have struggled to answer questions about it. I think, however, that I've found a pattern. I normally put them on a pedestal. I view them as a person higher than me, and it feels like having a ""crush"". Only later on do I notice certain things about them that put me off, or make me frown in judgement. This sounds a lot like falling out of the ""honeymoon phase"", but seems to be pretty extreme. Another thing that I've noticed is that my hate thing seems to be triggered when the other person shows me that they are, actually, human. It's triggered when they are no longer on that pedestal, and show me vulnerability in them. I guess that makes me all the more cruel for taking that vulnerability and judging it, walking away from it. I still struggle with it. I don't know exactly how to deal with it, how to approach it when it happens, or how to avoid it altogether. I really don't know. It's hard. It's hard to see my friends hurting so damn much because of some weird switch in my brain that's flicked on and off whenever it pleases. It's freaking hard to be the cause of so much confusion and pain, and to *not know* ***how to fix it***. I want it to never happen again. But I'm afraid, because I don't know how to stop it either. I thought I would share this because there is not a lot of content about this on the internet. Or- I've never heard anyone experience anything even remotely similar to what I'm describing. Today while I was searching the web, I saw lots of ""my best friend hates me for no reason and I don't know what to do"" posts on sites like quora and yahoo answers. A lot of the answers said that ""they're not worth it if they hate you, forget about them"" and ""they're not your friend, then"" and ""maybe you did something to them that made them angry?"". I, of course, don't know what the answer really is. However, I want it to be known that in my case- you have done nothing wrong, you are still the amazing person that I know you to be. I'm aware of the effect that this can have on you, and you absolutely don't deserve it! You deserve someone who sees you for you, and you deserve to be treated right. I know this. I also want it to be known that I'm not heartless. I'm really not. I think there is a psychological pattern and reason for my behaviors and attitude towards those who are at the receiving end of my hate thing. I just don't really know what it is yet. And I want it to be known that I'm sorry. I'm sorry for anyone that has to feel that confusion and hurt, and I hope you know you deserve only the best, but also that you keep in mind- I'm confused, too. To anyone that's actually read this, thanks for taking the time to read! I hope that it might help some people who might be struggling with similar issues? and I hope that all of you know that you're great! and you deserve to know that you are awesome. (a note: I put BPD in the title because I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, so I thought that might be an important factor. I'm just not sure how, haha..)"

I've been told by my friends that I am empathetic to a fault. but really am I? I'm just good at reading people, like narcs do. all of my good qualities can be twisted into something a narcissist would be good at. i dated a narcissist and we had a lot in common, i wasn't sadistic tho. but i have an ego for sure. when i'm sitting in class I have thoughts that i'm smarter than everyone else in the room. i know my teachers can tell i'm defiant toward authority so they don't like me, they think i'm arrogant. the biggest thing is therapy is hard for me because I think I know better than the therapist and sometimes in sessions I end up ""therapizing"" myself out loud. then my therapist says something i've already considered about a thousand times. this isn't just a one off, it happens a lot and with numerous therapists. (4) i feel as though i need to prove myself to everyone i come into contact with, and if i feel unsatisfied like i didn't measure up to their standards I get real angry. first outwardly then inwardly. i've become just feeling inwardly incredibly incredibly cynical and hateful. i find it hard to be around anyone because I'm so filled with contempt toward them. **the ""twist"" is, or it's completely the other way around.** i feel inferior to every person i come into contact with. i look at them and i wish deep down i could be as carefree as them. i'm truly miserable most of the time. and i know it's because i feel like a doomed sore on society and that no one not a soul loves me. to escape this vulnerability i just intellectualize everything to the point of apathy and it only makes me more cynical. i hate authority but at the same time if i could just get one of my professors to like me i'd sing. to me this reads like i'm a narcissist, or narc traits at least. i want to kill my ego basically and love outwardly and make other people feel better instead of constantly thinking about myself. thanks for reading."

I just got woken up to my son and his GF arguing and he is yelling and screaming and when my husband and I try to get involved he tells us to Fuck off or Stay out of this. He then yelled at me to tell my husband to leave them alone and so I did and then tried to calmly talk to my son as he was freaking out because his GF was leaving for work and he was trying to stop her because he wasnt finished with the argument and was angry at her for trying to leave. Told me to fuck off and that it doesnt involve me. He is 17 and has so far refused to get help. He gets mad and tells all of us that WE are crazy. Meanwhile all of us are in some sort of counselling and he is the only one who is not. He says very cruel and hurtful things and slams the doors so hard, the whole apartment reverberates. He doesnt get physical but its getting close. He bullies all of us and screams at us and tells us we are crazy or stupid. I try to tell him to get out until he calms down or that he doesnt have the right to cause so much disruption in the household. He gets even angrier and turns it on me saying that Im doing it to him. Im going crazy and also recovering from a major surgery so I am emotionally empty. When I tell him to get out he accuses me of kicking him out which is not true. I bend over backwards to be accommodating and understanding and have learned about BPD as much as I can but nothing seems to work And only seems to make him angrier. He then basically tells us all to fuck off and that hes not leaving his room and for us to leave him alone. And that he doesnt have to do anything we tell him to do. He says he doesnt care that hes making too much noise and doesnt care about how we are feeling. He makes it sound like what he is doing is normal and he has every right to lash out at everyone just because he isnt getting his way (wanted GF to stay and keep arguing). He gets mad at me for reacting or crying and being sad and triggered by my childhood abuse. My dad was the same but he was an alcoholic and would turn on you in a heartbeat and go from being chill and joking to being raging and abusive. One second youre laughing and literally the next youre getting hit and the rage would go on and on for hours until he left. Then he would leave and come back hours later like nothing happened. Leaving a house of kids and his wife sobbing and hurting and bleeding. My son does the same except for the physical abuse. He NEVER apologizes and retreats into his room or runs away for a few hours and then appears again and starts talking to me/us like nothing ever happened. Its hurtful and leaves you thinking that he just doesnt care. When hes not like this he is the most loving, kind, helpful, generous person who I love and like very much. Ive always been supportive and have been trying to figure out whats wrong and how to handle it better for years. I need to know what to do because I cant live this way anymore. It hasnt happened in weeks and just when you think maybe it wont happen again, he explodes irrationally and doesnt allow any of us to have our emotions because his is the only one thats right. We are all liars and crazy and hell scream in our faces and get into our personal space and wont let people leave and refuses to leave when asked. It an impossible circle and it leaves a wake of destruction in its path. Ive had to call the police once before due to his raging. We live in an apartment and have gotten several complaints from neighbours. This is truly becoming a threat to our residency but he doesnt care when hes angry. Its all about his feelings and feeling persecuted and that no one is on his side and we all are crazy for reacting to his rage and insults and the way he thinks he can do whatever he wants and we have to let him act that way just because he is feeling a certain way. I KNOW this is not his fault when it happens and I try so hard but the only way he calms down is if you agree with him that hes right. When he is Absolutely not right and is out of control and bullying everyone. I never get an apology and Im tired of being forced to condone his behaviour. Please help. Right now I dont really care to see or speak to him for the rest of the day. I CANT leave due to my recovery from surgery. This is the second time since Ive been home from the hospital that a huge argument has happened. The first time I was able to let Him talk it out but he was loud and angry for a couple of hours before he eventually calmed down. But he still ended up thinking he fight was all his GFs fault. It gaslighting and makes you so confused that you seriously begin to question your own sanity and he will deny what he said and did even though it literally just happened and persists so that you end up feeling like YOU ARE the problem. Im just sobbing and my heart is breaking. Help me. Help me to help him. Im backed in a corner with nowhere to turn."

My friend group (12-15 people) all use drugs regularly at parties, and our BPD friend has been participating equally, but we are worried about his suicidal ideation and self-harm tendencies-- many times he has adverse reactions to drugs and ends up locking himself in bathrooms, self-harming, falling asleep in a full bathtub, etc. We all want to intervene and tell him that we cannot enable his behaviour anymore because we think he is a danger to himself when he is high. But also, we don't know how to tell him in the right way without him feeling paranoid, insecure, defensive, or resistant. We are currently thinking of having 4-5 friends hold an intervention-esque meeting where we voice our concerns and set out some boundaries regarding drug use/abuse within the group, specifically emphasizing his vulnerability. Yet we don't know what we are doing, and want some advice going in. All we want is for him to be safe and healthy. He is seeing a therapist, he has been through DBT.

One of the most prominent and debilitating symptoms of my BPD is having panic attacks and being unable to control overwhelming emotions (that Im completely unable to hide because it always results in crying) while on the clock. This has always been a problem in every work environment Ive been in. Currently Im working as a hairstylist and I love what I do more than anything Ive done in the past, but working with the public has its challenges. Ive been at my current place of employment for just over two months, and the other day I had my first full blown panic attack on the job, Im talking hyperventilating, hysterical, nonstop tears. I had to clock out for a full hour. What doesnt help is I currently have no health insurance so therapy and DBT arent an option for me Coming into work the next day my manager pulled me aside. She told me that shes cutting my hours by one day a week and that it cant happen again and that it was completely unprofessional and that she is at her wits end with me. I have many mixed feelings about this conversation I had with her, but am I wrong to feel like Im being punished for something thats essentially a disability? If I could help having a panic attack on the clock, It would never happen. People treat it as though its something I have a choice in and i wish I could just explain that Im doing the best I can. Im terrified of the repercussions if I happen to have another one, and Im terrified that its inevitable that itll happen again since I have no access to therapy, DBT, or medication, and she knows this. She cant fire me, but she can cut my hours even more than she already has and I need this job and the money I make from it to survive. The fact that I now feel more on edge from this than I ever have is only increasing my vulnerability to have another one. One of the main things that depresses me and pushes me to suicidal thoughts and behaviors is feeling like I have no place in this world. When I was hired by a different manager and first starting, that feeling wasnt prominent at all, I really felt like I found that sense of belonging. Now that shes told me how unprofessional Im being and essentially a burden Ive been on her, that feeling of not having a place in the world is coming to the forefront and that scares me so much. So heres what Ive come to ask: How do you handle intense emotions on the job? How do your superiors approach the situation when it happens? Is there any way I can approach my manager about this conversation we had, since Im not getting a good feeling from it at all? Is there anything I can say to help her sympathize or understand where Im coming from, but maintain professionalism? The conversation we had is not sitting well with me at all. Did my manager approach me in an ethical way or am I right in thinking it crossed a line? Are any of you guys on government assistance from to being unable to work due to BPD or symptoms related to BPD? If all else truly fails, can I rely on government assistance to get by, since this is something that Im having such a hard time managing on my own? Thank you for your feedback"

I have no idea if this is the right place to post this. Ive been reading through some of these posts and I am blown away by the courage and clarity, vulnerability and pain that Im seeing. But the thing that is resonating, as I suspected it would, is that Im almost positive that my sister has BPD. She has been struggling with depression and anxiety for almost 10 years, in and out of abusive and unstable relationships, shes been fired from 3 different jobs, all for being unprofessional  shes a hilarious and zany person. Shes funny and unpredictable and incredibly smart so there were times when she would be, in my words, used as a prop at a work function, to be the life of the party. When it got down to business they would call her unhinged behind her back. I think the cycle of these work and personal/romantic relationships became ingrained in her personality. She would come home and fall into a deep depression when no one found her funny enough to laugh or love her enough. She does tell me often that she is tired of living and wants to die and weve had one episode of self-harm. Because her job situation has never been stable, she has also accumulated a lot of debt and continues to spend impulsively. Her apartment has an entire bedroom full of clothes with tags still attached. But every 3 months her electric bill is shut off. She just recently within the last 4 months has had a job in retail (which she hates and believes that because she is unable to control her complaints to her colleagues, she believes she will be fired from this job as well.) but she currently has insurance, but only just recently. Getting her to agree to see doctors, especially mental health professionals is next to impossible but Ive begged her to find someone to talk to. I hurt for her. Ive cared for her our whole lives, as my parents took very little interest in us as children, though we were raised in a loving home. But she relies on me for everything. Her episodes have become more of a daily thing and theyve become strange. Ive noticed that she has absolutely no joy or expression on her face when she reacts. I think of it as a line graph. Shes flat until she dips and within 5 minutes shes bawling. And she does not show sadness for other people. Nor does she smile when she greets them or when someone says something funny. Its important to me to love her completely and to help her but with boundaries for me and my husband and son. In researching how to do this, it has led me to believe she has BPD. But she often has a lot of anger, resentment and envy directed at me, as well as EXTREME neediness and need for approval, I dont know how to help her receive the proper diagnosis and care she needs. I just want to help her and love her. People tell me all the time that she has to want to help herself but I dont think she knows how to do that and Im scared for her. Any resources or advice from you who struggle with this would be so appreciated. Maybe there are those on this thread who have been in her shoes and you can help me understand whats the best way to show her love. I ask her a lot what I can do for her or is there anything she needs and often her response is You cant do anything for me because you dont understand because you have everything. BPD is not on her radar at all and I dont believe I am the one who can tell her about it. Any words that come out of my mouth are hyper-analyzed and she would consider it a judgement that I am passing rather than something for her to look into. She will see a therapist for depression because she acknowledges that she struggles with that. But is there anything that can be said or done, BY ANYONE, to look at the BPD factors? (Also knowing that she is often compelled to downplay her issues or flat out lie to doctors to hide the the uncomfortable truths.) Thank you and bless you."

We've hung out about 8 times since the beginning of June and he seems to genuinely like me. I'm really reluctant to open myself up to people but I've been pretty much myself with him and haven't needed to hold back much. I've worked a lot on managing the impulsivity and mood parts of BPD, but I still struggle A LOT with relationships, particularly ones that start becoming romantic. He told me last week that he hasn't even met anyone else. After he said that, my fears of vulnerability pretty much disappeared because I really thought that this had potential to blossom into something serious. However, today I went back on Tinder to see what was new and noticed that he updated his profile within the last week. We have been hanging out a bit less but he has been pretty busy (for what I believe are legit reasons) this week. My schedule is a lot more open than his so he knows that I can make time for him. But it feels like sometimes he says we'll hang out (particularly on the weekends), but we never do. And he doesn't text me either. He said he's going to stay home and work today instead of doing what he planned to do (and I was supposed to tag along; when he asked me to tag along, we were also supposed to hang out on Sunday) and now is saying that *""maybe""* we can hang out Sunday instead of him being free. I'm starting to panic. I've been ruminating about this for like three hours now. I don't know what to do. Do I bring it up? Is it too early to ask if this has potential to develop into something serious? I don't want to come on full strength because I recognize that this is unhealthy thinking and thought patterns.

Borderline, of course. Narcissistic, hypersexual, emotionally anorexic, and a fear of abandonment that is so strong, it'll probably never get better. I doubt I will ever be in a true loving relationship. I purposely seek out those who are unavailable. 5 month flings. That's always what it is. I give all my love, my nurture, my help, and people please like crazy to keep someone around. But you text me 2 times in a day? Oh no, that's a little too clingy for me. Goodbye. I've used every excuse in the book: I love being single! I'm married to my work right now! I'm trying to find myself! I just haven't met the right person yet! But none of them are true. The truth is that I'm too scared to get close to someone because once they see any vulnerability from me, it's over. So it's better to leave before they do. I had a counsellor I told this too and I can't go back to her anymore. I told her too much. She must think I'm crazy."

I think my therapist thinks Im over dramatic and dumb, making constant excuses why I wont just do the right thing or make the right choices. Im truly at a loss and just wondering if anyone else feels the same, what youve done to combat it. I choose the wrong people to give my attention to, to love, I choose the wrong things to eat, the wrong activities to engage in... none of it is serving me in any way and just making my life harder than it has to be, but they are fundamentally things I just want because I guess I dont care about myself.

I have an acute awareness that stuff is there but I get a visceral feeling of disgust when I catch a glimpse of my own vulnerability. I look at my own pain the way I look at shit on my shoe, and I think that knee jerk reaction exists to protect me- *you don't get love from being a weak crying baby, dumbass. No one will love you if you feel bad, snap out of it and make people laugh*. It's a message I've deeply internalized from my childhood that has caused me to unconciously treat myself the way my abusers have, then project and blame feeling unloved onto people who actually love me now. At my most honest, most vulnerable, all I want is people to love me. When they do, I get so uncomfortable I want to jump out of my skin because then it's apparent this problem is mine. I'm no longer being abused, I'm no longer being victimized, I'm no longer a helpless child, but a part of my psyche is frozen in time. I feel like a ghost in a residual haunting, walking through walls because they used to be the only pathways I travelled down. I'm extremely grateful for the people I have in my life. It was my birthday yesterday and I received so much love that I didn't know what to do with. I felt separated from everyone by a glass pane, like I was incapable of truly connecting or feeling the warmth everyone giving me. I could see there was a beautiful world right in front of me but I couldn't figure out how to break the damn window. Every act and word of tenderness made me cry because something deep inside of me won't allow me to feel that it's true. How could anyone love me? I'm nothing. I'm garbage. I'm ugly and have a stupid voice. I'm annoying and embarrassing and fucking crazy. I'm better off dead. If everyone forgot about my birthday, my paradigm wouldn't have been shaken as much as it was. I would've felt victimized, angry, but not surprised. *I'm a piece of shit and nobody loves me. I don't deserve love.* I would've gotten to rationalize picking a fight or getting high to feel better. With a target to hate, I wouldn't have had to face my own permeating self hatred that is the root of every single decision I make, which is a pain so deep my entire psyche has constructed itself in a way to help me avoid it. Its my biggest blind spot. Now that I'm here, vulnerable and truly feeling it, how can I heal it? I want to be a real person, not a conglomeration of ineffective, self destructive coping mechanisms."

It's been a hard year for me in this relationship, I blocked her on everything last night as well. She knows very well the emotional problems and attachment problems I'm stuck with and she just kind of did it anyway. She actually cheated on me once too and I felt like I was dying but I got over it because I loved her so much. I put my life on hold and supported her through 3 years of university because I loved her. I met her in 2 different countries when she was on exchange, one of those countries I went to twice. I can feel the big split now, because I actually don't remember what that felt like. Compounded by her not actually talking to me for the month of february which left an unresolvable distance between us in my heart even when we were together again, I can now only think of everything I didn't like about her.

She was only 35, though she had quite complex health problems. She isn't suffering anymore. I feel as if my grief response has switched off, though. I know grieving, I've lost many people who I loved and felt fucking destroyed for a very long time. But with the past two losses (this aunt and a woman who was a second mother to me), I haven't been able to do much more than cry for 5 minutes when I found out, and then nothing. &amp;#x200B; Though this time, when I think about her, I drift to her funeral. At her funeral will be her sister, and brother. Her sister is my biological mother, and her brother is my uncle. Both of these people caused a lot of suffering and pain for me. And I have a panic attack. And then I weep, because I know I can't return to my hometown, to that funeral home I grieved so many others at. I can't see those people. I can't just ""pop in"", as it's a 5 hour drive away, and wouldn't be able to leave immediately. I'd be forced to spend the weekend at the birth giver's home, I'd have to see birth giver on Mother's day, and the idea of giving her any kind of ""Motherly Respect"" makes me fucking sick. She is a huge reason as to why I am the way I am. She's the reason I am too scared to ask for favours or help, because I'm terrified everyone is motivated to use my vulnerability against me. Her bullying and gaslighting has written a hard to change narrative for my self esteem, and I feel disgusting when I think of her. Her brother would act as ""mediator"", and by this I mean he would join in on berating me and tell me why I deserved birth giver's treatment. These two people made me far too dependent on them, while simultaneously chastising me for not being able to support myself. &amp;#x200B; And i think of him. The boy I once loved that cut his life short with a noose, who decided to take the phrase ""at the end of my rope"" literally and who ruined so many of us with grief. His funeral was the hardest to go to at that place. I fell down when I saw him in that casket, and I didn't feel anything but a longing to join him, for years afterwards. That town holds so many bad memories and so much trauma, that I just can't ever go back. &amp;#x200B; I'm sorry, my lovely, hilarious, wonderful Aunt. I just can't go to your funeral"

In the aftermath of my most recent breakup, I seriously began questioning my tendencies and the reoccurring patterns I would exhibit in romantic engagements. Right now I fluctuate between wondering if I am a mild-moderate case of true BPD, or if I am just a severely codependent person stuck in Karpman's Drama Triangle (I found this article to be very impactful, to the point where I started crying because of how clearly I could see myself in these scenarios: [URL &amp;#x200B; For context- I began taking antidepressants a month ago and started CBT, the first medication and form of therapy I've ever been exposed to in my entire life. Nothing beyond the initial appointment where I discussed recent traumatic events and my reliance on others for happiness, to which my therapist concluded the session by explicitly saying I didn't meet the criteria for borderline or bipolar (had to rule that one out because of family history). &amp;#x200B; I want to make it clear that I am *not* looking for a diagnosis. What I'm searching for is input and observations on something I wrote to a former significant other, prior to us actually getting together. At the time of writing it- a solid year ago now- I saw nothing wrong with what I was saying. Even now I struggle to make a decisive conclusion as to whether the ideas I am endorsing are fundamentally unhealthy. And as reluctant as I am to admit it, I'm fairly certain that I still retain the majority of the beliefs and self-narratives mentioned, which might go on to explain the falling out I had with my most recent partner. &amp;#x200B; Any thoughts or comments would be greatly appreciated. &amp;#x200B; &gt;""I find myself inexplicably drawn towards you. Even if I know staying up late just to see you/talk to you or having a drink with you on a weekday isnt the most logically sound action to take, I am compelled to do it anyway because I just want to be around you. Okay? Im sorry if I came off too strong, I wasnt trying to make you uncomfortable. But I dont know how else to express this in a way that downplays the intensity but sufficiently portrays the significance &amp; my excitement at the same time. &gt; &gt;I suppose that's really all I was trying to say yesterday. As I said on the phone, its not that I want to elope with you, nor do I think Im falling in love or anything. I just know I really like you and want to explore whatever it is thats going on. Youre making me feel things I didnt expect to feel. Things that I dont know if I really \*want\* to feel because I recognize how big my heart is in relationships. Im fucking scared of it myself, and afraid of how far I know it can go. &gt; &gt;I know for a fact that I like you for things that are unique to you. You possess qualities that, in my eyes, distinguish you from the rest of the crowd and they make me want to drench myself in the energy you exude, the atmosphere you create. &gt; &gt;Im very particular with romantic pursuits. I dont do this dating thing and I dont play games. I have to be selective with who I invest in; I HAVE to be serious, honest, explicit, and uncomfortably straightforward because I know not everyone wants or appreciates mein my full force (or something to that effect). This is the ultimate heartbreak for me- being shamelessly, fearlessly, and unabashedly myself and it being too much for others. Intensity and passion permeates all (most) areas of my life- my brother is the same way and he describes it as us simply having a tremendous capacity to feel and to love. Its a great virtue but its definitely one of our biggest pitfalls as it creates a fatal vulnerability. He and I fuck it up even more by trying to counteract this (or cover it up???) with our ability to analyze and rationalize things to death. its like a crazy combination of 100% heart and 100% mind. I cant change this and honestly, I dont believe I should have to. Despite having moments of debilitating insecurity &amp; self-hatred, Im realizing more and more every day that I should stop blaming myself for not receiving the type of love and acceptance that I deserve. &gt; &gt;So with partners, its all or nothing. I dislike viewing it in black-and-white terms but I need to be able to either give my all or give absolutely NOTHING. It makes no sense to me to withhold the things I have to offer from those Im willingly giving myself to. But I am aware that I cant always do this and will face an incredible amount of pain upon realizing that whoever it may be doesnt want all of me, or is unable to reciprocate it and give me all of them. My most recent boyfriend of 3 years was like that. Going through that process has been the most excruciating pain Ive ever experienced in my life. &gt; &gt;It sucks that I cant tell if you like me for me or because of the company I provide. Like Im filling a void or something, a temporary placeholder that you acknowledge but dont necessarily.appreciate entirely. Funny enough, I thought to myself last night that I dont care how much you may hurt me. If getting hurt by you is what it takes to be able to know you, be close to you, spend time with you then Im okay with that for now. I think youre worth the pain."""
96,vulnerability,BPD,"Growing up, were your emotions invalidated?",66,b1lwr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/b1lwr9/growing_up_were_your_emotions_invalidated/,2019-03-16 10:44:12,"I just pulled up a book I had on DBT for BPD in response to a message on here. Looking through it I find the theory it talks about on the invalidating environment in the development of BPD to be extremely accurate for my experience at least. My family are incapable of empathy for reasons including psychological issues and alcohol abuse. And anytime I try to talk to them about struggles I'm going through, they tell me the worst advice, side with the other person, tell me I am overreacting, etc. Recently I was sexually assaulted and my family told me I was exaggerating, that it was all my fault, I should get over it, etc. It's so ridiculous, but for a long time I thought that I was the problem. It's been so helpful to realize I am better off without these people who caused me to have issues. If anyone is interested, this is what I am referring to in the book: ""The role of invalidation in the development of emotion dysregulation makes a lot of sense, once you realize that a primary function of emotions in humans (as well as other mammals) is to serve as a rapid communication system. Invalidation of emotions sends the message that the communication was not received. When the message is important, the sender understandably escalates the communication by escalating the emotion. When the receiver does not get the communication or disbelieves it, he or she understandably increases efforts to stop the communication, usually by some means of invalidation."" ""In theory, a child with low biological vulnerability may be at risk for BPD and/or high emotion dysregulation if there is an extreme discrepancy between child and caregiver characteristics, or if the familys resources are extremely taxed (e.g., by a family members alcoholism or a sibling with can- cer). Such situations have the potential to perpetuate invalidation, because the demands of the child often exceed the ability of the environment to meet those demands."" Source: [URL"

Most of the time my friendships are built out of proximity and necessity. If the semester is over and we dont share classes anymore, the friendship is basically gone. It might just be because I dont put enough effort in building the relationship, but it goes both ways too, right? I try and ask them to hang out, but theyre always busy or outright ghost me, which is really discouraging. It might be my fear of vulnerability and/or trust issues, making it hard to form an emotional connection to that person because we never talk about anything deep or serious, only casual stuff like hobbies. Im thankful for the few great friendships I have, but I met them all in high school, which was 5 years ago already. The one person I felt close to in college, we barely talk anymore because were always busy. All this makes me insecure/jealous of my FP whos this amazing social butterfly who easily makes connections with people. I asked him for advice and he told me to basically jump in and get to know the person one-on-one. Which, given my trust issues and mild social anxiety on top, makes it more difficult.

This is going to be lengthy, but I encourage you to read it because I think that you may feel more hope for yourself at the end, though I will make it as straightforward as I am able. Im 25 now and Ive gotten much better at managing my (therapist-suspected) quiet BPD. I was never officially diagnosed, but I think there is a reason for that; I tend to cling on to whatever definition of self that Im given and she (my therapist) is very dismissive of labels. Which is why it kind of shocked me when she proceeded to do so at our appointment last week: What it comes down to is what is right for you, regardless of labels or what he may have. - This was her on the subject of my current boyfriend, whom she casually asked if he is a narcissist. This one threw me for a loop. I had considered it before and pretty much dismissed it, as he is not so blatantly evil as I find in many of the descriptors and second-hand accounts. Plus, Ive grown to become terrified of my black and white thinking, so I am always very hesitant to see someone else as the bad guy. Ive done my fair share of harm in the past. Therefore, Ive grown accustomed to always questioning myself and my feelings before reacting outwardly. Inwardly is another story, however, which leads me to the subject of my eating disorder. I have struggled with letting go of being the dainty, scrawny child for years. My grandparents teasing me about how light I was inspired me to feel cute and lovable, and when they subsequently turned around and lamented how my cousin couldnt stop gaining weight, I knew that I could never allow that to happen to me. This connection that Id made, coupled with the deprivation that is innate with being raised a health-conscious, vegetarian child, lead to my binging in junior high, eventual restriction in adulthood, and an ongoing battle with bulimia - and let me tell you it got messy. Im talking, my apartment had bugs, you couldnt see the floor, it smelled like puke, the bathroom was a disaster. Staying clean has always been a struggle for me, but bulimia thrives on the chaos. Now, there was a point before it got that bad, minus the bugs I suppose, that one of my best friends insisted upon coming over to pee. It was after a night a drinking and fun with friends, and though I kept saying I couldnt, that he didnt understand, that it was too messy in there, he insisted and I just gave up. My thoughts at the time were, well, might as well lose him as a friend now, its not like you deserve him anyway. I think I wanted to see the disgust mirrored in his face, a confirmation that nobody other than family (who doesnt have a choice in the matter, due to chemicals and biology) could ever love me through that. This friend was there during the 2nd and last time I had the courage to end my current relationship. He was going through a difficult breakup as well. We slept together once and once I found out that I didnt have a chance with him, I opened up to him like Ive never opened up before to anyone. I told him about my disorders, my struggles, my therapy, you name it. Each time expecting him to toddle his ass on out - yet he never did. Still, everyone has a breaking point, so when I let him into my apartment, I knew all bets were off. Except they werent. He stayed and talked to me and ever since that moment a little over a year ago, I began to allow myself to hope/to think that if he can accept the shittiest and most embarrassing parts of me, why cant my significant other? It would be one thing if I werent actively trying to fix myself and accepting my fall into addiction and self-hatred - but Im not. Hes seen a pile of clothes on the floor and been absolutely disgusted by it. How do you let it get this way? I dont understand. I dont understand either, but Im working on it, I say. Its never going to change; Ive just given up. Juxtapose that next to my friends response? I just...I deserve better. So if you ever feel like a mess and that nobody will ever love you, think about a girl with a fucking disgusting apartment, her inward mess showing outwardly in an honest-to-god appalling manner and how someone loved her regardless. And get this - thanks to my asshole therapist (I say this in a begrudgingly, loving manner), Ive realized Im in love with my friend (something I did not want to acknowledge for fear of exposing my my vulnerability) and yet, Im able to want him to be happy more so than I want his attention. And this is during a time where Ive craved attention more than ever before due to the lack of (positive) attention that Im currently receiving. Do you know how amazing that is? Ive been able to encourage him to get out there and feel better, to date, to be him, without forcing myself into the picture. A mature love, my therapist calls it...its so strange. At any rate, that marks the end of the encouraging message, and now I enter into the need for support. I have been avoiding breaking up with my SO because the last time that I did (three years ago) the things he said and did were so hurtful; so hurtful that I never want to feel that way again. Ive been stuck for so many years now, that the fear of remaining here is finally beginning to counter the fear of him telling me every negative thing that Ive ever thought about myself. I dont want to wait anymore. I want to rip the bandaid off for good and never go back. I want to find someone who loves me for who I am, I want to have permission to love me for who I am. But I freeze at the thought of picking up the phone. Can you help me with confronting this situation head-on? Thank you for taking the time to read and thank you for this sub."

I think a number of you would be able to relate. Stage 1: I'm not alone! You finally have a name for why you are the way you are. You meet other people that you can talk to about ANYTHING. You find this Reddit and finally, *finally* feel less alone. Stage 2: Alienation If you decided to go public with the diagnosis, you will find that many people don't understand what it is, nor do they care. Most people will say something like ""You're bipolar, right?"" And you will find yourself at a disadvantage in heated arguments because people can fall back on the ""You're crazy."" card. You may find yourself being subservient to others during this period of vulnerability because people can be quite cruel when they sense weakness. Humans will start looking like a flock of geese that pick off the goose with the broken feather. 3. Productivity/Loss of Identity Herding yourself back to the space of acceptance, you'll find yourself posting things like ""Does anyone else (insert behavior here)"" to feel less alone. It's invigorating. Validating. You know what's wrong with you and you have a plan to change it. You join DBT. You conform. You work. You change. But on the flip side, you can't figure out what is you and what is the disorder. 4. Bad Psychiatric Experience Some of you didn't have this and won't. I came into contact with psychiatrists that told me that I didn't actually want to die; it was a subconscious ploy for attention. This isolated me and confused me to the point of almost jumping off a balcony. This sub saved me. No joke. On that balcony I wrote my suicide letter on an anonymous account and the responses were immediate and kept me going. I don't remember who responded, but if you remember a balcony suicide note months ago, your messages stopped me from jumping. Thank you. 5. Acceptance I'm not doing DBT and I only go to therapy if I want to. A lot of people in here will take issue with this, but it is the path I am choosing. I can be a cold, manipulative demon- yeah. But only to people who mess with me. I'm upfront with people about it. Don't mess with me; you will pay for it at some point and you probably won't know it was me. I don't need or want to change that. It keeps people from getting out of line. I am obsessive. My friend's think it's cute, and honestly? I like caring more about people than most people do. I like being a ride or die. I like digging into how people tick. They might think I'm creepy at first but anyone who's known me for years actually gets it and appreciates it. I have mood swings. It makes me interesting. I always say what's on my mind. I make life adventurous. I don't want to be neurotypical. Society can call me infected if it wants to, but I never liked society anyway. I think the greatest pain I've experienced was thinking that something was *wrong* with me. Even before the diagnosis, that was my greatest woe. Getting diagnosed only made me feel that even more. I've been living as an ""untreated BPD"" for 7 months now. And from the bottom of my heart, loving myself for who I am right now stopped the gut wrenching pain. I still get suicidal sometimes. But I actually started tracking it and found that I get suicidal right before my period each month. I'm not sure anyone else here will be on the same page but I wanted to throw this out there. "

This way, if you're going over a skill in group or individual therapy and don't quite understand it, you'll be able to search and find some examples to browse through, and maybe be more likely to find something you click with. If you want to see more like this, or have something of your own to contribute, you're welcome to join us. There's not a whole lot of content yet, but hopefully these posts will help us get more contributors. I chose this post because it was the most upvoted skill posted this week, and the original poster gave permission for it to be used. I hope you guys find this helpful! \----- Found this through [r/BPD](URL I really like the idea of this sub; talking through examples was the best part of DBT. ***In case you are new to this skill, or need a quick refresher, I've typed out a worksheet that may help those who want to practice this skill, but don't know (or remember) where to start:*** &gt;**Observing and Describing Emotions** **Emotion Name**: (Anger, Envy, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Jealousy, Love, Sadness, Shame, Guilt)**(try and pick ONE)** **Intensity**: (0-100) **Prompting Event**: (What happened to prompt this emotion? Who/What/When/Where?) **Vulnerability Factors**: (What happened before that made me vulnerable to the prompting event?) **Interpretations**: (Your beliefs, assumptions about the situation; may not be based in reality) **Face and Body Changes and Experiences**: (What was I feeling in my face and body?) **Action Urges**: (What did I feel like doing? What did I want to say?) **Face and Body Languag**e: (What was my facial expression? Posture? Gestures?) **What I Said**: (in this situation) **What I Did**: (in this situation) **What Aftereffects did the emotion have on me?**: (my state of mind, other emotions, behavior, thoughts, memory, body, etc.) *(from DBT Skills Training Handouts and Worksheets, Second Edition. M. Linehan)* A skill that ties in nicely with this one is **\[Opposite-to-emotion-action\]**, once you've determined the emotion you are working through. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ **Here's how I used it:** I first used this skill last year, when making steps to apply for university. Understanding this skill as well as using **opposite action** skills to deal with certain emotions that were not contributing to my goal helped me make it through the process. Been using this skill almost every day this semester, as each day brings new school-related stressors and emotions (usually fears) that need to be **identified** and dealt with as soon as they come! Continued in the comments: Here's a sample using the template above: &gt;**Emotion Name**: Fear **Intensity**: 45/100 **Prompting Event**: Had an exam later on in the day, and needed to do some more preparation and studying. **Vulnerability Factors**: This was a very challenging course, and my exam mark could influence my admission into a program. **Interpretations**: Felt like it was too late; I will be unprepared and fail this exam *no matter how hard I study now.* **Face and Body Changes and Experiences**: wanting to run away and avoid, had a sick feeling in my stomach. **Action Urges**: I wanted to self sabotage by watching TV, browsing reddit, or anything unrelated to studying. **Face and Body Language**: visibly stressed **What I Said**: I texted some classmates and told them I would be at school in an hour to study and to come join **What I Did**: Packed up my books and left the house; treated myself to a coffee that I brought to school to study. Arrived before I was supposed to meet up with my classmates so I went to see my professor and asked questions on some of the more challenging course content. **What Aftereffects did the emotion have on me?**: Once I was at school, this emotion subdued enough to be helpful; I was able to study a fair amount with all the adrenaline. Would start to drift into the kind of panic where there's no way back, dealt with by walking around the building for 10 minutes before returning to my study group."

103,vulnerability,BPD,I told my daughter I love her unconditionally and I do so very much but I am struggling,1,aolrc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/aolrc0/i_told_my_daughter_i_love_her_unconditionally_and/,2019-02-09 09:11:06,"I am not even sure this is something I should do. I am so afraid right now of saying, doing, or writing anything that can and will probably be twisted into something different than what I intended it to be, that my vulnerability will continue to be used against me. I don't know how to explain this or even where to start and I just want it to stop so badly. There does seem to be a family legacy of dysfunction and ultrasensitivity that there is no escape from, the only hope is for an attempt to recognize and heal in a way that allows us to just try to do better and not by way of judgment but unconditional love and acceptance. I am good at that part, so good it is bad. Boundaries... I suck at setting and enforcing my own boundaries because I confuse unconditional as accepting the unacceptable without accountability. Geeze, did that even make any sense? &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure I want to share this on here. I have seen some pretty horrific responses and that isn't the kind of support I want to receive nor generate. I am going to trust that my intentions are for something more constructive and that this alone sets the tone for what follows... So enough and geezus my heart rate just kicked up, fear, ridiculous fear. Last night as I laid in bed next to my husband snoring away, a furbaby sprawled out down by my feet and my 17-year-old son across the hall... I know I am surrounded by people who love me, know me for who I am at my core, and yet I'm struggling with feeling like I am going to shake apart with my nerves feeling like my body sounding a high alert after repeated attacks and realizing there is no end to it... at least not the way I am managing right now and I am working on understanding/accepting/modifying my behaviors that contribute to this pattern of behaviors. My heart is clenched the emotions intense enough to be physical pain. I feel so desperate, scared, and still in shock. I placed my hands over my heart and worked really hard at keeping silent but really wanting to wail as I held my breath and bit down on the pain. All I could think of was that I have been told to do... detach... detach... I'm trying and yet I know that I am still struggling to accept that there is nothing I can do to change this. If my husband would have rolled over and witnessed what I did next... well I'm not sure what he would think. Detach... how do you even do that? The loudest thing in the room for me was the pain in my heart so I figure that is where I can start. I imagined the cord that attaches to my 25-year-old daughter and held my hands there for a moment as I embraced my love for her which is hurting me so much right now, then I pushed down on the pain that makes me feel too much of a victim when embraced for too long, I actually feel pain like pressing on a bruise but noticed it was not throughout my whole body racking my nerves, it was directly under my hands like it was tangible, weird but okay I am staying present and feeling what I feel while doing my best to self regulate and take control of the extreme emotions. I do not question it while no one is watching me wondering if I need a white coat with extra long white sleeves. Then I grabbed that imaginary cord with both fists and pulled up holding it at arms length allowing myself to feel one last moment of the intense heartache silently saying I love you to my daughter, then turning my fists away from me I open my palms and I imagine releasing it again saying silently to my daughter that I love her but this time knowing my intent was to detach. I pushed with a bit of force to demonstrate a boundary I wanted to set. I did this again with the pain I feel in my stomach area (I want to say womb but that just smacks of being dramatic and sharing this is already feeling like I am being overly dramatic). I looked up the definition of detachment- the state of being objective or aloof. Aloof doesn't sit well with me, that is the kind of mother I grew up with and although I love her for who she is, it definitely caused me to have patterns of behavior that struggle to be aloof with my children. I see the next search return and it makes more sense for me without a reaction; In psychology, emotional detachment is the avoidance of emotional connections. ... This detachment does not necessarily mean avoiding empathy; rather, it allows the person to achieve the space needed to rationally choose whether or not to be overwhelmed or manipulated by such feelings. Whoa... okay this I can understand and be okay with... now I just need to work on doing and recent events definitely do not make it easy. For almost six months my daughter has been telling me about BPD, specifically, a book her and her fiance were reading together (walking on eggshells) and this thing called Reddit where she gets lots of good information from a subreddit called BPD. For months I listened to her and learned about her diagnosis of BPD. This is not hard for me to do and I have had years of being able to listen to her share with me a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety, Complex PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder; it does take effort to not be hurt but gets easier and easier to not take personal offense to statements from your independent adult daughter when she tells you her therapist told her she was raised by wolves or that her future mother in law has been apologizing in a letter to her for saying bad things about her mother... I would respond with a why would they say this and she would always say she didn't know... but I have always known that she has her own experience with others and part of bonding with others included sharing her pain. I had witnessed her do it since she was young and navigating the effects of divorce and her family moving on to make new families which my sense was that she never felt like she was truly part of... this is the history I am waiting to share/talk about with her and even the experiences that came before from when life got flipped upside down resulting in a marriage ending and how at 3 that clearly had an effect on her and myself at 25. I must accept that this type of sharing in hopes of healing may never happen because she is in this space that is focused on how broken she is. I knew this and yet I still held in listening and learning about her, acknowledging my imperfect parenting and apologizing with genuine remorse for what I know now that I did not then. I have not included in my apologies any justification that talks about how difficult it was for me with her volatility and intense emotions that were more than I knew how to respond to. I was the parent that was going to do it differently and talk to my child, reason with them... but at 3 that stopped working (my heart breaks and there is guilt when considering what was going on around her this being when her father and I divorced and there were other immature/selfish choices made with little to no regard for how it was emotionally and mentally affecting her). I think if I could just go back and do it again with what I know now and yet I have to wonder if it would be any better, look at where we are now. I couldn't reason with my 3-year-old and all I had left was what I myself was parented with and ""get ahold of yourself"" was what I resorted to when nothing else I had wanted to do as a mother myself worked. I'm still struggling with knowing what to do and I have to smirk at the irony when I think about all I can control is myself and so then... ""GET A HOLD OF YOURSELF!"" is what I am left with but not for her, but for me. For months she talked about this resource and one day as she laughed at my ignorance of how large of a following there was I googled it while on the phone and was like dang 300 million users; when we got off the phone that day I signed up and picked my subreddits or whatever they are called struggling to get past an easy 3 of Keto, Earth Porn; and yes BPD. Over the next few months, I would here and there I would occasionally sign on and read posts. About a little over a month ago my daughter calls me and tells me about some video or article (I cannot remember specifically which while it usually was one or the other) and this time she didn't have the link in that moment to send over FB messenger, she said it was on BPD and she would send it. A day or two later when I sign on I try to look for what she was talking about and discover how to choose ""controversial"" and ""past week"" hoping to weed out what she had been trying to tell me about. One of the top three posts returned interested me with the title asking if DAE (I still am not sure what that means) is triggered by their mother, why yes I am in a quiet way and I know my daughter is in a much louder way. I begin reading still wanting to learn about how it happens, why, and what is better... then one of the first few comments hits closer to home than any other shared experience, not exact but damn near. I click on the user name and the first post I read is clearly my daughter writing about my brother's suicide last year. The very next boldface title of a post shocks and scares the shit out of me because my daughter describes a phone conversation we had just had the week prior that is so twisted from what it was and I am really worried about her perception of it. I wanted to paraphrase and not do what she is now doing on here but I didn't want to say it wrong so I just went to her account to try to get the exact words and let me tell you the fear of what I might see and trying to quickly look for the one post and not focus on all the others since that is so very hurtful and scary for me in seeing how her perception or at least her what she shares takes things out of context, leaves out her interactions, embellishes some truths, and leaves me with whiplash from where we were not just one month ago. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, here it is and screw it at least it isn't screenshots of our messages which she is now doing: \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* Today my mom casually said she feels like she doesn't see the point in living... And I never know how to respond when she says things like that... Just. Fuck. Because I honestly don't see the point either sometimes... a lot of the time really...it's like being passively overwhelmed with life itself, not just the things in it... My entire existence is just too much. &amp;#x200B; Knowing she feels this way too makes me feel so much worse... Especially since I'm the only person who she can talk to that understands it. I feel like I'm failing her by not responding helpfully, but I feel like a hypocrite when I try to, and I'm resentful that I have to respond to this at all. &amp;#x200B; Just. Fuck. \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* I sat with this for a few days not knowing what to do or how to approach it because I know from experience there is no ability to discuss events while she sees things very black and white as facts and facts are her feelings and to question anything or offer another perspective that would be different than her own is to invalidate her feelings and that is how we got here in the first place. If I was the swearing type this is where I would share in her expression... Just. Fuck. I thought about not saying anything but I worried about the post about my brother's suicide and the very next one being this post. Did she think I was suicidal? I finally decided I wasn't comfortable talking to her about it to clarify that I had not said what she posted in the way she describes... again out of context, leaving out her interaction, embellished some truth... So I called her, we talked for a few minutes like usual with her typically calling me daily for a while then every few days and when there is a week passed I would reach out to her and usually, there would be something that had caused her to be more introverted... I get it, always have and only because I am the same in that way. After a few minutes, I tell her I want to talk about something; I admit I probably tried too hard to communicate on the front end in an attempt to let her know we can talk about anything without any fear of rejection or judgment and reflecting on it from what my best guess in how it felt for her was that it just made the anxiety greater waiting to hear what it was that I wanted to say. I said I think I stumbled across your Reddit account. She laughed and said I doubt it and she has 5 different usernames. I said no I think it is yours and said the name, I literally heard the air around her sucked in as she held her breath and oh crap I know what this means. I began to panic and told her it is okay that we can talk about things just like we have been for months now, that I wanted to understand and was worried about what I had read. I even begged a bit saying please don't check out please just stay here with me for a moment and try to talk to me... she eventually spit out something that communicated say what you want to say. I told her that I had read the post about my brother's (her uncle's) suicide and that the post after that is what scared me. I asked her if she truly believes that I had said what she described in her post and she said with irritation ""Yes"". I said okay then I want to talk about that phone call because that is not what I intended to communicate at all and actually the opposite. I began to share my recollection: She had expressed being depressed for a few days more than usual and I acknowledged her feelings then I did the thing I think I should never do again... I tried to do the mom advice and said that I could relate to what she had said and that while I have experienced what it feels like to wake up with nothing of a schedule that makes a demand of you for the day, no set plans, to then go to bed and wake up just to do it all over again that eventually, you feel like ""what's the point?"" that is exactly what I said to her and then I talked about what I do to work my way out of that feeling, I briefly gave the few examples of different arts and crafts that I do telling her creating something helps for me and then, of course, having a purpose such as the volunteer work I do... I left it with I get it and I am sorry you are feeling depressed. Our conversation went on and we talked about other things, the mood lifting for her and I thought the conversation was positive. I finished reviewing my recollection and then asked her what would leave her to think I was saying something very different, she responded with something that points to being the type of person that sees or perceives things as negative and I asked if she thought maybe even that she perceives things as worst case scenario negative and she responded with irritation saying something to the effect of like duh mom welcome to my party. The call was long more than 3 hours and it was painful, she did say she was not comfortable and I tried to help her feel comfortable. I can see where this was triggering her and me in my own way but differently. She isn't afraid of being iced out, she is the one that does that and I am the one that fears abandonment because I grew up with a mother that did the ice thing for weeks at a time. I even at one point said let's try to talk about something else like the weather, or tell a joke... I really didn't mean it to hurt her or be toxic I was desperately trying to let off some of the pressure and she was not saying she wanted to go just that she was not comfortable. The majority of the call was not spent this way, in fact only less than 15 minutes was excruciating for both of us but we pushed past it and started to talk. She talked to me, related to her experiences with her fiance as an adult in a relationship we spent the hours sharing and there was no more expression of being upset. I finished by telling her I loved her very much and that I would try not to worry about her after we hung up and asked that she not freak out over the fact that I had seen her Reddit account because. &amp;#x200B; What has happened since is something much worse than I have ever experienced with her and in one phone call, we went from talking regularly, planning her wedding, visiting venues and taking her and her fiance out to lunch for vegan food, shopping for her wedding dress together, meeting with photographers... I have been described as intentionally seeking out her Reddit account and she fails to tell it as it happened, does not share that she told me about it and shared from it for months talking up how helpful it has been. She does not share that we have been engaged in talking about BPD including me giving her the DBT workbooks I had ordered for myself. She does not share the details that would describe something very different and what is worse than reading the horrible comments that call me a monster a bitch hoping I die in a ditch and much worse... what is worse is that she believes what she is spinning and the reinforcement and encouragement of others is... something that I fail to see as healthy constructive or supportive and yet this place is supposed to understand BPD. She shares a video that I shared about splitting and yet she does not share that a month ago she admits to me her realization and conversation with her future MIL that several years ago she split on her own mother. She told me this, she posts about what it is but I don't understand if I am just not informed correctly to think that is exactly what is happening. She claims that I have violated her privacy and describes this as a pattern from childhood reading her diary looking for evidence of her talking bad about me. Yes, I did read her diary occasionally when she was a teenager and threatened to harm herself, was dumped by a boyfriend and had him cornered in the instrument room with a band teacher looking frozen in shock and anger telling me to get her out of there. Letting the boy get past her telling him to go as I held her and then her breaking free from my hug and screaming his name over and over at the top of her lungs as she ran out the door into the school parking lot screaming and screaming running after him. I told her that there are moments when parents have to go further and while that happened several times with her it happened only once with her brother recently again justifiable and I couldn't even read it all myself and didn't. Point being is that I did not go looking for this and I am most definitely struggling with not looking at the horrific trainwreck on display in public just like you cannot drive by without rubbernecking in real life driving past a mangle of metal. I guess Reddit is open to the public but considered a violation of privacy when read by an unknowing select few. Regardless, I now have more insight than I care to really have, but I have what I really do need after years of just listening and I now know what I am validating in front of others when she says things and I don't challenge it because I had no idea of how bad it was and really I was okay with her managing her own relationships getting what she needed... I just can't do anything about all that and yet I want to be in my daughter's life. I want to be part of her wedding planning I have only one daughter and yet now reading her statement that her fiance believes that what I have done so far is in an effort to make up for what I did in the past... She describes me messaging her asking if her and her fiance are okay and she twists it in a way that becomes something very different from the truth because she leaves out her message to me saying she just can't handle this especially while she is struggling with ALL her important relationships; yes she capitalized ""all"" and my mistake was worrying that she was not only having this breakdown with me but that she was with her fiance as well and that worried me knowing suicide is a real concern. She describes me involving her brother who is 17 and yes six years younger but was present for every day that was not easy for anyone not understanding or knowing how to help her self regulate extreme emotions that didn't care about anyone else or how it affected them. I asked him about what she claimed I was like because this whole thing makes you feel crazy like questioning yourself with how adamant she is when I say I don't remember some things she describes and her immediate snapback is that she isn't surprised because when you are raging there is a tendency to black out or something like that. What do you say to that? My son doesn't remember it her way either; that really doesn't matter one way or another but in trying to check my own self and seeing how one can delude themselves to the point of complete blindness to their own behavior thus making them truly the victim of their own horrific experiences... this is where I just must stop my dysfunction in all this and that does scare me. My mom shut my brother out of her life for almost two decades living just 15 minutes apart and it absolutely destroyed my family, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, cousins.... it just keeps spreading like a disease and there was nothing I could ever do about it.... but I was going to try to do better... I did the opposite and yet here we are and I don't know what to do with the fear of a repeating legacy no matter what road you choose to take. I realize that there is so much of my own trauma that is escalating this for me too and I am trying to be better at managing this. &amp;#x200B; There are grains of truth in some of what she believes but the best way I can describe how it feels or seems is that it is her first-person perspective of as a child, a child that was extremely sensitive and struggled with self-regulating emotions now as an adult stuck in a pattern of blame and while a child would not be expected to own this behavior what do you do with an adult doing this? &amp;#x200B; This is a good place to shut up I think and move on to something else for the day, I think of all her posting and cringe at how she must spend her days immersed in this form of what she finds supportive... &amp;#x200B; I am fully aware of there being a need for healing and change on my part and behavior, that does not change how painful this is for me but what will change that is to not to wonder how she is doing or look any longer at the neverending wreckage of our relationship on Reddit, not to reach out anymore myself. I did that two days ago after almost a month of no contact and under the advice and suggestion of my therapist; she suggested a letter and warned me why and my stubborn ass didn't know how to communicate love in a letter as well as I could face to face. I don't really feel like going into what she has now done since because yet again it got even worse and now screenshots of messages are linked and I give up fighting for a relationship that is not currently good for either one of us. I did learn that no contact for the past month resulted in no horrific postings and she was successful in making it clear that no good for her nor I will come from any attempt to reach out to her. &amp;#x200B; God grant me the serenity To accept the things I cannot change; Courage to change the things I can; And wisdom to know the difference. Living one day at a time; Enjoying one moment at a time; Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace; Taking, as He did, this sinful world As it is, not as I would have it; Trusting that He will make all things right If I surrender to His Will; So that I may be reasonably happy in this life And supremely happy with Him Forever and ever in the next. &amp;#x200B; Amen. &amp;#x200B; I have heard the serenity prayer before and even said it, but never have I felt what it means to say it with the desperation of your weakest moments and the strength it asks for help with. I cannot change what has happened. I cannot change what others have done, are doing, or will do; this I want to accept and ask for the courage to change the things I can. I pray for wisdom, guidance, and the experience to know the difference between what is mine and not mine to embrace and something sooner than hindsight much later would be nice :) Sorry for the rambling, it has been a very hard time for me and it happened so suddenly it is all very surreal and I admit I am definitely discombobulated... I have been spending time looking at pictures reading old emails and letters from when she was younger struggling and I would write to her saving it but never able to share it with her. Videos and pictures of her with family and friends, birthday parties with her laughing and smiling and I wonder if she tells others she never even had a birthday party thrown for her. I pulled out from the back of one of my bookcases a journal I bought when she was almost 16, just about the time things got really rough with dating boys and how unstable that would leave her (all of which I could relate to but I seemed to implode during those struggles while she explodes). This journal is called ""Just Between Us"" with guided entries to share and fill in back and forth with one another, all evidence of who her mother was and still is... one of the first entries I completed asks my favorite word and my answer... discombobulated and yes that about sums it up nicely for me in a way that is lighthearted and I really need that right now."
104,vulnerability,BPD,BPD &amp; Vulnerability?,1,ap7cct,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ap7cct/bpd_vulnerability/,2019-02-11 06:28:57,"I have a LONG family history of BPD, but my family members with BPD have a lot of traits of NPD, and I endured years of abuse and manipulation from them. Now I go to therapy and I have a type of PTSD from living with that. But I know I fit pretty much every single criteria for BPD. I typically lie to psychiatrists about how I feel bcuz I don't want to be seen as a manipulative abusive piece of shit. I know that's not how all people with BPD are, but my family members were on the more so narcissistic side and could be truly nasty. So because of my experience with them, I feel like I will be viewed as a manipulative piece of shit by every doctor ever if I'm honest and get a diagnosis. I almost feel like in a way my BPD/NPD family members have ""won"" if I get a diagnosis, even though I am NOT nearly as nasty as them. What do you think?"
105,vulnerability,BPD,Letting go of BPD...,1,apqxj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/apqxj2/letting_go_of_bpd/,2019-02-12 18:44:52,"I got diagnosed almost 5 years ago, I was young and the diagnoses made so much sense at the time. Ive grown up with believing that I have personality disorder, and that it was who I was. Ive felt stuck in this illness, angry at its causes and like I didnt have a true personality, just the disordered one I have been handed. At the time it was comforting, I fit all the criteria and it all made so much sense. Ive formed friendships based on this, but Ive really been in an unhealthy relationship with my diagnoses for too long now. We are co dependant, and Ive hid behind the vulnerability of it. But recently I had two quite sever breakdowns. And people stopped to actually think about my symptoms and reactions and its now been concluded that Im not borderline. I have bipolar and autism. Theres something about knowing that this illness wasnt caused by anything except genetics (it runs in my family) and a cruel hand being dealt that is so strange. It feels like there is something wrong with me, instead of someone or something making me this way. But I also know that this makes much more sense, and that bipolar is what Ive always been. But now I have to let go of such a huge part of me. I must let go of the toxicity of my relationship to this disorder. All the excuses I made in the name of it, the pain I suffered and the shield it gave me. It sounds silly but it really is such a big part of my life, and has shaped me so much to now be told something completely different feels as though half of me has been ripped away. So I am saddened to have to say goodbye to the community, as my place is no longer here. I hope this all makes sense and doesnt come across in any bad way. It doesnt even really make sense in my own head, these feelings are so hard to understand. "

But it was like... reallyyy bad. Not sexually abused by my father level of bad but like... realllyyy bad even for abuse. (Although just to clarify every form of hurting someone is awful and you cant quantify or compare pain and at some point I think you just hit max pain and also yeah. You should never compare pain, Im just saying that to clarify Im not like making stuff up or anything). I dont really talk about it coz it like freaks people out but oof twas not fun... The point is, Im supposed to have dealt w/it. Im 17 so I still live w/my mom but shes change like drastically because she and my dad got divorced and like Ive been in therapy. Ive thought about it. Ive healed. Ive cut myself off from my old self. Im better or whatever. Ive been careful to never hurt anyone else (lol I genuinely think if I ever even slapped someone Id try to kill myself I dont think I could cope with that guilt. Its one of my biggest fears. But I think Ill be fine coz I have a lot of positive people in my life). But some nights, like tonight, Ill just sort of think about it. And idk why coz its like not good for me to think about and I dont know, it was such a distant time it doesnt even feel real to me anymore. And Ive like blanked out most of the physical stuff in my mind. But I just... sometimes it comes to my mind. Maybe its like having a pity party for myself or whatever. Im not sure. I just feel sort of angry and sad and vulnerable and oof. Also does anyone else get weird bursts of feeling vulnerable? For some reason when my boyfriend like touches my chest and me in general in a certain way I get hit by this intense wave of vulnerability and I dont know if it feels bad or not but its... intense. Im sort of frozen not really speaking etc. But anyway, Ive gotten better and stuff because I thankfully started therapy decently early (16) so I think I managed to heal before the damage got really cemented but... oof. I dont know why I think about these things. I mean I think about them in a very detached way too, not crazy no emotion detached just like, not feeling the emotions around it. I can think about it now and be okay with it (again probably partly because of me blanking it out but also its really hard to hate people youre codependent with and who you like.. love and who raised you. Even when they were fucking awful to you. Especially if they change and are now very likeable...). But its just.. weird, yknow? "
107,vulnerability,BPD,Found out my FP is just manipulative and doesn't actually love me at all (feeling like a BPD stereotype today),5,auu2af,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/auu2af/found_out_my_fp_is_just_manipulative_and_doesnt/,2019-02-26 13:52:47,"My FP is for the past few years is my academic mentor. Shes easy to talk to so Ive gradually confided in her a lot about my life, including my history of trauma and my ongoing struggle with mental illness (specifically never mentioned BPD though) and she encouraged me to seek formal treatment (which I did). Last year she started saying that she loves me, and started hugging me (never any sexual vibe). At one point I was literally crying while she hugged me, which was incredibly meaningful for me because Ive never had a relationship in my life where I felt comfortable enough to do that before For the past few months Ive been stable and functioning relatively well. The last time I talked to her several months ago she gave me this big project to work on (its totally redundant and pointless, but I get to work with her so I dont care). But for past few months she hasnt replied to my multiple texts/emails I wondered why she wasnt answering me when before she got back to me right away (before that the was even a couple of times when she even texted me randomly to say that she is thinking about me and she loves me). So I asked around. Turns out she is not just busy, she is just a really manipulative person who says stuff like that to make people feel special that they are close with a faculty member so theyll do whatever she wants and then never follows up because she doesnt actually care. So now I feel really hurt and betrayed and stupid for letting myself be 100% taken in by her bullshit. She was the first (and only) person that I actually trusted, so now I dont know what to do. If she would have told me to jump off a cliff I would have done it. And the worst part is that shes a fucking PSYCHIATRIST so she fucking knew the effect that her words and actions would have on me given my history. I feel betrayed in the worst way because she used my greatest vulnerability against me. Right now, Im just trying to focus on taking care of myself and avoiding the urge to be self-destructive (because being self-destructive is literally the worst thing you can do when you find out that someone doesnt care) Please dont interrogate me about details. I just want to vent to people who understand. "

My best friend (bro), his gf and two other girls were at my house to drink something and, well, just chill. I remember times when my bro and I drove around, or just drank together, being bros and being together, just both of us. Recently, it started to be more like this: he is with his gf and I am sitting there and...chill more or less alone. Like we are in the same room, but we don't socialize. Same today. So today the other girls were also there, so I was not all alone, but when my bro said they'd all leave soon, I was already very upset. I drank with the girls and tried to stay happy somehow, because I didn't want to be upset, I am happy for my bro and it's stupid to be upset somehow. But the girls went out of the room to talk about girls stuff, and the situation now was this: My Bro and his gf were cuddling on my couch not even noticing me, and I was sitting there, drinking and being upset. After some time, I started to cry and went out of the room. I didn't want to be such a drama queen again, I stopped all behaviour which is ""Borderline"" like this some time ago, because I wanted (and still want) to get rid of this vulnerability, I don't want to be hurt anymore, but my bro is the most important person to me. Anyhow, he noticed and we talked about it (on Whatsapp because there were other ppl around) and I told him that I didn't want to put the shame on him and his gf, and that I was quite drunk, but that I was upset that we don't hang anymore without his gf, and he was very understanding, saying we will hang again, just the two of us. I am very happy to have him, because he is very understanding and he is an inspiration to me in some other ways, but I am ashamed that I did this crying thing, which at last everyone had noticed and everyone said something like ""Idk what's up but it'll get better"" when they left. I don't want to cry, I don't want to be vulnerable and I don't want to have BPD! I haven't had any symptoms for weeks, and now this starts again :( Does anyone know how I feel?"

112,vulnerability,BPD,Unwelcome in my DBT group because I am male,32,ayjaer,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/ayjaer/unwelcome_in_my_dbt_group_because_i_am_male/,2019-03-08 10:29:55,"This past fall I was finally diagnosed (at 23) with BPD after consultation with a psychiatrist, and was referred to a DBT group for treatment. Unfortunately, I am the only male in the group, and both instructors are also female. I was hoping that there would be other men in treatment, but the majority apparently don't seek help in the first place and often drop out right away after being placed in a group. Initially, I was feeling good about being in a place with others who could share in some of the same experiences. The group instructors made it very clear at the outset that we were to not get too one another and were forbidden from meeting outside of group or exchanging contact information. I 100% understood the reason for these strict rules and have and always have maintained a respectful distance from the other members in the group, all of whom I very much enjoy sharing with and hearing them share about their own life experiences. I felt like when they were directing that message at me directly, but I brushed it off at the time. Every other week, we meet with a counselor individually who helps us with the group homework, checks in with how things are going, etc. At my check-in with my counselor three weeks ago he told me that he had met with the two group instructors, and that they had some concerns about me in the group. I was pretty taken aback by him saying this, but was eager to learn what it was specifically they were having problems with me for. Apparently, one of the instructors felt like I spent too much time looking at her (hard not to look at the person leading the group) and they were also concerned that because of the vulnerability of the women in the group, my presence as a male might make them feel uncomfortable. I asked if anyone from the group had come forward with complaints about me, as from my perspective we all had a really great relationship, and he assured me that no one had made any complaints, and that the concerns were from the group instructors only. I continued to inquire with him what specifically the concerns were, and he made some vague reference to the fact we're living in the ""me too"" era and also mentioned that I was ""an attractive guy."" This really shocked me and I'll admit my initial reaction was anger, as I felt and still feel it was wholly inappropriate to be made to feel unwelcome - particularly in a place of treatment and where there's an expectation of vulnerability - for simply being an ""attractive guy. I know this story sounds too ridiculous to be true, but I promise I've been 100% transparent about everything that's gone on. The following week, I went back to the group and everything was fairly normal, save for the subtle hostility I've felt from both of them since joining the group (less patience with what I share, overreaction when I didn't complete the homework to their satisfaction, etc.) I just had my next follow up meeting with my counselor and he started the meeting with ""I'm not sure this is right place for you."" He then went on to describe how my BPD symptoms are mild, how I barely meet the criteria, etc. Without directly saying it, the message was that maybe it'd be best if I drop out of the group. We then had a discussion on the same points from our last meeting, with me asking specifically what it was that I had done that warranted him bringing these ""concerns"" to me. He could tell that I was getting a bit upset about it, so he softened his voice, asked me if I was feeling suicidal, etc. I left that meeting with no more insight in to why my presence is so threatening, and feeling very unwelcome. I'm not sure where to go from here. Do I go back to the group? I very much like the people in my group but I feel like my ability to be vulnerable and share openly has been compromised now knowing how the group instructors feel about me. I'm thinking of maybe consulting with the psychiatrist who oversees the entire DBT program at the hospital. Unfortunately, the only other DBT option in my city is private pay and very expensive. TL;DR: Made to feel like I should drop out of my DBT treatment group because I'm male and as a result somehow a threat to the women also in treatment. "

I truly believe he is the best man that has ever entered my life. I think about him all the time, I dont feel as comfortable around anyone the way I feel with him. He radiates so much love and he just glows with this gentle care that blows my mind. I havent been able to have sex in weeks. He doesnt bother me for it, but I know he has a much higher libido than me. He never presses and he understands. He reminds me not to beat myself up for it because hes with me for the person that I am through and through and that sex isnt the most important thing. I sometimes find myself wanting to just sleep with some rando. I never would, because I care for my boyfriend too much, and also I lack the prowess even if I tried. Maybe its something about being unknown and I guess in that way protected. My boyfriends knows me, hes seen me in times of vulnerability. Im scared that Ive idealized my boyfriend to being this caring loving figure, that even though I find him attractive, I suddenly cant have sex with him. Because of that idea. I want to. Hes someone I love romantically and so fucking deeply and I wish I could get myself to have sex like normal couples do. Ill have sudden impulses do have sex and suddenly half way through its gone. Like the pleasure receptors in my brain were suddenly overwhelmed and I completely tip over to the other end of repulsion. Does anyone else relate?? "

I finally left my baby daddy at the beginning of the year (narcissist, emotionally abusive, big surprise). That was hard because I have such a fear of abandonment I literally NEVER leave a romantic partner. But I did it for my daughter. Not surprisingly he moved on quickly, which was painful so I decided to start dating a few months after that. And it all went downhill. I have trouble differentiating sometimes what are my BPD symptoms in a relationship and what is the guy being emotionally unavailable/ preying on my vulnerability. Guys get really attached to me at first very quickly, and then it sparks me to pretty much fall in love, and then they leave me. I was in a rltp with one guy, he ended things because he felt pressured by me but pretty much wanted everything to stay the same just without a title. I felt disrespected by that but agreed. However I then connected with someone from my past and so bc the guy I was seeing at the time had ended things I pursued the old acquaintance. Same thing, within a week he loved me, eventually got a tattoo for me in part, etc etc. it was only a month but i really thought it was real even with his exes and family members harassing me... and him being an alcoholic. I got upset one day with him and he left, went back to his ex wife, and ended things on the phone with her on the line. I was so beyond upset I did an extensive outpatient treatment for a week to stabilize. Then around this time my first super serious ex emailed me after three years. He wanted to say he was sorry for everything he did, which in part was not understanding my mental health issues. He said things that I interpreted as romantic sentiments: he saw my face in the sky one night and the universe changed, it was love at first sight when he met me, he had a gf but was so unhappy and thought he was going to be alone forever. We agreed to keep in touch but eventually he stopped responding and I noticed he was in a trip with said gf in Europe. That really messed me up bc I had totally moved on from him. I felt like he was messing with my mind but I doubt myself bc of my emotional instability and fear of rejection. I finally met someone new around thanksgiving and again, he was really coming on strong first. We talked all the time and he would call me baby and tell me he needed me in his life. After about a month again, he said he didnt want to hurt me and we should take things slow. But at that point his behavior was really a total 180 and I freaked out. He stopped responding to me. Its all blowing up in my face now. The first ex, I messaged on IG I guess because I missed him. He responded and then immediately blocked me. The day before that the most recent guy responded to a Message I had sent weeks before and he was like Im sorry I just didnt know what I wanted, Ill definitely keep in touch. No response after that. The longtime ex, I was really angry so after about two months of silence I emailed him and just said I thought it was shitty of him to contact me. I worked sooo hard to get over him and he just dropped back in like it was nothing. He waited two weeks then wished me merry Xmas and that was it. Plus theres my childs father who I have to keep dealing with. This is probably confusing... its been so confusing for me. I know I have a problem needing validation from men And have a fear of abandonment that causes me to push people away and self sabotage. But all of the messages and crazy experiences Happening at once almost, I feel like Ive been rejected by everyone at the Same time and I am majorly triggered and in a deep depression. I just needed to get this out. I cant differentiate what I did wrong and if Im just deserving of people leaving me and treating me poorly, if I pick shitty guys... or how to deal with everything now that Im completely alone. As a single mom. My brain is on fire and Im so ashamed by being essentially rejected by so many guys at once, and then being so frantic about them. And the fact that i desperately dont want to be alone- I was single until I was 19 and have spend a lot of time alone. I really dont want to go back to that. Wow that was long. I just needed to work this out. Maybe someone has some insight "
116,vulnerability,BPD,What its like to be in the field with BPD... (TW),1,aiz2de,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/aiz2de/what_its_like_to_be_in_the_field_with_bpd_tw/,2019-01-23 23:08:16,"Y'all want juicy drama? Stay tuned. So I work in the mental health field- somehow I made it so far. It's a field where you're totally naked and you've got coworkers with PhD's and vast experience dealing with PD's, who **love to psychoanalyze each other**. Add whatever clique dynamics that are prevalent in the workplace plus power dynamics and you have a very uncomfortable situation. I never got Sartre's idea of ""the gaze"" until I got into this field and was undressed by my own co-workers daily. Having BPD is the holy grail of persona non-grata in our field. Clinicians often trash pwBPD (look at Susan Heitler's articles) due to their own unresolved issues, and BPD's with shame like AJ Mahari trash BPD to self-flagellate. It's very discouraging. There are clinicians who like to help, but the norm is clinical staff talking worse about pwBPD and having worse countertransference than people with qualitatively worse diagnoses like ASPD or NPD. It's the raw vulnerability of need that invokes this countertransference when with disorders like ASPD, what you see is what you get. I really had to think about this after dealing with BPD in the people I serve and observing my own reaction. It triggered me thinking about past work experiences where I almost quit or worse due to my dynamics. I have a tendency of wanting close relationships with supervisors. As a result of this backfiring, I've become more rigid with boundaries. I noticed in my last job, a colleague with BPD traits unnaturally started spilling her woes to me in a barely veiled attempt to elicit sympathy, caring and validation, and after this my normally rigid walls came down and I formed a close relationship with another supervisor who saw me struggling due to relationship problems and wanted to help. After that I could see her slowly get annoyed with me over the course of the next year and trash talk me, and I felt betrayed, but what do you expect? Here I am, a functioning man in most respects, apparently an adult, asking for emotional babying from a mother figure. I hate inducing the scenario when I've burdened people with my need for closeness, they feel I'm getting attached, try to pry away, this makes me feel like they are treating me like a patient, I feel misunderstood, I try to make things right, only to get more blowback and Bam, the whole office knows that I'm borderline and there goes my fucking future at the agency. It's awful, the stigma, but I bring it upon myself with my disordered behavior. I'm the oldest of two children to a very disturbed and slightly sociopathic mother, and a textbook borderline father. o learned most things on my own and am bummed that this part of my personality is attached to me like a barnacle and uses my body to get it's needs met- this infant like part of me. I almost got fired from an internship because I opened my mouth about a traumatic car accident to a task supervisor in the getting to know process, and from then on any attempt to get her to provide a more direct educational role for me was misconstrued by her as some borderline thing (to be fair, that clinic called any patient with significant trauma they couldn't handle a borderline and absolutely treated them differently) and she tried to get me fired. It ended with me documenting her being abusive to me in front of patients and trying to seek help with higher ups, who for office politics reasons didn't help, so I took it to the school internship office. It's a struggle standing up for yourself and almost daily in this field you're retraumatized by colleagues who see your flaws from a mile away and treat you like the monarch of ickiness. Over a decade hasn't helped this needy inner child finally fuck off and be satisfied so I can live normally and not alienate coworkers. I have a fiance who is very supportive. Damaged herself, and I think that's the reason she puts up with me. I couldn't be more thankful, and I know that due to my disorder, I'll do worse in relationships than at work, so I likely will not get any better than what I have, so I make sure I treat her right, like a queen. We are like the emotionally homeless, looking for a home in people, and this freaks them out. I remember after my suicide attempt a decade ago where I had to be resuscitated and put on dialysis (just clarifying that no, it wasn't for attention, it was because I was deeply depressed for four years and finally fed up in an abusive relationship with my mother who used me as an emotional punching bag) the doctor took one look at me, told me I'm borderline, then when I asked him if he could stay a minute and explain to me what it means and whether I'll get better, he gave me that dreaded ""ick you're creepy"" look of disgust and walked off. That'll remain etched in my forever. It's lonely when the field that is supposed to help you hates your kind, but this is the countertransference we induce after all, right? I can't imagine it being any different than a constant train ride where ever stop is another person reminding you that you're half-human and they want to get away from you. I currently avoid my father for this very reason. He's a black hole of need and on top of this, narcissistic and selfish. He can't be happy for me that I'm getting married, instead tries to induce guilt in me for not spending time with him, even feigning cancer to get my attention. It's like dude I work two jobs and live in another state, I literally can't. So I have him blocked. I finally get why people dislike me! Ugh, shoo inner child, go suck the blood out of someone else. Interestingly, a trauma counselor told me to imagine taking care of my five year old self, and I could only imagine disgust and an urge to tell him to man up and stop crying. That was my childhood. In between frequent physical and emotional abuse, I was seen as the problem, a complainer, needs discipline, etc. Another reason why I can't forgive my parents. I want to eventually leave my field and go do private practice because most of my supervisors have told me I'm clinically excellent and diagnostically sharp. I'm always vigilant about not projecting my own shit onto clients. Then again, these compliments from bosses may just be them placating me because I'm so icky that they feel the need to protect from some imagined ""borderline rage"" they'll face for being honest with me. I don't fucking know. All I know is I'm triggered, I've started a new job and am scared shitless of my inner child putting me through the wringer again. Thanks for listening, thanks ahead for responses."

I find him to be a very real person in the midst of the fabricated reality that is the entertainment industry and his honesty about how his life is tormented with Borderline Personality Disorder and suicidal ideation is a reality that I have close experience in, given my education and work history in the mental health field. It is evident that Pete is trying his best to cope with his breakup while juggling his daily battle in feeling uncomfortable in his own skin. By sharing his struggle with BPD, he is demonstrating enormous courage by revealing his humanity on a very public platform- a vulnerability thats too often ridiculed by criticisms despite his noble efforts of trying to help others. Obviously, helping others and spreading joy through laughter gives him a sense of purpose by helping him cope with not wanting to be on this earth- an earth that has lately been invalidating and capitalizing on his very real and very raw suffering. I hurt when I read his message because anyone with true empathy and compassion can feel his hurt in the way he wrote it- and its something I can relate to in my own ways. I commend the bravery, honesty, and respect that he shows himself in what he needs to do in order to feel okay (deleting his IG, posting his feelings, etc). And for Ariana- Im extremely disappointed in her actions. Im aware that Im just an outsider to this entire situation and of course, not completely informed of all the details, but the authenticity of Petes cry for help cannot be ignored and its transparent that he is truly in pieces. He is trying to help himself by setting clear boundaries with Ariana by directly telling her she is not healthy for his life. But upon hearing about his post, she shows up uninvited anyways, serving as a sadistic reminder of his pain, all while simultaneously tweeting about her new songs release and cracking an ill-mannered joke: perverting care and concern into persistent, twisted darkness by fueling the fire of media frenzy, like throwing bloody meat into a shark tank. Did she really think her actions were truly going to help him? Ariana- I understand that writing songs is your own way of coping with life, however, I found your response to Petes message extremely disrespectful, inconsiderate, and completely lacking in class. If you truly care for Pete in the way you claim, please try to be more mindful of your public impact by listening to his request for relief by respecting his boundaries. So Pete, if you read this somehow, please know that I am praying for your healing and peace. Its wildly unfair and disgusting that your suffering is under the pop culture microscope for the sake of others entertainment and amusement. You may be a comedian but your feelings dont deserve to be violated in this way. Pete- Your life is precious. You make others smile and laugh and forget their own worries. You take shitty circumstances and cleverly craft them into something that brings hope back into this ever-darkening world. Also, you have made impactful strides in the likes of mental health advocacy- a realm I am personally passionate about- and Im so proud of you. Please know that you are seen and supported. You are heard. Not heard for a script or press release or publicity statement but heard as a humble human being who needs some light during this overwhelming darkness that can be so invasive. Your spirit is brave and worthy of happiness. I sincerely hope you find that happiness. You truly deserve comfort, peace, and healing. "

During this time I just did my own thing, safe because we had distance. Now he's back, and things are going super well. We are cuddling, kissing, laughing, joking, spending time together, watching tv, cooking, dancing.........it's magical. And this, this is fucking worse than when he's distant. This is so scary.

I'm convinced that as soon as he has money again he'll be back to being shitty. Which as I said, is actually better....but not what I want. It's honestly so uncomfortable. When we were cuddling this morning I almost told him I couldn't be in a relationship. I considered going through his texts to see if he's flirting with his ex. Sometimes he puts me down jokingly (comments like *ooh boy*) at silly things I say, and it made me want to break up with him. He's having dinner with his out of town family tonight and didn't invite me so I decided it's because his ex is going....and so I sweetly and manipulatively asked him to send me a picture of the dinner party....(without telling him the real reason). &amp;#x200B; I think that in the past, this feeling is what made me pick fights. Needing to cause drama to distract me from this fucking horrible vulnerability. Taking control by getting angry. Taking part in a painful BUT predictable cycle. Right now I am self aware enough to hold back, be patient, examine myself and hope for the best....but I hate that I can't trust myself. It's so messed up that I feel like my world is about to crash and I'm gonna get burned badly and I can't even figure out if it's true or it's my BPD. Cause as I said, this guy has issues. We love each other, but he is kind of unpredictable. Sometimes he's super loving and sweet, then the next month he's anxious and distant and drinking too much. Perhaps it's valid to leave him because of that? Maybe I can't handle it? But then again...I love him...and I can't say for sure I wouldn't have a different version of these same problems w another guy.....considering my history. &amp;#x200B;"
119,vulnerability,BPD,My sexuality is messed up anyone relate?,1,a8zdch,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/a8zdch/my_sexuality_is_messed_up_anyone_relate/,2018-12-24 10:10:20,"25 F- Just a little rant about how confusing it is for me to navigate my sexuality as someone with BPD , alongside my cultural upbringing whereby sex was heavily taboo. Unlike a lot of BPD's- my main way of coping with feelings of shame/ low self worth has been to avoid romantic relationships/sex rather than being hypersexual and constantly in relationship to relationship. I guess some of this was influenced by my cultural upbringing whereby women are heavily shamed for being sexual agents, as well as a way to avoid intimacy and vulnerability. After 2 years of therapy I decided to start dating and explore sex and wow; the amount of anxiety, confusion and intensity makes me realise why I avoided relationships until now. I find myself attracted to unavailable men, as soon as they show any interest in me or become available I lose interest. I'm only turned on when kissing men in public places, as soon as were are together in private I tend to disassociate a little and don't feel into it as much. Sex with men is hard to get to, I often feel body conscious and as well feel I need a high level of trust established for me to want them to touch me, a lot of the time I focus on giving them pleasure instead but I have enjoyed the few times that we have had sex. I wonder if all this stuff is a safety thing (I don't feel safe and so cant enjoy when we are one to one) or a sexuality thing am I gay/ bi? I had one crush on a girl when I round 10/11 but thought nothing of it and thought it was an identity crush as my later crushes in teens were men and my most intense feelings of romantic/ sexual attraction was when I was 17 to a guy in my class. However it is something that has revisited my mind now and I wonder why I'm finding relationships and intimacy with men so hard. Sigh- its a source of great anxiety for me at the moment. I hate this reverse teen process I'm going through of trying to decipher my sexuality. Its really stressful when your early 20's college days are behind you and you are going through the process of trying to maintain a full time job whilst going through this stressful feeling of not knowing your own identity and questioning everything. Its agony and I'm tired. It makes me regret dating in the first place, dating is now not fun because of all the anxieties/ triggers and abandonment fears I am getting- on top of being confused about my sexuality. Does anyone relate? I would love to know of anyone on the other-side of all of this"

So I've noticed I'm really trying to hold on to a sense of self pride to the point it keeps all people at a distance because. And that pride doesn't allow for vulnerability or oneness. For example, I dont allow conversations to evolve because I feel best if I think I'm right or in control. So even if I know nothing about the topic I'll say ""yeah"" or ""I know"" or some variant of that. Its like a verbal equivalent of puffing up my chest. Even if I try and stay interested and ask questions I feel the need to veer the conversatiom slightly off topic into more familiar territory. I get scared and it feels like my brain short circuits. Like everyone else I need connection but not enough to be genuinely selfless because I need to keep a feeling of pride too. I know it has to do with the way I was raised and childhood trauma. I know I didn't start this trend consciously. But I'm an adult now and I don't know what to do about it because I'm just realizing to what extent I'm hindering myself and my connections with others. I try to keep my head down and just listen but sometimes I come off as spacey or not engaged at all... which I guess is true if I'm not replying earnestly. (I think this is where my dissociation fits into all of this, maybe.) I just want happy, healthy friendships. Right now I feel like a robot who realizes they don't want to be a smart ass robot but wants human connections but can't access the full range of human emotions. "
121,vulnerability,BPD,Agonizing about Relationships,1,a934q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/a934q9/agonizing_about_relationships/,2018-12-24 19:01:16,"Again, with everyone relatively stable, having relationships, or the potential of one, always throws me for a tailspin. I still live at home. I have a puppy that my family wont look after for while I date. So I have a curfew. Or I get texts in the middle of my coffee date from my mother telling me to check in (overstepping as usual). But the puppy will be old enough to mesh in with the other dogs soon. Im moving out next fall. I have everything to offer a strong competent man, and yet when I have a good coffee date with this one new guy, Im just as terrified about waiting for his call, as I am about waiting for my graduate school results. I dont play games, but I let my lead. Because Ive always tried to take control and mold things to my will. And while it worked it never did in my favor. So Im vulnerable. And thats what it comes down to. Ive made myself vulnerable, so that I can open the opportunity for love. And that is SO hard for someone with BPD. You might think youre vulnerable when you throw yourself into relationships and fall in love, but those are torrid infatuations that you hurled yourself into to stir the water and create feelings and some amount of connection and company in the lonely existence of early BPD. Being able to let things do what they will. To let people decide to leave you, or take you, without your interference. To not come in so strong that they get flattened by everything you are..... But to just be open, honest, and frank, with no expectations but every hope....its scary. Its a loss of control and agenda. And its very hard. I dont like it. Its uncomfortable. But we must find our vulnerability. The soft side to display, rather than the jagged edged side. Much like the claws in parking garages that say dont back up or youll puncture your tires. You still see the spikes. You just go at them from a safe and productive angle. Its a method. Its my madness. And Im breathing into it and trying to just let it be."

You come to learn that despite their monstrous exterior, that the ball held in their hands (perceived to be a weapon/communication device) is their brain. They are peaceful and vulnerable. Whenever I'm not weak, or in a rage, I feel like an Ood with my SO. They know me at my worst, but have a disposition where my worst can change from being something we love each other through, to being ammunition against me (if that makes sense). I explode, and with humility try to analyze how I managed to do so; managed to get so big. I don't always have control or discipline, and I can get pretty ugly - but as mercurial and volatile I can be, I'm always Jekyll wrestling with Hyde - and I never miss an opportunity to learn from it. My SO has a baseline of being a sensitive, beautiful, emotional open nerve - and I have a baseline of being intense at all times. That means that in my choppy water of love and shared happiness, I have an ugly monster that pokes its head out of the water. I maintain that all feelings are valid, even if they come from nowhere. I furthermore maintain that the crux of people butting heads and growing apart is when we desperately try to justify and attach those feelings to another person, we (to be fair *I*) sometimes panic and have to attach - - I feel like we lack the humility to not have control, and can't feel things for no reasons. I stress my SO out. I have blown up and verbally disparraged her. For the most part, when a blow up happens, I try to manage it and diffuse. It has taxed her to the point where my baseline of intensity conflicts with her baseline of sensitivity. I have OCD, Tourettes, and BPD. Her own BPD has made her feel immense distress and strain. Her very valid pain right now has come from my baseline*, and she has used my very real moments as weakness as qualification for such, letting them umbrella our entire narrative and she let's it dominate our otherwise romantic and happy narrative - my episodes are a fraction of our narrative, small - but huge. I want to be better. I want to react less, and I need her to communicate more. She resents me for the help she gives me during weakness; she resents me for work she does that she never asks me to help with and it sets me up to fail. I don't want to be an Ood holding out my vulnerability any more. It sets us both up to fail. I want to be less reactionary and diffuse my explosions in a private bubble like in Monsters Inc. How can I spare her from me, and help myself? *apologies for the convolution "

(Some people say autism could be linked to filtering problem, and I also felt I was drowning in 'cues' - visual, auditory, etc) &amp;#x200B; I feel like I've always been the one to shift to accommodate another's personality and interests, so much so that I never had a chance to establish who I am. I think of it like: ""I don't know who to be, because I don't know who you are, because it's you that in me you'll see"". I'm tense and guarded around people until I know how they work, and I know how to morph and reflect them. It is not disingenuous, I just focus on our similarities and am empathetic of their view. This has also made me very presumptuous because I then categorise people and sometimes neglect their individuality which I'm ashamed of but can't control. &amp;#x200B; For me, I was the kind, polite, 'mature' child, and it meant teachers would ask for me to accommodate the more unruly children. I was the poorest and the foreign kid. I think this ingrained in me I am just 'different' and not inherently worth as much. Though maybe me being in that mindset shows I was already heading down this path, who knows... &amp;#x200B; My reflex to accommodate has made being assertive very difficult. I think like many here I am addicted to approval and fearful of rejection / abandonment. I will sacrifice more than they might even want, and at times I then even get resentful over it. I've only coped through life because in defending something else, I can be assertive. So for my work, I protect the integrity of the project, or with friends I am protecting the rule of law etc etc. If I am the victim, I have no bark and no bite. This has meant I often come out worse in platonic and workplace relationships, and it only contributes to the erosion of self-value. If you are submissive, people sometimes learn to think it is because it is how you should be. Yet, because I can be fiercely protective of those around me or things I care about, I can seem very volatile. Often the greatest fuel to my fury is my anger at being angered. &amp;#x200B; Strangely, I'm also arrogant. I think this is me being a better human that others; compassionate, caring, honest, open, dutiful, etc. The problem is that it is not compatible in an environment where there are those that are malicious and manipulative. I walk into people with open arms and occasionally suffer the inevitable stab to the back or slap to the face. It feels unjust and humiliating, it is at those times I wish I could protect myself better and just be normal. I appreciate and am so thankful to those 'normal' people that do what is unnatural to them and lower their barriers so much to the level I need as to not be insecure. &amp;#x200B; The other aspect that is a problem for me is that I am a guy. This level of vulnerability and openness is just not sexy. It is difficult to find anyone that would find me attractive. I can have female friends very easily, and I love them very much. But I still have a libido and I don't know how I could ever find someone. &amp;#x200B; My most fatal flaw is my unrealistic expectations of myself to please and comply to the world slowly leeks to those around me, and I grow more demanding of them to sacrifice for the greater good also. The closer they get to me, the more I demand they accommodate alongside me. I must drill this out of myself and is #1 thing I regret most about how I treated my first and only gf. I allowed myself to spread my insecurity to her like a disease and I don't know if I can forgive myself for that. &amp;#x200B; I think I have the brain of a worker ant: ready to die for the colony, and the heart of the puppy: too stupid to realise why, yet unbearable hurt, someone could possibly tell it off. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the rant / unsolicited autobiography"

Shes been distant for 2 weeks and I havent seen her. Last night, she finally opened up and said that she doesnt want to be physical anymore. She doesnt want the flirting, the touching, the affection. She just wants to be friends. I feel like I am going to get into my car at any moment and drive off of a cliff. We have discussed the gray area before, even making it a point to say that if we needed to establish boundaries, we would discuss it before making any decisions. The decision has been made by her and she is so firm in it. Our connection and vulnerability was on such a different, unmatched level. Now she wants us to talk just as friends and Im so angry and sad. Selfish is what I am, too. I cant force her to want more, but when she says her feelings are still there, she just cant act on them anymore because they dont align with what she wants (to be single) like what the hell. Why did we not have a discussion before she pulled the plug. Why is anything happening. She feels drained from the conversation and had closed off, requiring the day to herself, basically needing a break for the day. We were very intimate in so many ways. But she wants to cut almost everything out. Strip it down to the bear minimum, not understanding that my vulnerability stems from my affection, but she doesnt want affection. How will we continue to be deep if shes now views me as everyone else, just a friend. Where before if we had any issues or something was on her mind, she would call, invite me over, come over, etc. literally at any time of day and we would spend all night talking about it. Now she needs breaks and idk how the fuck to handle this. She states shes not retracting and confirms that shes not splitting from me. But it feels like she already has. Now when I see her, instead of everything progressing naturally, I will have to consciously think about what I can and cannot do and what I cannot and cannot say and how I can and cannot talk. "

What's up with that? It's seems like a universal of human nature. If I'm playing a video game and performing poorly, people will call me the most horrible shit and tell me to kill myself. Seems like a horrible way to treat someone. If I have an unpopular opinion on Reddit, people will instantly downvote you. It doesn't matter if you are telling the truth, it doesn't matter if you're open for a discussion, it doesn't matter how polite you are. People will just downvote you or call you names and move on, feeling comfortable with their own imagined superiority. And it makes me wonder; why are people like that? We each have a choice to build each other up or prey on each other's vulnerability, but time and time again I see people feast on the weak. It's times like that I appreciate being different. I've made a conscious effort not to make people feel bad when they're being vulnerable or expressing themselves honestly. I think the reason people do that is because they have a repressed sense of sadism which they constantly look for a socially acceptable outlet to release. I think that's coupled with the desire to feel superior to others. So if somebody has a socially acceptable way to make somebody feel bad and escalate their own perceived status at the same time, they'll take the opportunity every time. It's times like this I'm thankful for my empathy. It gives you the perspective needed to see the other person's feelings and help them build up as a person instead of taking their pain as an opportunity to raise yourself up. Sadly I don't think many of those people will change. I think they will continue living their lives selfishly and without regard to one another. And probably I would live that way, too, if it wasn't for the deep pain which taught me empathy. So I hope somebody else is grateful for their suffering, because it teaches you the lessons necessary to make you a better human."

I've been with my girlfriend a year now (from tomorrow) and it's been simultaneously the best and hardest year of my life. To say it was rocky from the start is an understatement. We both fell for each other pretty hard very fast at the beginning. I think this scared both of us and resulted in her pushing me away before anything could happen. She tried cutting me off really early on but we ended up talking again and getting back together. This was the beginning of a cycle of highs and lows... weeks of intense happiness, having fun and being love followed inevitably by a sudden period of her breaking up with me and saying we couldn't be together, she will end up hurting me, she's too broken for love, she loves me too much it hurts etc. This usually lasted no more than two or three (dark, terrifying) days which would then be followed by a period of vulnerability and dependency on her part where she would apologise, say she doesn't know why she reacted like that, that she needs me, that I should just leave her but that she doesn't want me too. I would comfort her and battle with myself until somehow we're back in the phase of intense love and needing each other again and everything seems absolutely fine for another few weeks. This cycle caused me a lot of pain, a lot of stress and worry (when will she break up with me next, is she going to hurt herself or give up on herself?), and mostly so much confusion. I had never heard of or experienced a relationship to be so turbulent and I didn't understand why this was. I knew that she had experienced childhood trauma which had left her with some issues including abandonment issues, separation anxiety and lack of self esteem and self worth but it wasn't until I accidentally stumbled across a video on BPD that everything clicked. (I want to just add here that I am completely aware that I cannot diagnose her with BPD and that she needs to be officially diagnosed before we can assume anything. ) I read up on BPD, treatments, prognosis... everything. I brought it up gently with her and suggested counseling/therapy but was met with the same reaction as every other time I suggested therapy. She insists that there is no point, for various reasons... she has tried it before and ""it didn't work"", she would need to see a doctor and then get a referral or a therapist and she can't afford that and doesn't have time, what if they tell her she can't be helped, what if they tell her she is not suited to being in a relationship, what if they tell her in order to get better she has to leave me etc etc. The main thing she says is that she finally feels she has reached this balance where she is just about coping and managing her emotions etc and therapy will upset this balance and render her unable to function, it will bring up past traumas that she isn't ready to face and resolve and she ultimately feels it will be a lot of time, money and extreme emotional pain and she doesn't see the return. I think she feels like we're managing ""just fine"" but I don't... I feel like we're barely holding it together. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, trying to protect her. I feel like I'm the only thing that makes her feel whole and she can't bear to be apart from me for any length of time. I always worry when we're apart that she won't be able handle it, she'll freak out and self sabotage by hurting herself in the most painful way she can... by hurting me. I can't continue with a relationship where I'm constantly worrying if she will cheat on me even though I know she loves me more than anything in the world. But I love her more than life itself. I want to be with her for the rest of my life and I will do anything in my power to help her, to protect her, to be there for her. She gives me so much love and devotion and every day with her gives me so much genuine joy. But I want to be able to manage those dark days because I know there will always be dark days. I don't know how to do this without therapy and I cannot force her to go to therapy. There is no point in leaving her to try and force her to get help or to tell her I'll leave her if she doesn't get help. Firstly because that is manipulative and I couldn't hurt her like that and secondly because it wouldn't work. If I left her, she would give up on herself 100% and all the work and strength she has put into trying to be better and to manage every day, she would let slip. I feel like I'm at a dead end. I don't know what to do and I would appreciate any advice."

135,vulnerability,BPD,Sister with BPD disrupting my relationship with our parents - not sure what to do,3,9ifujw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/9ifujw/sister_with_bpd_disrupting_my_relationship_with/,2018-09-24 17:06:09,"I (early 30s) have an older sister (late 30s) with BPD. She doesn't carry an official diagnosis, but I'm certain that that's what it is. She's disrupting my relationship with my parents, and I'm not sure what to do. As a kid, I looked up to her. She took good care of me, but it wasn't until adulthood that I realized how controlling and manipulative she had been. She had done things like breaking up with my boyfriend because SHE disapproved of the relationship, withholding knowledge of a later boyfriend cheating on me because she and I were ""fighting"" at the time, etc. When she is in a good mood, or if she wants something, she would be saccharine sweet. In her rageful outbursts, though, she says awful things to me, like how she wishes she'd never asked for a little sister. When I realized all of this, that I wasn't actually a terrible, stupid human being and that she was a major cause behind my severe depression, I distanced myself from her, and my life was suddenly SO much better. She didn't like this, though, because I wasn't allowing her to control any manipulate me anymore. We didn't (and still don't) speak for months on end. For a time, we couldn't even stand to be in the same room with one other. Things have gotten a bit better, but she still has frequent outbursts. Despite my attempts at no-contact, I've sometimes gone to her for sisterly advice, against my better judgement. Invariably, she uses the things I've told her in confidence during moments of vulnerability againts me, even during totally unrelated arguments about mundane things (""no wonder you're lonely in your new city and you don't have friends, you're so self-righteous, you don't care about anyone but yourself"" etc). When I've told her that her words are hurtful, she's responded that she telling me these things for my own good. So, she thinks that her behavior is justified and will never get help, let alone admit fault or that she has a problem. My overall strategy has been almost-no-contact. So here's my question. She recently moved back in with our parents, and as such, I don't know how to maintain a close relationship with them. She's a full-grown adult with multiple advanced degrees who should be starting a job, but she hasn't been looking and so is unemployed. I have a full-time job, live somewhat close by, and visit our parents often. My parents are fully aware of her personality problems and are often the target of her outbursts, too, but they absolutely will not do anything about it. I've told them that I'm certain that she has a personality disorder, but they still indulge her, which I think reinforces her behavior. I've even told them that, in the past, she's made me depressed to the point of suicidality, but they keep saying that it's all just sibling rivalry, and they're disappointed that ""you kids just can't seem to get along with each other."" In every other way, my parents are loving, kind people and I love them so much. I want to visit them more, but I don't know to navigate my relationship with my sister while I'm there. My sister's presence is deterring me from visiting them. I can't get my parents to visit me, because my sister would get INSANELY jealous, and my parents are not eager to provoke her. How do I interact with my sister in order to preserve my sanity and not compromise my relationship with my parents? Do I ignore my sister 100%? Do I speak politely with her at all times and appear completely unflappable in the face of her outbursts? Also, do I keep reminding my parents that ""this behavior is NOT normal and this is NOT just garden-variety sibling rivalry""? How do I avoid putting my parents in the middle of this situation (e.g., I don't want to refuse to visit altogether, I don't want to force them to take sides during her outbursts/arguments). If anyone who has been in a similar situation could help, I would truly, truly appreciate any and all advice. I'm at my wits' end. Thank you so much."

Ive never been able to describe whats going on with me and have someone understand. Its just so hard to put words to it. But I want to try. When Im at work (I work with kids) I am the happiest, most confident person. But as soon as I leave, Im overwhelmed with the feeling of being almost hollow. A lot of the time in high stress situations I feel like I dont know what Im feeling. Or I cant find words. Its almost like Im not feeling at all BUT on the contrary, in those same situations Im either crying or yelling or shaking. So I must be feeling? But I cant identify what it is or why. Another thing that frustrates me is my inability to form an authentic, deep connection. Ive been with my boyfriend for just over a year and my disconnect from his emotions and my explosive outbursts of unexplainable emotions are all causing huge problems. Its like I have this huge wall up where he cant get in to me and I cant let myself out to him. Its frustrating because Im comfortable with him and I trust him more than Ive ever trusted anyone yet I still cant see to open up. I feel like Im not able to even though I want to. Idk. Hes the most patient and understanding person, but when I try to explain how I just cant explain, he cant quite wrap his head around it. But neither can I. This all goes back to feeling hollow. Im afraid there isnt actually anything inside. Its really really really disheartening. Is it possible to force vulnerability? Any tips/anyone relate to not be able to identifying emotions? Does it get easier? :( "

We are also in couples counselling with a counsellor who specialises in DBT, the problem with that is my partner is highly intelligent and knows exactly what to say to get the desired result. Not taking any responsibility for their own actions and placing a majority of responsibility on my shoulders.

I'm not diagnosed with anything. I know something's wrong with me, but it's hard to tell what it is because a) I have a hard time discerning the severity of the symptoms (like do I slightly agree or moderately agree on this point?) and b) all of the PDs seem relatable somewhat. I've been watching R&amp;M lately, and the first time I saw Beth I disliked her in some sort of personal way (Idk why I was so affected). But then I watched the Pickle Rick episode. What the counselor said to her (about her irrational attachment to her dad) + Beth's reactions (deflecting, getting angry when cornered) was WAY too relatable... I'm curious, is she relatable to you guys as well? . . Transcript: Dr. Wong: Does [Rick] turn himself into a pickle a lot? Beth: What? No, what kind of question is that? Dr. Wong: The kind that wasn't designed to attack or hurt you in any way. Beth: Oh, Jesus Christ, one of these. No, my father has never turned himself into a pickle before. He's unpredictable and eccentric. The whole family is. Speaking of which... . . Dr. Wong: Oh, I think this pickle incident is a better path than any other to the heart of your family's dysfunction. I think it's possible that you and your father have a very specific dynamic. I don't think it's one that rewards emotion or vulnerability. I think it may punish them. I think it's possible that dynamic eroded your marriage, and is infecting your kids with a tendency to misdirect their feelings. [A short pause] Beth: Fuck you. . . Beth: He won't have to ask for it, okay? He won't need it. He'll just make more. He doesn't need anything from anyone. Dr. Wong: You admire him for that. . . Dr. Wong: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse. And I think it's because the only truly unapproachable concept for you is that it's your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk -to belittle my vocation- just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless by therapy, the same way I'm bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining, and cleaning is it's not an adventure. There's no way to do it so wrong you might die. It's just work. And the bottom line is, some people are okay going to work, and some people well, some people would rather die. "

I've been in pretty intensive treatment for about a year. Some things in my life changed during that time and when I got a new job that I love, I started having a meltdown (personally that is - professionally I'm doing okay.) I was talking with my therapist and we came to the conclusion that right now, I don't have anything to fight, but since I've been fighting for my whole life I can't deal with it. She said this is an opportunity for me to work on long term recovery, but I don't want to do it. It's horrible that my anger has been decentralized. I feel so upset about all of it. I'm not really eating, drinking a lot, in bed for all the time I'm not working. My therapist said I have to go back to the girl before all the abuse and let her grow but I can't even think about that. I know what needs to be done and I don't want to do it. Somehow all the pain of abuse is nothing like digging up whatever vulnerability I have stashed away for my whole life. I have that horrible, pervasive emptiness to a degree I never felt before. I'm going to work on getting through it but I just wanted to share and see if anyone has started this type of process. "

He tracked me through a post, saw my post history and started talking to me in my dark moments. He reached out, and tried to help. I was resistant. This was Reddit, after all. But after many months, and many conversations, he was vitally important to me. I was so careful. I made sure to monitor my emotions. I made sure to move slow. I made sure to keep myself contained. Don't let my imagination run away from me. Stay sane. Stay grateful. And it was easy to be grateful for him. It's rare for someone to reach me, honestly. I have a lot of walls up and I make it difficult to get to me. But talking to him was easy, relaxed, enjoyable, calming. It was incredible. Incredible. So I went to meet him. Got a plane ticket. And we spent the weekend together. He was real. He was so real. He was exactly as advertised. Being around him was just as easy and effortless as on the phone. Everything he said was interesting. He offered interesting counterpoints to my thoughts. We debated. We touched. We cuddled. And I slowly let my walls come down and begin to want. And then the weekend ended...and he started to pull away before we made it to the airport. He stopped touching me. He put up walls and talked about his job, his commitment. I wasn't sure what this was. There had been no indication of this before. Since I've been back, the texts and phone calls have lessened. He went back to his life, his routine, his job. I think the best way to put it is: he let me go. He could have held on. I would have held on. But he let me go. I've asked about it twice. I can't ask again. He doesn't appear to be malleable about this. &amp;#x200B; So, I lost it all. I lost all of it. I lost the place where I existed in my dark places. I lost the person that made me feel found. I lost the hope and confidence that I was given. I lost everything that was important to me - everything I couldn't afford to lose. &amp;#x200B; It's all I can do to not slit my wrists right now. I can't eat or sleep. My stomach is in constant knots. I want to talk to him. I want my friend. But my friend went away. And I want more than my friend, but that doesn't appear to be an option.

Were vulnerable to developing drug addictions which we could die from. Were vulnerable to getting into abusive relationships which we could die from. Were prone to impulsivity, we could rack up insurmountable debt and die from it or have impulsive sex and get an STD and die from it. Our tendency to self harm could kill us, as could our vulnerability to psychosis and unstable moods and emptiness. BPD feels like a death sentence. Even if its not a black and white clear cut suicide there are so many more slow or subtle suicides we could potentially fall prey to. Im not in a good place right now. Theyre lowering my antipsychotic dose even though Im not stable, I tried to go to the hospital to get help but got told well youve come here for help so you clearly dont want to die otherwise you wouldve done it and got turned away.

145,vulnerability,BPD,Just diagnosed with BPD and bipolar,6,952n5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/952n5r/just_diagnosed_with_bpd_and_bipolar/,2018-08-07 02:15:33,"Firstly, I am glad this sub exists. I am sorry if this is too personal, but I want to share my story and don't have anyone in my life who'd understand. For as long as I can remember, I've had symptoms that I now know are BPD related. My father left very unexpectedly when I was a kid, and I lost all of my grandparents and all of my friends in different ways over the course of the next few years. From that point forward, I obsessed about abandonment all the time. I remember getting a new dog when I was a teenager, and I counted the days until he would die. Even as a puppy. I would look at him and just feel so sad, realizing that one day he would leave me. I loved him very much, but I don't think I ever truly enjoyed a day with him. As an adult, I avoided all social relationships for fear of abandonment. I had a checklist in my head of the people I cared about, feeling somewhat strengthened by the belief that there were only a few people capable of abandoning me. But, against my better judgment, I'd make friends. Inevitably, I'd start to feel overwhelmingly anxious or insecure and would cut them off completely, often disappearing without a word. Blocked numbers, even. Never with the slightest warning. Sometimes I'd even be a huge dick and try to get back in touch with people later. Sometimes they'd let me. Who knows why. I always tried to avoid relationships because, to me, they were the ultimate form of vulnerability. I convinced myself I was asexual for most of my early adulthood in order to justify not seeking out relationships. I was the only closeted heterosexual I knew. Eventually I finally had a relationship and was over the moon for the first two months. Eventually she started talking about expectations for a husband and I, hyper-analyzing how I fell short, basically fell apart mentally. I wouldn't get out of bed for days, would cut myself for hours, and just started ignoring her for days on end. Eventually I broke up with her, mostly because I felt like the end was inevitable. It probably was at that point, but only because I had made it so. We agreed to remain friends, then after about a week I blocked her on my phone and never spoke to her again. My second relationship wasn't much better. It was years later, after I felt I had ""improved."" I had done therapy and thought I was ready. Things were great at first, then she became distant all the time - canceling things, not showing up for plans, avoiding me. It was the same stuff I had done to my ex, being done to me. I tried so hard to stay positive, even though deep down I felt all the feelings of anxiety and self-hatred bubbling up. I made her gifts and told her how I loved her. I wanted to be the strong, stable one. Of course, fear of abandonment took over big time. I pushed her to talk to me, it got worse. One day I found myself being overly pushy physically, basically begging/coercing her to make out with me even though she wasn't in the mood. Things got worse after that, obviously. We got back together. Suddenly, she stopped seeing me again and then broke it off, wanting to remain friends. I immediately blocked her on everything and haven't seen her since. These relationships were both years ago, one over 5. I miss both of them actively and constantly to this day. I am wracked by guilt over the ways I hurt both of them. And at the same time, I miss them desperately and feel like they betrayed me. In my mind, they have both returned to the idealized form they had at the beginning of the relationships. I feel I lost perfect things that I will never get back. My goal now is to never be emotionally invested in anyone ever again. I got to therapy, but I don't know how to trust myself not to feel this way or hurt others, even though I try so hard. I have been diagnosed with both BPD and bipolar 1. I don't know how common that is, but I see the logic in both diagnoses. I just feel so sad and so lost. I always have, really, but sometimes I was able to convince myself I could somehow become ""normal."" Now I know I can't. All my female friends talk about men they're dating using adjectives that are the opposite of what I am. ""Reliable,"" ""strong,"" ""understanding,"" ""responsible,"" ""together,"" etc. That's what people look for. I'm a man in my 30's who has trouble getting out of bed most days and can't hold on to any relationships, no matter how hard I try. I treat people very kindly and am always doing charity work and nice things for those I love. Most people would think I'm sweet and loving. But I can't love and I don't know how to accept love from others. I am defined by fear and confusion and when both take hold, I am no longer myself. When I become myself again, all I can do is spend my time analyzing the things I did or said or didn't do when I was lost in that fog. It's horrible. Just wanted to vent. "

I no longer dissociate, have blackouts of rage, or scary mania, or painful desperate sadness. I will always be sensitive and am still recovering from trauma, but a missed text no longer means I feel worthless and suicidal. I am still sensitive to changed plans, but I don't react anywhere near the way I used to, where I would cry and scream within the person's earshot and consider jumping off the roof. I feel things in a more integrated way, and am not overcome by tidal waves of feeling, one emotion totally eclipsing all others, requiring destructive coping mechanisms. I can calm down and think clearly in social work situations, rather than having a panic attack at being observed and asked to complete a task. I am able to be kinder and more empathetic, and am working on consistently relating to others on equal footing. I am still overcoming feelings of vulnerability in relation to other people - my next goal is to develop and maintain friendships. I have already created stable relationships within my family and with family friends. I still have a way to go, but I'm on a good path and I can tell the difference.

You're really lonely."" I laughed it off and made a joke about him projecting, but I've been thinking about it ever since. For years, I convinced myself I didn't 'have' emotions. Childhood trauma led me to thinking that I was incapable of being attached to people, so I developed a guise of faux vulnerability. Essentially, I have a bunch of things I'll use to 'open up' with new people, so they think they're getting to know me. The topics in question are pretty deep, and pretty personal, but its no skin off my nose to shout them to the world (even if it seems like only a few 'special' people know). Of course, this has worked brilliantly for getting people to open up to me so I can help them, but the more time I've spent thinking about what my friend said, the more I realise I'm not even open with myself. This has lead to a sinking feeling of loneliness I can't shake, and I feel so isolated in my own head. Every time I try to open up with people in a genuine way, I find myself reverting back to the senseless drivel I recycle with everyone else. What makes it worse is that the people I open up to genuinely think that what I'm telling them are deep, dark secrets. I guess they are, in a strange way, but I wish I could be more truthful with myself about what I'm really hiding. I don't think anything's hit me as hard as my friend telling me he *knows* that I'm lonely. I hadn't even admitted that to myself yet. Has anyone else experienced this almost 'default setting' of faux vulnerability when opening up to someone? Does it make you feel as lonely as I do? How on earth am I supposed to overcome this? "

[Long Rant],10,8v74dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8v74dq/dae_feel_completely_disabled_by_the_vulnerability/,2018-07-01 13:12:25,"It's 5 a.m and I'm in the middle of a thought rush bombardment, having slept quite well until now. It's my first post/rant, but I'm an active reader of BPD and I'm overwhelmed by the support and empathy people give each other here. For a year and a half I've been in a relationship that's given me the best and the worst of emotional experiences. It's been heavy for both my boyfriend and I, yet hugely rewarding. We've been together for a year and half now, with 2 months break. Thing is, last year I had an abortion and this 'unlocked' all my sadness and ever repressed emotions. I navigated the anger, the self-hatred and all negativity triggered with the support of my boyfriend, but as I would start to forgive myself, I realised there's a lot more anger I was never aware of before. 6 months later, having looked closely at my behavioural patterns and triggers, it was all pointing at BPD, with the clarity of where it's all rooted. Abandonment, Paranoia, no sense of self and canyons of emptiness. I'm coming to terms with it all and I'm learning it's up to me to parent the kid who's asking for validation and assurance, who wants to be good but is continuously learning how. Now that I've reached a more stable ground awareness wise and I can see why I'm angry or feeling hurt and betrayed, I can cope with it differently, and most of the times I understand the thought patterns that's generating negativity. But to get back to my initial question. When I'm alone, I can cope with my anger, my mood swings, I can establish a routine and stick to it, I can look after myself and have my symptoms on a low level. There's no pressure of having to behave in a certain way and other than occasional6 binge eating, there's no impulsivity reflected on any other areas. Ever since I've been in a relationship it's like I've turned into this kid with no perspective, hope, sense of self or confidence that things are richer now that I'm being truly loved. It's like I'm waiting to be betrayed, hurt, lied to, cheated and the anticipation is making me lose all the stability I have when alone. I turn passive and extremely weak and I'm expecting to be looked after as if my boyfriend is my parent. It's so twisted. Because seeing this doesn't change the reaction or the behaviour I display when vulnerable. Now all this rant is triggered by the fact that my boyfriend is out as I'm writing this to see a DJ we both like, but I'm away working for the next 5 weeks and he's home. I trust him (as much as a borderline can trust), but I worry and I came to rant here, because I can't ask him to be locked inside the house until I get back. I want to be good for us, but him being out is eating me inside with worries and visuals of worst scenarios. I know that being alone would avoid triggering these emotions and I was close to telling him that I can't do this anymore last night, but I've let him know that I'm not well, took a step back and told him it would be best to talk the next day because I don't want to turn this into something bigger. But it's gotten huge inside me and I'm pouring it all out here. The pain of all this is that I know (more than I know the complexity of this disorder) that we're all here for LOVE. We don't know how to accept and keep it and it's so sad because of our parents not knowing how their actions will affect our wiring we wish we wouldn't have love in the first place, just so we could be a bit more functional and stable. Rant over. Thank you for reading. "

Relationships and reaching my academic potential especially. If a thing requires vulnerability to achieve then I dont have it. You cant be abandoned if youre never attached. I was content to be high all the time and just cope my way through life. Then I met my FP, nearly had a relationship, but was then abandoned. That was my own fault. Since then Ive felt so broken and lonely. I try to better my life but it feels too late. I mistrust everyone and feel they dislike me. Im a burden. All I want anymore is love, but I feel hopelessly unlovable, and I know falling for someone again only to be rejected might literally kill me. I avoided my life for so long and now that its time to live it I cant handle anything. I dont know what to do."
151,vulnerability,BPD,I am that crazy girlfriend with BPD they talk about on Reddit comment threads,36,8jl50s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8jl50s/i_am_that_crazy_girlfriend_with_bpd_they_talk/,2018-05-15 22:22:52,"I am a goddamn nightmare and I am up shit creek without a paddle. TL;DR 7 years with the same FP, constant cheating, emotional manipulation, and other dick moves. (This is a confession and a warning in the form of an autobiography and you are not meant to root for me throughout this spiel.) I got my BPD diagnosis at 17. but even before I knew what a Favourite Person meant, I was already persistently obsessed with this kid my age, Daniel. I dated Daniel very briefly in freshman year at 14-15, two years prior to my diagnosis and one year prior to me moving upstate without any means of contacting him. Daniel was my first high school boyfriend; my first date and my first kiss. In the four short months we were ""together"" (a very loose term, we were as romantically involved as you'd expect from two kids very immature for their ages) he helped me through depression, stopped me from cutting myself in a school bathroom stall and for the first time, made me feel so valued and wanted. You can see how this would later become a recipe for disaster. My family moved away, he didn't have a Facebook or a phone and from talking every day and seeing each other every day it was as if he never existed. Between sophomore and senior year, three years of never actually seeing Daniel in person, I would still obsess over him, think about him every day, try to look him up on any social media platform, try to find his face in every crowded room, play the same MMO's hoping we would end up in the same game, find him in the background of photos my friends would upload and print out that little screencap and keep it in my journal; the whole ridiculous lot. Ever so often I'd even take an hour long bus trip to his side of town hoping we would run into each other in the shopping centre and ""rekindle"" something that was never really there in the first place. Daniel and I were together for a whole of four months, and in the first year I spent without him I had fabricated an ideal version of Daniel; he was the knight in shining armor that would save me from myself and my self destructive behaviours yet again. He was wiser than me now, stronger than me. He would sense something was wrong and call me. After all, he must be the all-purpose cure to these brand new out-of-character over-emotional and physical outbursts, the antidote to this developing alcohol and upper dependency, the eating disorder, the anxiety. He saved me once, it just makes sense to assume he WILL do it again. Over those three years I was involved with a handful of short relationships, minor crushes, a couple of one night stands, and one three-year serious relationship. I would never tell a soul about my BPD, much less any of my other symptoms or mental issues. At 16 I started dating Tyler, an all around great guy; he had the same nose as Daniel, the same crooked smile. Tyler was sweet, popular, academically involved, on a national sports team. The early months of our relationship were as ideal as a direct to DVD high school drama would picture them to be. We were compatible, we were best friends, we liked the same music. I loved him, but nowhere near the extent of how much I would obsess over Daniel. Granted, over the course of the three years I dated Tyler I would sometimes go a whole day, very rarely almost a week without Daniel even crossing my mind. This was when I started to realise when it came to issues with obsession, love, honesty and commitment my unhealthy infatuation with Daniel barely scratched the surface. Even though I had coerced Tyler to leave what was his current girlfriend for me, I would get jealous of the attention he would give his female friends and his teammates. Early on in the relationship I would catch him harmlessly flirting, or taking them out to coffee, and in retaliation I would smash his phone, call him screaming if his friends came online and I even suspected he would be speaking to them. I was a goddamn nightmare. I brought him down about his appearance, his grades, every single vulnerability I could find. His love wasn't enough. At the time I wanted Tyler to be completely devoted to me and spend every waking moment with me. I wanted him to ""love"" me exactly the way I obsessed over Daniel. Over the course of those three years I would cheat on Tyler. I would manipulate a close friend, Adam into thinking I had genuine feelings over him. But it was all a game to me, seeing how long it would take for him to obsess over me. I got my kicks from watching Adam run out half naked into the street in tears as I drove off after telling him something stupid dramatic and extra like ""I'm sorry but this was a mistake, I want to be with Tyler."" It was no mistake, I would play this same game with a few other unassuming guy friends and Tyler would forgive me each time he'd find out, begging me to stay with him all the same. Later on I would get quite adept at ensuring he would not find out. I would routinely excuse my behaviour, assuring myself that this relationship didnt really matter, his feelings wouldnt matter, he would recover. This relationship was a placeholder, for when I finally get to be with Daniel again. (Of course, this mental gymnastic routine would never be deployed whenever Tyler made mistakes or hurt me) I would reassure myself that it would be a perfect relationship with Daniel, he wouldnt treat me like this, he would be perfect for me. Daniel was the one who got away, albeit two, three years ago at this point, who will absolutely come back. Tyler and I would continue to fight, to hurt, and to pretend that nothing is wrong for the sake of saving face. We were both the frog and I, my inability to control my emotions and urges alongside my reluctance to go to therapy, was the boiling water that was killing us. It was destroying him absolutely moreso. By the time we graduated high school at 18, I had torn down his confidence and self assurance to the point that he was almost a broken down shell of the human being he was when we met. We were still together when we were both accepted into an excellent program at the very prestigious university conveniently situated at the centre of town. There were five-ish high schools in the nearby area and almost all of the high achieving regional school leavers would be in the next year's first year intake. Daniel was one of them. In a way, the remnants of my sane mind at the time knew it was a bit of a tall order to assume I would accidentally encounter Daniel again in such a big state. I proved the last of those rational brain cells wrong when I ran into Daniel in class halfway through the school year. I couldnt believe it was him, I was shocked and elated. He had grown much, much taller, his voice was deep and his once curly brown hair was now a black-brown in messy waves around a very serious face. He spoke very softly and never minced words when we caught up over the three years we had lost contact. He was on a full scholarship, halfway through his freshman year already with an internship at an impressive firm. The characteristic modern knight in shining armour. I couldnt fault him; on the surface he was inch by inch, word for word, the ideal I had fabricated. Turns out, he missed me too. He had kept all the notes, the letters, the photos. He had never developed feelings for anyone after me, let alone even considered dating. It was a FP dream come true. I broke it off with Tyler without hesitation on my part. It had seemed screaming like a banshee and holding a cleaving knife to my neck was the only means of communicating let me get into my car so I can leave he was capable of understanding. I would later tell many versions of this breakup story, some of my friends think he was the one with the knife, some think it was pointed at me, most think we broke it off long before Daniel. I have told so many versions of this same story that the only bit of information reminding me of the real sequence of events is the police report he filed. To cut the waffling short and to save the trouble of repeating almost the EXACT same story of manipulation, verbal abuse and paranoia again unless anyone is honestly still interested, I am 21 now and Daniel and I have been together for 3 years. I have cheated on him over the entirety of this time and he is more obsessed with me now than I was with him when I was 16. I still sleep around with Tyler (who never really let me go), Adam, Adam's girlfriend, work 'friends' married or not, Tyler's best friend, Daniel's best friend and other physical almost-replicas of Daniel who can give me the level of affirmation and attention I want when Daniel isnt around. Im absolutely getting bored of Daniel, his FP pedestal is all but revoked. Ive been sleeping around with a new guy, a new FP, Brendan, who is in every way as inexperienced as Tyler and Daniel were before I emotionally ripped them to pieces. Im going to a psychiatrist for the first time tomorrow, Ive got every Wednesday night booked for the next four weeks. Theres no resolution to this story, please dont wait five years to start therapy. If you feel like youre an awful person, you probably are and no amount of mental gymnastics or internet enablers can erase all the things that youve done. Im no mastermind villain for hurting people and getting away with it, Im just the psycho ex people tell funny stories about to their next girlfriend. "
152,vulnerability,BPD,Posted on Facebook about mental health to sensitize my friends and acquaintances... and the response was amazing!,6,8lj7k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/8lj7k0/posted_on_facebook_about_mental_health_to/,2018-05-23 23:07:52,"So I thought I'd share with you guys what I wrote. :\) In May of last year, I had vowed that I would give myself 12 months to see if I could turn my life around. If time ran out and no change seemed to be possible, I had a detailed plan to commit suicide. Obviously, I lived to tell the tale and have gleefully turned the page. I know what some of you might be thinking. ""\*cringe\* Why is she sharing this on Facebook?! Bad vibez, ergh."" Yeah well, it's exactly for that reason that I'm mustering up the courage to post this. Not for attention seeking, or validation, but because the stigma surrounding mental health is still dangerously present in today's society, and I have felt it firsthand. What has inspired me to do so is the [#metoo](URL campaign, where victims of rape decided to speak up. What was once a shameful secret is now an empowering story, told to signal that no one has to silently live with their pain. I think a similar sensitization should happen concerning mental health issues. Whereas so many still perceive asking for help as a sign of weakness, I see strength in admitting our deficiencies and seeking for lasting change. To some, crying and worrying should be done in private, as it makes them uncomfortable, but to me, it is such a beautiful demonstration of trust and vulnerability to share these feelings with someone. What is called by some a defect, is really just a wound that needs to heal. Admitting that you're not okay may seem like attention whoring, but it's simply being honest and not putting on a mask that cuts any possibility of real connection with the rest of the world. We aren't taught what fostering emotional intelligence entails. It is simply not part of our culture. We are encouraged to strive, perform, grow externally, but not to connect, communicate, and grow internally. Our society is facing an epidemic of debilitating loneliness, depression, anxiety, dependencies and stress\-related health issues. By age 40, about 50&amp;#37; of the Canadian population will have or have had a mental illness. And that's not counting those who haven't told a soul about it. Not surprising, when bottling things up to save face has been the way to go for many of us. Sensitivity is only a weakness when one doesn't know how to use it. I truly believe that by being more attuned to our emotions and other's, deep healing will be possible at a large scale. I was fortunately able to ask for the help and support that I needed, but I'm painfully aware that not everyone is this lucky. So next time you shy away from a ""heavy"" conversation because you feel uncomfortable or don't know what to say, just remember that what every human being needs is pretty darn simple : to be seen, to be heard. It's the thought that counts. The rest is just brownie points. So yeah, please learn to take care of yourself, and others. This self\-care movement needs to grow tenfold, and I wanted to contribute to that by sharing my experience. And above all, don't feel bad for me. This is a testimony of light, not darkness. People need to understand that it's okay to go through this and be open about it. Wether it's a counsellor at school, a psychologist, a friend, a lover, a family member, reach out. Maybe not to a complete stranger in the street though, that could be a little weird. We're not there \*just\* yet. Thanks for reading. \&lt;3 Share if you want, made it public.

The outer shell I have is tough, rock solid, I have attitude and I'm crazy, I'm extreme and I don't care about anyone. I'm flirtatious, I use people, I manipulate. I care about the way I look so much that eating really isn't in my life and going out without makeup? Yeah right. I'm already killing myself over not working out these past two days. Anyways, the inside of me is very vulnerable and extremely insecure and sick, very ill. It's the vulnerability I have when I'm disassociating. I'm awkward, quiet and I don't fit in at all. And that person comes out when I meet someone I genuinely care about or learn to care about or when I'm extremely nervous. It's so much better to be a cold alter ego than that person inside me. I rather be tough and hard to get to know than insecure and too genuine. But sometimes I catch myself slipping and showing my insides and I never want to show that, ever. There's been so many awkward situations I've been in that I've made embarrassingly awkward because I'm shy and insecure and I repeat those situations so much in my head, even though they're from years ago, I repeat them until I feel sick.

For example, I am reluctant to continue a friendship with someone else because it makes me feel inferior/shame about myself. Its not really in the way that the persons way of interacting with me makes me feel bad about myself, in the sense that its crossing boundaries, but then I guess you could say that too. I cant bring myself to really care for the person because their vulnerability makes me feel like Im inferior too, even though it shouldnt. Like I guess its another way of saying your vulnerability only matters if I already liked you in the first place. I know this makes me a bad friend, and possibly why Im not that good at sustaining various long term friendships with other people. Can anyone relate to this?

I can't stop the thoughts: that hes avoiding me, that hes tired of me, that he doesn't really like me and doesn't know how to say it, but worst of all that maybe hes cheating or loves someone else more. It hurts. It hurts to feel like you're being cheated on almost as much as the real thing, because in your mind it *is* happening. And i don't know how to stop it. Every day in my mind, hes gone behind my back and hurt me, even though deep down i know its not true.

157,vulnerability,BPD,"I was researching various medical literature on BPD, especially studies utilizing the Dimensional Model for PDs. Almost universally they identified three subtypes. Figured that I would share some of the consistent conclusions.",6,7vacfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/7vacfc/i_was_researching_various_medical_literature_on/,2018-02-05 09:56:47,"Just got context there are not universal names for these subtypes that these studies have identified, so in the purpose of clarity I'm just going to reference them by the most common and self-explanatory names. Also there has been older studies done that have identified the same three subtypes, although what is more interesting is that the newer studies utilizing the ""Dimensional Model"" for Personality Disorders has identified the same three subtypes. These subtypes are (labeled by their most frequent names): * ""Pure"" or ""Core"" BPD: exhibits more of the basic BPD features, usually with increased severity in the purely Bordeline symptoms than the other subtypes, however lacks traits of other Personality Disorders. This subtype mostly reported the most severity of symptoms, although they reported inconsistently on patterns of avoidant-attachment or attachment-anxiety, indicating a disorganized attachment style. Also a high need for intimacy with contradictory anxiety when experiencing intimacy. * ""Extravert/Externalizing"" aka ""Anti-social/Narcissistic"" BPD: exhibits an outward-oriented/externalizing attitude seemed to be a common denominator in the narcissistic, antisocial, and histrionic PD dimensions on which this subtype differentiated from the other two subtypes. Patients of this subtype reported relatively low symptomatic severity and generally more adaptive levels of personality functioning, with their interpersonal functioning being characterized by a dominant, self-centered style. It could be hypothesized that these externalizing patients have a tendency to deny distress, however these patients have problems adjusting to social norms, as a result of their externalizing style. This was confirmed by impairments on domains of responsibility and social concordance. This subtype is often known for their high levels of dismissive attachment and indeed scored higher on attachment avoidance compared to the other subtypes. Men were overrepresented in this subtype, which might indicate a gendered expression of BPD pathology, marked by a tendency for men to externalize problems. This subtype's expression of traits of NPD and AsPD make them particularly treatment-resistant. * ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" BPD: labeled as such because of the elevated levels of schizotypal and, to lesser extent, paranoid features that were evident. This group seems to be more prone to the psychotic symptoms that were noted in previous editions of the DSM as part of the diagnostic criteria for BPD. This subtype seems to be at least slightly more at risk of developing Psychosis than the other subtypes. This subtype seems to resemble the the ICD-10 diagnosis of Pseudo-neurotic Schizophrenia, however this subtype of BPD can be differentiated by having more intact perceptual processes and less vulnerability to fully psychotic states (although transient, reversible psychotic regressions may be present in patients of this subtype). The fact that similar symptoms (such as psychotic manifestations) may be different in nature and duration when occurring in the context of borderline pathology versus schizotypal pathology underlines the need for specific adaptations of the standard treatments. Interesting tidbits: * The subtypes were markedly gendered. Around 75% of male Borderlines were found to fit into the ""Extravert/Externalizing"" subtype, 20% in the ""Core"" subtype, and only 5% in the ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" subtype. Around 65% of female Borderlines were found to fit into the ""Core"" subtype, 25% in the ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" subtype, and 10% in the ""Extrovert/Externalizing"" subtype. * There is a very strong correlation between subtypes and their long-term quality of life and outcomes. The ""Extravert/Externalizing"" subtype was found to measure significantly higher in their long-term quality of life, with the ""Core"" subtype with the second highest outcome, and the ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" subtype having the lowest outcome. * Also a strong correlation was found between subtypes and comorbid symptoms/Axis-1 Disorders. The ""Extrovert/Externalizing"" subtype comes up with the fewest comorbid disorders, with the ""Core"" subtype in second, and the ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" subtype in third. * Relevant trends were found in correlation between the subtypes and their severity of interpersonal problems, affective (mood) dysregulation, as well as identity problems. Once again the ""Extrovert/Externalizing"" subtype showed the least amount of problems in these areas, with the ""Schizotypal/Paranoid"" subtype in second, and the ""Core"" subtype in third."

Things haven't always been entirely platonic between us but for some reason a relationship has never happened. Things are just never stable between us and we can't seem to have a normal day together without someone getting upset or angry (mainly him). One thing that's really starting to bug me is how he constantly tries to make me jealous by lying about the attention he gets from other girls. Recently he'd been so distant from me. Like, I hadn't heard anything from him for weeks and I was starting to think he had no interest in me at all. So I ended up calling him and asking how he'd been. He told me he'd just been busy, and then started talking about this girl he'd been hanging out with. He told me how she'd been ""all over him"" and she'd left her ex-boyfriend to be with him. When I asked what happened between them, he replied ""nothing, she's not my type"". I didn't show any kind of reaction. Then later on I found out this girl was still with her boyfriend and she'd been away for the last two weeks, so they couldn't have been hanging out. So he's been lying to me to make me jealous, but I really don't understand why. He hasn't been in touch for weeks and I'm the one who is asking after him, yet he is trying to get some kind of reaction out of me. What for? It reminds me of times in the past where he'd constantly be bragging about how many girls he'd been speaking with on Tinder in front of me. Later on he admitted he said it all to make me jealous because he had feelings for me. But I don't buy that excuse anymore. If he genuinely liked me, he'd have just asked me out by now surely? The last time I spoke with him, he called me up asking if he could come over. He said he was really excited to see me and had this whole day planned. He had a list of movies he wanted us to watch together. He even hinted at wanting to stay over in my bed and he kept saying how happy he was to have him in his life. When he came round everything started off fine, but then I got this email from a job I'd applied for and really wanted. It was a rejection email and I was visibly upset. He seemed to be annoyed at me for being upset because the day was no longer revolving around his plans. Eventually he told me he wanted to go home and I pleaded with him to stay, saying I could really do with his support but he didn't want to. I even said he could stay over but he didn't seem interested anymore. So now I'm left feeling really rejected and humiliated.

Im really proud of how independent I've learned to be. It's actually my biggest source of happiness right now, feeling productive, ending toxic coping mechanisms and starting healthy habits. Plus I'm in the city of my dreams. But I'm incredibly lonely. At first it was by choice, starting from before I left. I got tired of depending my happiness on the validation of others. Anyways, I don't talk to anyone back home anymore. Except for my best friend but even then it's hard for me to actually open up to her. And I've made new friends but the more I see them the more I feel like it's pointless to be around them. We smoke weed and talk but it doesn't exactly make me happy. Everything is so pointless...Tbh, I just want someone I can feel myself with, who on top of that, supports and cares for me (and have their ACTIONS reflect that). But I also dislike socializing and it's become harder for me, so I feel like I'm just stuck this way too. Even if I got past that, i make it hard on myself to form relationships bc I'm scared of them abandoning me. I hate vulnerability and as much as I hide it, i become very self aware and i end up with a lower self esteem. I feel completely unwanted. As much as I've learned to adore who I am, a lot of people don't get me. Anyways, I've felt lonely for a long time now but it wasn't until tonight that I really FELT it. I even contemplated self harm, which I haven't in a long time. Idk what to do."

The words don't flow well as poetry because I can't communicate the emphasis I'm placing on certain words and how it's sung. I don't like the first line and will rewrite it. The refrain is not poetic enough and a bit cheesy but I can't find a poetic way to communicate the thought (that she wanted me to love her without risking the vulnerability of actually getting close to me). The word lesbian is not neccesarily a reference to sexual orientation, but can be taken as saying the person is unable to love or open up to men but can maybe do so with women, or as simply a rejection of male love altogether. But it can also be taken literally because I think some women do become lesbians because they get sick of men (or ""fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas"" as Kendrick would say). The last verse doesn't flow and is not poetic enough, but I like it, particularly the last line. Anywho, here it is: A call to arms to cut it off. The writings on the wall. The memories connecting here in deja vu and vertigo. I'm vulnerable, it's time for you to go A lesbian, I've always been.

Since I can remember, it's always been a bit tumultuous in my house. I dont remember much from growing up, but what I do remember is my father. He used to get mad a lot at my mother, and at us. He has issues controlling his anger, and is often incredibly paranoid about my mothers faithfulness to him. I remember him punching holes through walls in anger, threatening time and time again to leave us all because that ""must be what we all want"". I used to think this was normal. Which is CRAZY because it's honestly kinda fucked when you think about it. The man who is supposed to be your protector constantly threatening to leave you for the sake of having us beg him to stay (sound familiar? Lol. Maybe I'm more like my dad than I thought). But that's not the part of it all that bothers me. The one that keeps playing heavily through my head happened when I was 13. I had been diagnosed with severe GAD after almost two years of extreme phobias and panic attacks. During these panic attacks, my parents (mostly my dad) would hold me down, and slap my face to ""bring me back to reality"" as they claimed. When in therapy at some point that year, I was asked how my parents helped me through the panic and I told them exactly that. Because it did seem normal. I was acting crazy, unaware of reality, and the slap would bring me back. But apparently that's not cool in the eyes of a professional? So she ended up calling CPS. Instead of doing anything, or talking to me about it. In my time of vulnerability my parents packed a suitcase and drove me to my grandparents house where I stayed until the social worker came to our house. I felt like I had lost the support of my parents then. And from that moment I learned to shove everything down, for the sake of keeping my family together, and for fear of being shunned again. I don't know. Maybe this is a late night rant. Maybe this is me trying to sort out the nature of my childhood. Maybe I'm wondering if I am this way because of my dad. Who knows? What are your opinions on this? Was this normal? Did anybody go through anything similar? "

164,vulnerability,BPD,How Running Changed My Life,16,6sb5sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/6sb5sb/how_running_changed_my_life/,2017-08-08 14:24:53,"***Its hard to run almost every day and not have your shit together.*** #[Video](URL I'm going to explain some physical and cognitive benefits, but first of all let me explain how a simple jog most days improved so much of my life. I was always into lifting weights and I saw as cardio as something which just opposed this. I was wrong. **Running is meditative,** it's peaceful and once you break through the uncomfortable pain of starting, the pain begins to become a pleasure which is rewarding on so many levels. Modern humans and our immediate ancestor Homo Erectus have several adaptations which make us incredible long-distance runners. With long, springy tendons in our legs and feet, like large elastics, we store and release energy with each running stride. The endurance running hypothesis tells us that humans would chase an animal for 5-10 miles until it died from heat stroke. However, take this with a grain of salt if youre going to make the claim that we evolved to run long distances. Fossil records make it very clear for much of our history we would sprint, climb and crawl to scavenge. 5-10 miles per day runs an irrational risk of depleting glycogen levels and without a kill falling victim to predation through the vulnerability of fatigue A study done at the University of British Columbia found that **regular aerobic exercise increases the size of the hippocampus.** The hippocampus is an area of the brain responsible for **verbal memory and learning.** If I run in the morning I feel sharper, I experience clarity and Im much more focused. Additionally, researchers found resistance, anaerobic training did not have the same cognitive result. Lifting weights are great, you build muscle, it takes discipline and theres the obvious aesthetic appeal, however, too many of us seem to categorise types of exercises as being mutually exclusive and so we miss out on certain benefits. **The ancient Greeks when training for war would exercise the entire body  this is a principle that many later ancient Greek athletes swore by.** For the best results for your well-being, ***combine yoga, weights, callisthenics, Qi Gong, running, basketball and dont become compliant with only one form of exercise.*** Sure, focus on one, but dont see cardiovascular and strength training and being exclusive and incompatible, the truth is they are synergistic. **Burn calories, not time.** Listen to a podcast while you run, or no music at all and listen to your breathing. Turn running into a chance not only to exercise for the sake of exercising but to meditate alone. Empirical evidence suggests the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal cortex have greater volumes in people who exercise. Running on a regular basis will allow new blood vessels in the brain to develop and even increase the rate of success for the survival of the birth of brain cells. Cardiovascular exercise will also reduce insulin resistance, inflammation and stimulate various growth factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor or BDNF is a protein is a protein encoded by the BDNF gene. This protein regulates neuroplasticity and the survival of cells in the brain. BDNF also increases when you periodically fast as well as in those who take anti-depressants. **Running is our natural medicine.** If youre making a decision about what exercise to do in order to lose weight, forget about it  this essentially comes down to your diet. **Focus on nutrition for your body composition; exercise for discipline.** Some great ways to ensure you make the most of the running is to apply some principles from the ancient world. The Stoic meditation of negative visualisation is useful. Before each run or exercise, envision the worst case scenario; injury, tripping and falling, do this in order to never be disappointed and to relieve yourself from placing satisfaction on surpassing some arbitrary number. Set a goal for your run, but never attach your satisfaction on this goal, instead be satisfied with the fact that your attempt is what is worthy. **TL;DR:** *Incorporate some running into your daily routine. You wont lose gains, you'll just become clearer, have more intent and live longer.*"

I don't feel like sharing my story again. Nothing bad has happened between the man and I, but the guy I'm seeing wants to have a ""come-to-Jesus"" talk about where this new relationship is/isn't going, esp. since he has two kids and I have said in the past that I don't want them. And it's true, in the past, I have said that and do say that, but it's so nuanced. I had a very abusive stepmother and in general fucked up childhood, and I'm afraid I'd be like her - I'm afraid I'd screw them up. I wasn't always this stable - that has played a HUGE factor in my decision, but I'm getting older and I'm more on the fence watching my friends settle down and start families - I'm a bit more open minded. Today, for the most part, I think I'm in recovery. This whole thing is pretty triggering. Plus, baby mama had her drama and didn't sound the most stable, so do his kids need to be at risk of another roller coaster female in their lives? He keeps stressing how he is ""straightforward, and open and honest"" and would rather know about things NOW then discover them later. And you know what, human-to-human, I totally get that. He was very upfront and is extremely open with the fact that he has Aspergers. I feel SHITTY not disclosing my BPD. ...but... I've come out with BPD before in the past, some positive experiences, some NEGATIVE experiences. He thinks I have an issue with vulnerability, and he's right - telling people has backfired before. Opening up and being completely vulnerable has led to some excruciatingly painful experiences later which has taken me months, sometimes YEARS to get over. Plus, we're coworkers, so there's an inherent risk that if this goes wrong, my coworkers could find out (and I work in social work, a field, unfortunately, that still stigmatizes borderlines). I want to be open, but it's so new that I don't feel ready yet...I don't know if he's safe yet. But I feel a moral obligation to say something. It feels wrong not to. Give me some good stories, guys. I'm catastrophizing. I am scared outta my mind."

Sorry if it's confusing; I'm struggling lately to get my thoughts down on paper and make sense of this mess in my head lately. After a couple weeks of doing a pretty good job feeling self sufficient and productive, I'm really feeling really needy and depressed today. It feels like I can go weeks without understanding my own emotions or distorted thoughts, and feeling like I don't ""need"" anyone until it's too late and i feel abandoned and sad. It takes so much time and effort. But if I don't, well...lately I've become a person that I just don't recognize: meaner, more abrasive, harsher. It's scaring me, and I think it's because I'm so disconnected from my emotions, other people and (sorry for the cheesiness), but love in my life. Sometimes I don't know how to love people correctly. Of course, I feel joy at the prospect of making more friends and forming connections. But it requires a level of vulnerability or openness I just can't muster lately. I feel too afraid, in part because I'm afraid of being needy and immature. I'm very sad because I feel worthless and no one cares right now. Sometimes I spend hours researching articles and trying to understand where these emotions are coming from. But they are there. I can't just pretend that I don't feel worthless. The other problem is no one has actually called me needy before, except a therapist I saw a few months back, which hurt a lot. Ever since I've just not reached out much and it feels so lonely. But if I reach out and things go wrong, it hurts badly too. I feel angry that a lot of this has to do with my upbringing. My therapist said that it goes back to early childhood. When I finally approached my parents about how I felt as a child, they just said that ""every family is dysfunctional."" My mom actually did hug me, but I'm pissed. You can fix that by giving me the hug you should've given as a kid? Because of how she treated me as a child, I now look back and see and remember a sad lonely child. I was so obedient; always doing the right thing. She abused that in me and took it for granted. I'm hurt that I dont have the same capacity for connection, authenticity, likability as others, because I'm terrified of them and always have been. I'm hurt that others perceive me as aloof even though I want nothing more than a better connection. Tl/dr- what do you do on ""needy"" days when you're alone but you can feel that urge to have someone to connect with and talk to? My husband is out with our friends, but they're mostly guys and especially don't want to be around someone who is emotionally vulnerable at this time."
168,vulnerability,BPD,Why don't I think about how my brother and cousin bullied me ever?,1,62fod1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/62fod1/why_dont_i_think_about_how_my_brother_and_cousin/,2017-03-31 05:07:17,"It's a part of my childhood that I don't want to process for some reason. But I can remember my brother doing shit like pinning me down and kneeling on my shoulders and tapping my chest with his knuckle (it was like torture, all i could do was flail my legs about but once he had a knee on each shoulder, I couldn't do shit). i also remember my cousin being verbally abusive and quite passive aggressive. At some point, I remember the two of them, and the girl next door, sort of forming a group and excluding me and my cousin from it (there is a lot more to this story and weird shit was going on between my cousin and the girl next door and my brother). Me and my cousin were both bullied and sort of turned against eachother. I've always felt bad about being a shitty cousin to him actually. He stayed with us when I was in full hermit mode and I dind't talk to him much because I hated having any change to the stable and non-triggering environment I had created for myself. I can remember that trying to complain to my parents was pointless because I was the ""bad child"" and he was the golden child. I actually remember being punished for doing almost nothing while he could do shit like that to me (he had other forms of physical bullying but the knee-shoulder chest tap was the worst) and never got punished. I don't remember him ever being in trouble actually and I was always in fucking trouble, and it honestly wasn't my fault a lot of the time because my mother would start drama, or make up a crazy rule and then punish me when I defended myself (reason I'm good at arguing even if I didnt argue with people unless I was drunk for a long time. My parents always said I'd make a good lawyer). I think about my childhood a lot but I don't think about that pain for some reason. Is it possible I processed that during my childhood, or is it another unprocessed set of memories and emotions that guides me subconsciously? I don't even remember ever telling anyone outside my family about any of this shit and I remember my friends also assumed I was the bad kid in the family (I was tough to deal with for a while but had my life destroyed and then received 0 empathy, and was actually blamed by my family for every emotional reaction) Maybe it's because it's a standard type of pain. It's natural for older siblings to bully younger siblings. Or maybe this was exactly how I handled being harassed and bullied two years ago, not communicating to anyone outside my family and having my family completely invalidate me about it, and now I' m finally expressing the pain of my childhood as well as the pain of the situation that caused me to re-experience my childhood. There's a lot more shit to the whole fucked up situation that happened when my cousins family came to live with us when I was little. I don't think I could process how the girl next door had been so overtly sexual with me and I didn't know what to do, and then I remember being weirded out by how her and my (older) cousin were towards eachother (just going for it when she used to sit on my lap and arch her back and moan lightly would've changed everything but maybe I would've just ended up like a lot of other dudes that I don't wanna be like. Autism is weird. I really didn't know what was going on and had guilt about sex too. Probably because of moving to america and having teachers and sex-ed shit tell me I should wait, and not receiving any advice on women (or anything really) from either parent. But I think I just recently started to think about this shit and how obviously turned on she was and how hot that could've been. Probably TMI, and this isn't a brag because thinking about it causes me nothing but pain now) I was wondering if this couldve been a reason that my brother was drawn to another girl I had a crush on for a long time. I think weird stuff happened with this girl and my cousin and brother and they all knew that she wanted me first. I believe it's not just things that are done to you that are traumatizing, but things you do to others. Anytime you can't process the feelings of a situation, you've been traumatized IMO. So maybe that was part of the reason my brother made me feel guilty for not wanting him to date my former best friend (saying he didn't see why it would bother me) and love interest (a girl that later tried with me but I ran away). Then I said they could date because he was really lonely and we were at a party and he was not aggressive enough with a blonde girl and then got really angry the next day and seemed really depressed and I kinda said he could date this girl on a whim (I had already had to walk in on them making out at a july 4th party at my house and I just went numb emotionally) I was thinking that this might be where my paranoia about any girl I like sleeping with people I know comes from. And I wonder if I would try to subconsciously bring about a repetition of the trauma. this girl then tried to sleep with a lot of my friends (I think i was unconsciously punishing her by not showing interest but I didn't feel attracted to her after all that), and I suspect she did sleep with quite a few of them. She was definitely BPD looking back but I didn't even know what that was back then. I can also remember going to the city one night and she was trying to dance with me (I was dancing with one of her friends) and she freaked out and then hooked up with one of my friends roommates. Then she waited until the rest of us went back to his place to drive home and she initiated sex again, which I heard (for some reason I really didn't care). But the friend told me that she had initiated the sex after we all came in, so I think it was to get back at me. I'm rambling and this is stream of consciousness and I don't know what point I'm trying to make because I veered off subject. But it appears that there are some men that are drawn to repeat the trauma of missing out on opportunities and then having that person get with, or date, someone they like. And that a lot of BPD women are maybe compelled to repeat traumas in different ways. Or maybe it's just a very poor, and spiteful, coping mechanism that some women have developed, that a specific type of man always becomes the target of. I believe doing this to someone is traumatizing for the woman too though and that it's a pattern of behavior that will make everyone hate you. That might sound harsh, but it's the truth. I think a better idea would be to change course and risk vulnerability and sexual rejection with closed off men. I would argue that if you've picked up sexual signals, the likelihood of being rejected would be very low anyway These men show signals in different ways. I could not be sexual with women without feeling overwhelmed with guilt and wanting to apologize. So, I would show it by being nice, by trying to talk to people, basically everything but hinting at sex or sending normal signals. Not exactly attractive to someone used to having guys be aggressive. But i would argue that the inverse, being the aggressor, would be a very big turn on as well. It is important that you do this in private though. As in, if you're at a party, try to get them a lone before you make a move. I could never even try to hit on girls in front of people without getting very flustered. I would ignore all signals from women unless we were alone too. And most of these men are the same. If they're like me, they'll be very open to advice and sort of enjoy having a girl coach them into being sexual. Once you've gotten them comfortable being sexual, you can even start teaching them some moves and shit. And eventually you can probably even bring an aggressive side out of them. I believe men like this are usually very open to advice, criticism and are open to anything once you unleash the sexual beast. I should've made two posts but all of this shit is kind of tied together. I'm writing this because I think there's a certain type of man that cluster b girls adore and vice-versa and they're the ones getting hurt the most because of dynamics that I don't think anyone who hasnt been through it could figure out. It's really tragic. Remember that these men would also rather be someone you slept with and then freaked out on than to never know what it would've been like. I hope this helps because I've seen this shit happen before. Kanye and taylor would be the biggest example because I have no doubt that taylor wanted to get with kanye before he turned into a huge asshole and that 808s was inspired by taylor, kim, and a bunch of other cluster b girls that couldn't understand why kanye was the way he was and probably did this shit to him. I believe my beautiful dark twisted fantasy was a reaction to this because kanye probably figured he got rejected for not being enough of an asshole, instead of because he was oblivious. ALso, look how taylor reacted to the recent ""famous"" controversy, by posting pictures with, and probably sleeping with, Drake. Most people can't comprehend why he was trashing drake at one of his shows during psychosis but I would feel very betrayed if I changed music forever and then had a bunch of people turn on me too. But Kanye did also bring it on himself by acting the way he did. But going in the complete opposite direction is not right either, as you can see with kanye and jay-z, who I believe were both shy and reserved as children and became boastful and arrogant. One is psychotic and out of his mind the other is a businessman and a sellout, who pretends to be kanyes best friend but never takes his side on anything (while simultaneously totally ripping off his sound and then leaving him to be socially crucified by most of america). Jay-z is also image obsessed, whereas kanye does not give a fuck (but has gone mad to the point of not even being coherent anymore) Also, kanye was trying to make a statement about white bias at the grammys when he stood up for beyonce, and was also defending jay-z's wife. Something jay-z was too cowardly to do."

I've fallen in love with someone that makes me feel so high and so low at the same time. Its not like he does anything obviously manipulative. But we both have bpd and sometimes it feels like he uses what he knows about the disorder against me, to fuck with my head and gain power. Like telling me about his friends that are girls (or his ex) randomly in conversation. He knows this bothers me but he also knows that if I act on my feelings he can claim that im insecure (which is obviously true but im working on it in therapy). He knows that I know this so my only choice is to act on it and look crazy or keep it bottled inside and pretend everything is fine. He knows I don't like to show vulnerability even though i tend to out of nature. Also when he just plain stops talking to me in the middle of a conversation, I feel as if he's saying, ""We are done talking now. We will only continue when I deem this conversation worthy."" Our relationship is already so controlled by him, I feel like. He knows i love him but he claims he is unable to commit fully (by this I literally only mean the difference of a label, we have everything else a normal relationship would have, including monogamy) due to the past trauma of his relationships. Now I know this all sounds crazy but we've had in depth conversations about our manipulative tendencies and I feel like im playing this game with him. I feel like the only way to get out is to just drop him but he's my FP now... I've truly fucked myself. Just typing this I've realized I can only continue to feel crazy or leave him behind. Im so afraid I'm just being paranoid and all of this is nonsense and I'm just screwing up what is mostly a pleasant relationship. I really do care about him but I'm afraid.

Then last December she told me her and her boyfriend split, so of course, I tried to be a good support for her through the break up and gave her encouragement and stuff, thinking she'd get back on her feet and be the kind of girl she was. But pretty much for the past 5 months, hanging out with her has been super frustrating and I kind of hate it. She only talks about herself, and her problems and she talks a lot. She doesn't stop talking. But she shows hardly any interest in me. She always brings up her ex, she seems obsessed with him even though she claims to be over him. She's also come to me with a lot of other personal problems that I can't really deal with, like weird stories about her strict parents, her other friends, other people, her college, she's made herself into this perfect victim of everything in her life and she loads it all on me. Then when she isn't talking about problems, she only talks about make up and how hot actresses are...like she has nothing really else to say, she doesn't seem to be interested in movies, music and her taste is really poor. Anyway, I don't really want to hang out with her anymore because she's very annoying and makes me edgy but she says weird stuff to me, like thanking me for 'being her best friend' and she says she misses me a lot, and that she's glad she has a friend like me...and I know that she doesn't actually have many other close friends, but at the same time, I think it's because her personality is just really unappealing. She also gets jealous super easily, like if I look nice and we hang out at a bar, she sort of tells me that I look too good and she means it in a nice way but she can't hide that she's also intimidated and then sort of ditches me at parties.. She's also mentioned how she's been ditched by friends in the past, and her ex and she holds grudges and gets really really angry (not at me yet, but I've heard she really blows up at people). She's also mentioned suicide and stuff before pretty casually which made me panic at little in my mind. She's also really naive, like she has an idea of life that a 16 year old would have, like she seems like a teenager and at social events, people kind of back away from her after a few minutes because it's really obvious that she's very immature, and she also talks far too much and doesn't let anyone else hardly speak. I know she has Aspergers because she told me but she has never gone to counselling or got any help for it and doesn't think it really effects her in any way, though it's obvious it does. I'm mixed between feeling sorry for her and her vulnerability and just kind of feeling sick of her and frustrated. I feel oddly tied to her and I get deep messages from her basically making me feel like she relies on me a lot and would be super upset if I was to stop hanging out with her. But I'm tired of being her counselor, I'm sick of her negativity and bored of her immaturity. I just don't know how to get out of this now though...any suggestions? "
171,vulnerability,BPD,My relationship with a borderline girl with multiple personality disorder (or Dissociate disorder as it is now called) among other things.,5,5i2q58,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/5i2q58/my_relationship_with_a_borderline_girl_with/,2016-12-13 20:33:01,"This is a rather long story of my extremely intense relationship with someone with some pretty severe disorders. I just wanted to share it for anyone who is interested in reading about it or has experienced something similar. This girl fell head over heals for me and it took about a week for me to fall seriously in love with her too. Our first date we started sharing our family history and it appeared like our childhood had been similar and our role in our family as well (lost child, caretaker, brother/sister with serious mental issues..) though her history was one of severe trauma and abuse and mine was way less intense. I am an intelligent guy and on our first date we talked for hours at a time. Apparently I was the perfect match for her because I am both a rescuer and incredibly caring, as well as controlling and very controlled. She thought I was like that guy from 50 shades at first and it turned her on immensely. She wanted me to control her, she wanted to give herself over to my control. I go to the gym 6 days a week, meditate, eat healthy, work hard at my passions and study hard. She was the most incredible creature I had ever seen. So free, so emotional, so highly sensitive and in touch with nature and art and everything that is valuable and real in this world, I had never seen anything like it and being with her changed me. She didnt care about money or anything superficial. She is the least superficial person I have ever met. And as I saw her and her inner pain and wanted desperately to help her and be there for her, she wanted the same for me. She was the first one who really saw me and my role in my family as the rock or foundation, the one who was always there and took all the responsibility for other peoples feelings. So we got into an idealizing phase of the relationship and my world revolved around this girl. And her world revolved around me. We spend all day together everyday, she moved in with me very very quickly. I wanted her too and she had no money, no friends, difficult relationship with her parents and brother, hadnt been able to buy new clothes in about 4 years. On the other hand I had a lot of money and a nice home and wanted only to help her. I wanted to save her. We made love the whole day and walked in the woods and cooked together and visited museums. It was a magical time. After about 3 weeks we decided we wanteda to marry and have kids together. This was so intense, she told me in all earnest that if I were to die she would go to and meet me on the other side and she was so calm while saying that. There were trance like states and it felt like balancing on the edge between life and death sometimes. There were tantric type experiences with our clothes on. She was the first one I ever told that I loved that I really meant it from my heart. I was laying with my head on her lap and I said to her that I loved her and I started sobbing uncontrollably. She had opened my heart and was looking down at me with the most loving, motherly eyes I have ever seen. Suddenly I started also feeling all kinds of emotions which I had repressed. I suddenly loved and missed my father, something I had never felt. But immediately things were very strange with this girl. She was very, very afraid right from the start. I remember right at the beginning she looked at me with such intensity and emotion and asked me: will you protect me?. The intensity of it was so great that I felt like I couldnt breath. The responsibility just felt too big to carry. But I said yes. This feeling of deep existential anxiety with her was ever present and she quickly started going through my phone and computer. She needed to know and have a hold on everything in my life. I had looked at nude images of women on reddit (which my previous girlfriend had been fine with) and she had a panic attack because of it because they were prettier than she was. She was insecure about everything, everything. My intelligence, my family, my money, my talents, her body, my sexuality. The insecurity was alarming but she apparently held a lot of it in in the beginning of our relationship and it came spilling out more and more over the months after that first phase of obsessive, desperate love. Later she would say that I sexually abused her because she was so insecure about the fact that I watched porn that she apparently did things that she didnt want to do for me. If she had said she was even the slightest bit uncomfortable with anything I would have immediately backed down and hugged and kissed her and told her I loved her. I was a very, very tender and caring lover and never wanted to do anything that crossed the line. I just wanted her to feel good and to feel loved. But later in the relationship she put me down as her abuser. She said that my ""abuse"" had been worse than her being raped (which she had experienced) because that rapist hadn't loved her while I had also ""abused"" her heart. She talked to me as if I had literally raped her. I am the first she shared everything with. She told me things she had never told anyone before and my therapist says that I was probably the first one she ever felt safe with. Which at the same time meant extremely unsafe. I am the first one with whom she relinquished all control. This made our relationship pattern so extreme because of the intense fear that came after. Immediately things were starting to go downhill with my family. They noticed there was something odd about this girl and didnt like it. I think I noticed her dark side in the beginning as well but was incredibly excited by it at first. It was all so deep and psychological, it fascinated me. Very long story short, she managed to isolate me from my family (it is a very long story so Im not going into this). About 5 months into our relationship she started going into a depression and tried to commit suicide. I know it wasnt a real attempt but at the time I believed it was. I was in the room and she was under the covers swallowing all my sleeping pills. I stopped her, called 911 and after that event a very dark phase began. We didnt leave each-others sight anymore. Literally everything I did that did not involve her was selfish of me. She felt abandoned by everything I did that did not focus on her. I couldnt meditate anymore because it meant abandonment (apparently my energy went inside during meditation and I wasnt with her anymore). Her sexual insecurities went out of control. I had stopped watching porn for her but the fact that I could find other women attractive was impossible for her to cope with. She lay on me with that for hours, days, nights. Becoming hysterical. Eventually I tried all kinds of tantric exercises/routines to couple my sexuality to love and I even thought only about her, never about someone else. I didnt want any other girl than her but yes, I found them attractive sometimes. We had fights about that throughout the days and night. She went hysterical. She threatened suicide, she needed me to be like that guy from The Notebook. I told her that I loved her and that my love wat REAL and REAL LIFE and not from some stupid romantic movie she had watched and cried about a 100 times. In her hysterical moments she tried to hurt me physically, she hit me and she tried to break down my self esteem. And all I did was try to help her, help us. Seek counseling for her, for us. Do yoga, take her to the woods for a walk. Make dinner for us. Go to the petting zoo so she could cuddle some animals for a while, buy clothes for her, give her massages... I did everything and I kissed the ground under her feet. I complimented her on everything, I bought dresses for her and took care of her, took her out to dinner. I treated her like a princes. And it wasnt enough. It was never enough. And all I wanted was to get back to that first phase of love. I wanted 'my girl' back. Meanwhile I was sitting in front of the door, guarding it a lot of nights making sure she couldnt leave and kill herself while she was hysterical and mean and abusive to me. Another part of her personality came up then and I called her Ursula, her face changed and her way of speaking. It was a different person. A person who wanted nothing more than to destroy me. I did not know what Ursula was capable of and I was afraid of her. These hysterical moments would alternate with loving understanding moments and moments of vulnerability and crying that she was sorry like a fragile 6 year old girl. It made it s confusing. Suddenly she was understanding and vulnerable and sorry for everything. Suddenly she could get into my perspective and 'forgive' me. Then at a certain point I was completely empty. I had given everything and was suffering burn out and depression myself after months of this abuse. I had held out so long because I am very good at taking care of myself. Though I had been completely isolated with her, I didn't see friends and family anymore and I couldn't talk to anyone about what was really happening also because I couldn't let go of her. I couldnt handle the fights anymore so I went to my mother and my girlfriend was again completely hysterical, calling me 20 times telling me if I didnt come home she would kill herself and it would all be over. I refused. Then something changed. Suddenly she didnt seem to care anymore. It was like a different person took over A new phase emerged where she was sometimes completely independent of me and started going out and dancing and at other times she was completely dependent and couldnt let my hand go when we walked outside. I was so exhausted and couldnt take it anymore. I was being thrown around emotionally and was obsessed and couldnt sleep anymore. I called my father who lives in America (I live in Europe) and told him how I felt. He bought me a plane ticket and I went there. Of course my girlfriend felt abandoned by me because of this. While the fact is that I gave her *everything* I had and more for months and now I was an empty shell of myself that could barely function and she couldnt be there for me at all. Not even a hug most of the time while I so desperately needed some comfort and consolation. So I went to America and instead of only relaxing there I went into very intensive group and individual therapy and did everything I could. I meditated for 1.5 hours a day. I did yoga, I did affirmations. I read about psychology, I did journalling I realized I had made mistakes and have my own issues and I wanted to work on all of that and I just wanted my girl back. That was all I really wanted. Looking back I still think I made mistakes in my relationship with her and I have been codependent among other things. I still take responsibility for them and do not want to repeat that pattern in future relationships. I have learned. Meanwhile she did nothing of the sort. She just partied and picked up her life again while I was in America. Called me often and I couldnt talk about what I was doing, she was that cold, distant bitch on the phone all the time. Until a point came where I told her I couldnt have contact for a while with her because our contact was very unhealthy for me. Then again things changed. I didnt speak with her for about a week and then she messaged me if it had been long enough. Suddenly she wasnt that distant person anymore but the little girl. She called me at night and wanted me to read her bedtime stories (I always made them up on the spot for her, this one was about a lonely squirrel the size of the moon...). And everything seemed to go well for a time this way with no more fights right up until I was about to leave the States and she told me she had had sex with two other guys while I was gone one of them she had had sex with 3 times in one night and it wasnt bad she told me. I hadn't even masturbated thinking about anyone else but her during my 10 weeks in America. Right at the moment I was really becoming myself again and vibrant and about to leave the loving family with whom I had been staying she hit me with this. It was like a truck hit me in the chest and I was completely confused and obsessed again. I couldn't sleep and I was using too many sleeping pills. She broke up with me right after that, right after I sent her a letter about all the thing *I* was sorry about, and I came back in such agony and pain. I was physically hurting and depressed. But two days after I came back she was suddenly in my bedroom and jumped me to make love. We did and the next day she told me she thought I was a dead end and was completely cold and distant again. This was the new pattern emerged which lasted about 4 months. A pattern of pushing and pulling. Of trying to break down my self esteem. Of rubbing salt in my wounds. Of telling me she wanted to marry me one day and being completely cold and distant the next. Of extreme insecurity still. Of giving me the slightest compliments to keep me hooked while I was kissing the ground on which she stood. I had learned that love means letting go and not controlling the other person so I tried to do everything to just let her be her and let her do and come and go as she wished. She did nothing of the sort for me. Sexual teasing, only having real sex with me when I again found my inner strength a little and didnt need her as much. Then slammng the door shut again. I had planned on getting my life back together when I got back, but this pattern consumed me. I had planned on doing things for myself but I was unable to. I couldn't sleep and this interaction kept me obsessed and only busy with her. Kissing me but never really kissing, just wanting to feel me craving for her real kiss and not giving it to me. She held my on that edge in all ways she knew how. We were casual dating in this phase while she did not want me to see her family and kept me at arms length while at the same time telling me she wanted to have kids with me. She saw how I was suffering sometimes and craving her and she seemed like she was getting energy from it, she really enjoyed it... It all ended when I again rejected her by not picking up my phone because I was crying with my mother in the car, telling her how I felt for the first time in almost two years. I had abandoned my girlfriend of course by not picking up. I had also written her a letter about things that I was upset about. One of them that there was 0 reciprocity in our relationship and that I was hurt. The next day she came to my house and had put on her most beautiful dress and make up and necklace that I loved. She said she was doing well. She sat in front of me and told me Im in love with someone else. A wave of shock went through my body again and I started crying. When saying goodbye I told her that I wished she had a wonderful life and she would find someone who would see her like I had seen her. She said nothing along those lines to me. I had bought presents for her for a Dutch holiday. One of them was a beautiful necklace of a bird. The other was one of those soap bubble things for kids. I had bought that for the 6 year old girl that lived inside of her. I gave it to her and I saw that 6 year old again for a moment. Her eyes went wider and her crying wrinkle disappeared completely, she had the face of a little girl and she was talking in a little girls voice. I had seen that little girl so much and loved her to bits. I was the only one with whom she dared to come out. It was literally a girl of 6. I told that little girl that I had loved her more than anything in the whole world and that I hoped she would find someone who loved her as much as I did. She started sobbing and immediately another part of her personality took over and told me she needed to leave right now. She went away quickly. After that I sat in the car screaming like a wounded animal and gave up. I just gave up after all this time of desperately holding onto her. I let go now for the first time. I started writing about everything that was wrong in our relationship throughout the night. I think I wrote for about 6 hours until morning. And it was like a thick fog started lifting and I suddenly started seeing everything that I didn't want to see before. I became very afraid. It was like I had been living in a cult. A cult of two people. I had nightmares the next night. I also suddenly realized that the art she had made was from deep inside of her. She was a real artist and only made work that really came from inside of her. Sometimes it was so warm and loving. But there were some very, very dark figures she had made recently that were truly truly brilliant, I think she could have easily sold them for 1500-2000 dollars a piece. But now they sent shivers down my spine. I cried because the most loving, sweet girl in the world, the one I was in love with, the one who would catch mosquitos with a towel to not kill them and put them outside. The one who loved s much, too much, had, through so much trauma also become this monster of pure self hatred. I couldnt handle it. I am still crying thinking about it. I blocked her phone and threw out all her pictures, I brought all of her stuff that she had left at my place to her the next day and now its over. I know it probably isnt over for her, this new guy she apparently fell in love with is just like all her previous boyfriends before me. A very, very simple, probably sweet, ordinary guy that doesn't really understand anything about her or see her like I have and that she feels safe with because she can feel in control of him and the relationship. Its all over. So much has happened and this is only a very brief description of the events that took place but I think I have given a good overview of it. Afterwards I looked up borderlines in romantic relationship and there was a long list of behaviors that I realized she had all displayed including alienating me from all who loved me and she was so, so clever about it. She needed to eliminate EVERYTHING from my life that was the least bit threatening to her and I let her. This helped me get out of the what was my fault in this?, did I really do everything wrong? way of thinking about it. I have felt more along the entire scale of human emotions these past 2 years than in the entire previous 25 years of my life I believe. I have learned, I have grown and I am grateful even though I have also been physically, mentally and emotionally abused. I think I will be a stronger person because of this relationship And I realize that I need a lot more therapy and start living my own life myself before starting any new relationship again."
172,vulnerability,BPD,People with BPD have the ability to be the sexiest people alive and here's why..,80,5civak,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/5civak/people_with_bpd_have_the_ability_to_be_the/,2016-11-12 15:28:46,"Ever since I was 16, I was told that I was 'sexy' 'hot' and I never didn't get the guy I wanted. I was also a bit over weight and had acne on my back but those things never seemed to interfere with how I dated. The other thing was, I never needed to hear from anyone else that I was able to attract because I just decided in my head that I was. Ever since I got diagnosed with BPD I started looking it up and what I noticed, along with BPD girls are 'pyschos', was that there was an on going idea that girls with BPD were also super attractive, even more attractive than other girls. There are even questions online like 'Why are girls with BPD so sexy?' or 'Why does it seem that all girls with BPD are attractive?' Then I started reading a book called 'The Art of Seduction' and I couldn't help but notice that a lot of the tips and stories of seduction were things I already had figured out when I was 16. Seduction is manipulation, but not in an evil sense of the word, but in a way that people actually enjoy it. Nobody doesn't like being seduced, people often complain afterwards that they were 'seduced' and that's why they 'cheated' or fell into a relationship or obsession they didn't want, but nobody doesn't enjoy the actual act of seduction or else they wouldn't be seduced in the first place. There are also so many people on the planet who wish they were able to seduce and have such problems talking to the opposite sex that it's holding them back. They might make excellent long term committed partners but they fail desperately at the first stages of a relationship that they never actually get to be partners. The thing about BPD is that we're so naturally complex in ourselves that we are a natural mystery. We are also able to tap into other's emotions and desires so fast that we know what someone else wants and we know how to be that. That's not always great for ourselves and it's how a lot of us lose our identities, but there is a way of balancing that as well. Borderlines are great at seduction because we have the mix of excitement, allure, confidence (at first), and vulnerability. We hate boredom, we crave intensity and intensity is very sexy. Angelina Jolie isn't the sexiest woman in the world for nothing, she's the sexiest because she's intense, complex and isn't afraid of showing she enjoys sex. Everything she does and says she does with passion. She exudes mystery, complexity and adventure. Borderlines are fascinating to others because we appear to have escaped the real world and gone into a fantasy world in our minds which we like to act out in reality. We are literally, out of this world. We desire in us a life of thrills, great perfect love, and meaning. We are in general, never satisfied with normality. Also, when we love, we love with a huge amount of raw passion and emotion that most other people don't really understand. I have never been loved by a borderline, but I imagine it would be a crazy yet thrilling experience....that would also probably leave me heart broken at the end in some way. I can imagine it begins where you are literally someone's ideal person, the greatest person they have ever met, their dream in every way, their hero or princess, like no one they have ever met before...and that would be pretty intense but also, quite exciting. They want to know everything about you and everything about you is fascinating to them. And if that borderline happens to also be quite physically attractive, then it would be the best thing ever. Like if Brad Pitt suddenly fancied me that much, I think I'd be on cloud 9 for sure. And it's sexy when someone you want wants you, and wants you that much that you're the greatest thing that ever lived on the planet. And it's not even cheesy coming from them, because you can tell that they mean it, and they do. They talk in a way you've never heard before, they say things that no one says and they don't do small talk. They dive right in to ideas and fantasies for their future. They are often creative in some way or have a great enjoyment of the arts or music. They are romantic, they act like they're from a movie but it seems so natural to them. They're impulsive, a date with them is never dull. The sex with them is like fireworks, they don't hold back, they don't act shy. In short, they're intoxicating. Borderlines are exciting to be with, we are generally funny or intelligent or super affectionate and loving and when we smile when we're happy we light up the room because no amount of ecstasy can compare to our feelings at that moment. And we're quirky, we don't fit in or go with the tide. We're the people who write the most romantic love letters when no one even writes love letters anymore. We're the kind that love to have sex because it is one of the ways we connect to people especially the person we love and when we have sex, we generally do it intensely too. We're the people who cry and have a vulnerable side that comes out more frequently than with others, we show our weaknesses and that also creates connection and our lovers respond to that with tenderness as we cry in their arms about something they can't understand. We lavish them with attention, text after text even though it annoys them at times, it also reminds them of their importance to us. And everyone yearns to be important, to everyone or just to someone. They want to be seen, heard and valued and borderlines do that with our lovers when we're in love. They are told that they will never be replaced, never be left, they're the greatest, the sexiest...and the borderline means it too.... And then the end, when a borderline starts to lose that infatuation and starts to see their partner a bit more clearly, maybe even starts to get the attention of someone else who might be more appealing to them, the borderline leaves. A sorry goodbye and I hope you have a great future and then they go to someone else and then the new ex sees them out and happy with this new person and their heart breaks into a million pieces. Because no one can break hearts accidentally as well as a borderline can! Elizabeth Taylor didn't have 8 marriages for no reason and other notable BPD women include Marilyn Monroe, Amy Winehouse, Angelina Jolie, Britney Spears, Audrey Hepburn, Brigitte Bardot... all of whom never really managed well with relationships but were renowned for their attractiveness and sex appeal. So, the mystery about why borderlines have often been the most alluring people in the planet is because of our intensity and our idealism and our craving for love. The thing is, we don't even do it on purpose. We don't scheme, we don't think it through like a pick up artist or a psychopath. We just embody seduction naturally. It's one of the most interesting parts of this disorder to me, because it's been a key part of myself for nearly my whole life. I've been able to charm people without much effort since I was even a child. I would naturally know how to create a mood, how to act to create happiness in someone else or get attention. I recently realised that so many people just don't know how to charm people, flatter people or give affection to people in the right ways. I think it is a gift to have this ability, because the most successful people on the planet use charm and seduction all the time but most of them have to learn, and learned charm can never really beat authentic charm. I think it's a good idea to have some posts that remind borderlines of some of the better aspects of their disorder as I think every mental health issue has some positive sides to it. :)"

You might feel unlovable or think you'll never be able to make a relationship work or fix your current one, but that isn't true. I wanted to share my story because I have felt the same way before and if I had read a ""success"" story and advice from someone who may have been going through the same things I was at that time it could have made things a bit easier. I have been with my now fiance for a total of six years. He is truly the most wonderful person I've met. Though through most of our relationship I put him through hell. I have extreme jealousy, self image and abandonment issues which have definitely made romantic relationships hard for me. I'm just going to list out some of the things I would do so either some can relate or just get a picture of how I was. I would want him to only spend time with me not anyone else, even his family. If he was with someone else I would get ""fits"" and constantly text and call him. I'm not really sure what to call this other than pretty much having a fit or a temper tantrum. It's when my mind just blows everything out of proportion and I just start wanting to throw things and pace around. I've never been worried of him cheating on me, I have been in past relationships but with him I know I have no reason at all to worry. I was jealous of him spending time with anyone that wasn't me. I had the mindset that he was choosing to spend time with someone else over me, therefore he does not love or care for me. He is a musician who tours. He would usually be gone for a month at a time and home for a few months. The longest he was gone was almost two months on a pretty popular tour in the US though I was able to join him for a few weeks at a time. When he would be gone there were times I threatened to break up with him if he didn't come home right now, which I knew was unrealistic, he had people counting on him, and was often thousands of miles away. Once it did lead to him flying home and disappointing a lot of people. Multiple times I asked him to give up him dream for me because I couldn't take him being away. I thought that he loved what he did more than he loved me even though he told me multiple times that he would stop if that was what I wanted, that being away from me was hard for him too and that he was also doing it so he could give me the things that I want, still for some reason I couldn't believe that he loved me. I would threaten to break up with him for no reason at all other than I just wanted him to try and stop me, and to say things I wanted to hear, even though he would say those things all the time for some reason I needed him to every second. Those are just a few examples. About three years of putting up with that had worn him down. It was another night where I told him I was breaking up with him wanting to hear him trying to talk me out of it but for the first time he didn't. He said he needed some time apart. It felt like the world was ending it was the first time he had ever said anything like that. I felt physically ill. He was crying saying he was so sorry but he just needed time apart to think about things. I left his house thinking that I was going to actually leave him alone for a few days like he needed and everything would be fine again but I just couldn't do it. I would go into fits and call him about 20 times in a row, text him, I would drive to his house and beg him to come outside to talk. All of those things were just pushing him away further and lead him to actually break up with me instead of just taking a bit of a break. We had been broken up for about a month, I asked him if I could come over and he agreed a few hours later he was off to see his friend and I was on my way home, taking the same freeway and was driving a bit ahead of him when a car came swerving into my lane and crashed the car right ahead of me just missing me. I pulled over to the side of the road a bit shaken up and he pulled behind me and got into my car to ask if I was okay. It lead to the most real conversation I have ever had with anyone. I laid out every single little thing I had felt that causes me to act the way that I would. I apologized and I owned up to continuously hurting him. He finally had some insight as to why I acted the way I did. It took some more conversations but we were back together and happier than ever the next month. That was three years ago. For anyone in a relationship that is just hanging on by its last thread the best thing you can do is be honest about everything, every single thing. I never told him the reasons why I acted the way I did. I didn't want him to know the reason I picked fights with him and threatened to break up with him was because I needed some kind of emotional response from him so I could feel loved, but I told him and he understood. It was the most embarrassing thing ever to admit that for some reason the picture he posted when he was on tour of his sisters captioned ""miss them too"" made me feel overwhelmed with jealousy and about to threaten to break up with him just so I could hear that he doesn't want to be without me, even though he had just posted a picture of me with a paragraph of how much he loves and misses me just seconds before. They need to know why you act the way you do, even if it embarrasses you to admit. Be vulnerable. If you were an emotional abuser like I had been, own up to it and apologize. Write out things you want to do differently and ask them to help hold you accountable. If you find someone who loves you enough to put up with and help you through this do not take them for granted. Let them know often how you know it can be difficult on them and how much you appreciate them. My relationship with my fiance is stronger than it's ever been and we are happier than we have ever been, it's hard dealing with BPD in a relationship but if your SO has the information they need and the willingness a healthy relationship is very possible. I am nowhere near as bad as I used to be but I do still get the occasional episode, just yesterday he went out to dinner with his sister because she is moving out of state and I was irrationally jealous that he would be spending that hour or so with her instead of me. We have a code word I'll say in text sometimes just to let him know that I feel a certain way and he just texted me ""don't be silly baby, I love you so so much and I'll see you in an hour"" and it calms me down. If we didn't do that it would probably result in me getting overly jealous and threatening to break up with him. Ideally I wouldn't even have thoughts like that or the need to be constantly reassured I'm loved because it's ridiculous. But having a mental illness is not ideal. Learning how to make a relationship work with one can take time, patience, and vulnerability, and is very possible. "

But a lot of the time, I feel like I'm putting on an act. I mean, I [may?] not be...because in the moment I'm not consciously acting, but there's this weird uncomfortable feeling of a lack of authenticity. I sometimes ask myself, ""um, am I being myself? whatever the hell that means?"". What is this feeling? And why do we experience it? I also ""know"" on a logical level that there ""isn't anything wrong with me"", but - I feel like there is. And I want to be close to others, but I'm so afraid that they'll ""see the real me"" (whoever that is), and that they won't like me. Its like I'm trapped in a gray area being feeling like an impostor and understanding that vulnerability and letting myself be seen is necessary. "

This has been a good outlet so I'll just post it. My ex is at it again...playing with my emotions and I'm trying really hard not to let it get to me and not let him see my vulnerability. Lately, he's been texting me a lot with small talk. ""Hi"" and ""how are you?"" Etc etc. My mind still brightens up when I see his name pop up on my phone (my overpowering emotional side), but my logical side is like ""no no no...don't read it. Don't respond. Toxic."" Today, he tried Facetiming me and I was busy, so I didn't answer. An hour passed and I get a text, ""call me when you can, I miss you."" Of course, he knows the ""I miss you"" is a good bait for me. I gave in and eventually called him back 30 minutes later. The conversation was: Him: ""Hey"" Me: ""What's up?"" Him: ""Oh laying down and watching TV with [his pseudo new partner]"" Okay...so start of this convo and he's already trying to trigger jealousy. More small talk...then he starts telling me about a fun party that he and his new partner went to and that they are going back to that condo tonight to have a round #2. I'm just like, ""sounds fun..."" I'm sure he could tell I was over the conversation. I didn't say much more. He was like, ""ummmm...are you driving right now?"" I affirmed I was. Then, silence got awkward and he said, ""wellllll, I just wanted to say hi. I've been thinking about you. Stay in touch."" I said, ""sure..."" and hung up. My heart sank. I was angry at myself for calling him back, for hoping that he would not push my buttons. I know this conversation doesn't sound that bad to some people, but it was really crushing. It's this passive aggressive bs that he does...and it's definitely a form of bullying, considering he KNOWS what hurts me and focuses on trying to hone in on that. I just wish I could find the courage and power to not let him overpower me and allow my emotions to give in to what he wants. I don't know what the purpose of his emotional abuse is anymore. We have somewhat been on good terms...why would you want to hurt someone? I guess I don't understand because I would NEVER go out of my way to have that lack of empathy or cruelness. "

I am dealing with a tough situation that I hope people can help give me insight to, since my mind is at such a vulnerable place right now. After being in a toxic relationship for 3 years, I recently was diagnosed with BPD. Not much later, I met a guy who seemed really interested in getting to know me. He knew I had BPD tendencies and i was in the middle of dealing with a breakup. My friend wanted to hook me up with him. I was nervous, I wanted to put my wall up. But after the conversations we had, I felt my wall come down and my vulnerability rise. He told me that he thought my soul was beautiful, that he wanted to understand me, and just so much nice shit that took my heart away. Well him and the friend had a falling out, and apparently it was over me. apparently she was trying to use me against him, threatening to tell me stuff about him if he pissed her off. As a result, he totally changed his behavior toward me. And of course, I felt myself get clingy and helpless and go into that desperate state of constantly apologizing for anything I may have did to make him act differently toward me. There was one time when I asked him to stop sending me sexual things because it messed with my mind, and he replied ""it's not that serious"" and ""you're not the only one going throgh shit"". Well long story short, he and the girl who set me up with him suddenly became friends again and I freaked out. I felt left out, like I needed them, like I wanted to be around them. So I profusely apologized for everything I did. Today, he basically ripped me a new asshole. Told me that I only care about myself, that I want everyone to feel sorry for me, that my words don't mean shit. That I need to stop blaming everything on my ""mental illness"" (he literally put it in quotes). That I'm an attention seeker, that I need to just chill the fuck out with messaging him, that I need to just stop what I'm doing and move on, that he's been throgh way worse and I've never had to experience any ""real problems"", and that I don't actually have borderline.....but just ""anxiety"" and my mental illness is a fluke and all in my head BC apparently borderline is a ""closed case"" and ""most people are misdiagnosed"". I told him that he doesn't know me and doesn't know the mental anguish I experience on a day to day basis he said, ""lol I do know you, I know the truth and everyone who follows you on your tumblr knows the truth, you wear your heart on your sleeve and you need to stop that shit"". I'm afraid he might be right about everything. I'm scared, Reddit. What if i actually am just a horrible selfish human being and I'm simply blaming everything on my borderline? I don't think I can live with that fact. I'd rather be dead than be selfish and only caring about my own problems. I want to be compassionate and not make everything about me, I just haven't yet learned how. To be honest, being diagnosed with borderline saved my life because for so long I thought I was just awful and batshit crazy. I have hope for the first time in forever, but now I'm having a lot of self doubt and destructive thoughts because of what he said. Does anybody else struggle with this? I want, more than anything, to be a loving compassionate person and I'm trying as hard as I can but sometimes I just don't have the emotional energy to fight the urges. And I'm so scared that maybe I am just this awful selfish person but I'm not quite sure yet how to fix it. I'm in DBT but i feel like everything is moving at a snails pace, and I don't think this medication is working. Please help. "
178,vulnerability,BPD,I would like to make a request of the mods plz?,4,4gvs66,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/4gvs66/i_would_like_to_make_a_request_of_the_mods_plz/,2016-04-29 05:55:36,"Would it be possible to have one of the mods or members of the /r/psychology or /r/AcademicPsychology community to explain to us why pwBPD are discouraged from being friends? What are the dangers of our forming real life groups? Sure, two of us could trigger each other - but if there were more than two? Surely we couldn't all co-trigger if there were a dozen of us? I've seen us trigger each other on this sub and in the chat. So what, exactly, is the big deal? Doesn't real life trigger us anyway? What's the difference between others triggering us and us triggering each other? I have about a million questions along these lines. Can we have an AMA or something? **Update**: I would like to thank the mod in advance for being willing to answer my question. I'm seriously looking forward to some professional input. It's been a hot topic on this sub lately. I took this out of the reply I sent to Rain12913: The only place in life I feel truly ""met"" as a being is on this sub. However, these are anonymous usernames on a screen... Someone gave me ""e-hugs"" in another reply, and I appreciate them very much, but I seriously could have used a real-life hug. We're also discouraged from disclosing our diagnosis after therapy, but what do we have to be ashamed of, and why can't we be more ""out"" so we can find each other? Why aren't there ongoing support meetings for pwBPD? The DBT program is very well structured, and it helped: It took a BPD to help BPDs - so what are the dangers? Imagine what would have happened to the rest of us if Marsha Linehan had decided she was recovered, wasn't going to disclose, and was just going to walk away with gratitude that she was cured. She didn't give up on us - she gave back. Although, it did take her years to disclose publicly - it was at the urging of one of her clients so we would see that pwBPD are capable of great things. I don't think we should be left alone after therapy ""like preschoolers being forced to take responsibility for an illness."" - quote from Joy Campbell I may have skills now, but no one did brain surgery on me - I still think and feel the same - I just respond differently because I can slow it down. I've learned to be mindful and accepting enough to put my ""normal person face"" on, but I still can't related to anyone deeply because I can't let them see into me too deeply. Isn't seeing and understanding someone on a deep level the very definition of intimacy? From dictionary.com: 5.(of an association, knowledge, understanding, etc.) arising from close personal connection or familiar experience. Will I never have an intimate relationship (I'm not limiting to romantic here)? My only genuinely intimate relationship seems to have been with my clinician. That's shame talk, and I wasn't ashamed of who I was before I was diagnosed. Now I KNOW there is something inside me that if others see it they will reject me from connection and belonging (paraphrasing Brene Brown's Ted talk about vulnerability). URL So where do pwBPD go to find genuine, intimate, supportive friendships and relationships if the answer isn't other recovering sufferers of BPD? "
179,vulnerability,BPD,Still dealing with a sociopath ex...and it's really difficult when you have BPD triggers,5,4itzb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/4itzb0/still_dealing_with_a_sociopath_exand_its_really/,2016-05-11 18:33:14,"I've shared various mentions of the troubles within my breakup on here since December. It's been a long process of learning, coping, grieving, realizing, forgiving, frustration, sadness. You know... I over analyze the past like a literary buff breaks down a novel. I think back on it piece by piece and structure it in my mind. I especially focus on events in this past relationship where I made a fool of myself and there was chaos. It was embrassing Bc most of them happened in the presence of my close friends...but my boyfriend at the time was there too. It would be too long to go into detail about each event, but they resulted in a rage like scenario where I would break something, yell at everyone, create a scene, etc. My friends would be confused at how I got to these points. I was confused myself. Why was I acting like this? (This was before my BPD diagnosis). My conclusion tonight: My boyfriend would always do little things to make me angry and he knew they would. He told my best friend he thought I was BPD...and he didn't tell her that he knew how to trigger ppl bc he researched it online. So his game of trigger starting began: Over many months, he would stir me up for me to make a scene for three different close friends to witness. After one, my friend was scared of my yelling and my ex comforted her and took her to his place, acting like ""ugh your friend is so horrible..you stay here with me (the boyfriend) and he is not allowed to come in."" I think she was ignorant about the emotional abuse he had been doing all day on me to lead me to a blow up. It made me look like I was psycho, when he provoked the whole thing on purpose. He wanted my friends to turn against me. He would get me worked up privately with really mean things, and then when I got upset, he would secretly put me on three way calls to let his friends hear me blow up, I later learned. I was always confused why his tone changed from before they were on the line, until after they were listening in (unbeknownst to me). He would go from yelling to really calm, just so I sounded like the loud, irrational one. He confessed a few months later that he did this all the time to ""let his friends hear how crazy I was."" I would have been fine if he hadn't pushed me to my point of lacking self control. It's like a child pulling a dog's tail...the dog keeps growling and warning it doesn't like it...child keeps doing it... And someone pulls a video camera out and only films the dog snapping at the child. Everyone thinks the dog is nasty from only that perspective when they see the video. ""Bad dog!"" ""Oh poor innocent child!"" (Assume the child knew it was riling up the dog). These incidences built up to our breakup. He had his friends backing him bc they only heard my point of anger. My friends had only got to see that for the most part too bc the ex was good at hiding his buildup to get me to anger. We broke up with a climactic scene that once again, he knew what he was doing. He even had txted me ""I will fuck up your life, just wait."" The thing with me is I wanted to see the best in him. I was disappointed with his antics, but still in denial of this ""set up"" pattern he was doing to get me worked up. Months later, he has told people this and that about me to ruin my reputation. It's hurt, but today, he sent a text. A certain trigger from his text made me realize a lot. I haven't got a text from him since December. I was surprised when I got a ""i made it into [anonymous college]."" Seemed innocent, but random that he would message me. I actually felt happy for him, thinking this was his way of sending a peaceful olive branch to show no hard feelings..as neutral as a message it was. I responded, ""congrats! I'm happy for you :) Are you still planning on the same major?"" Never a response. I started thinking he read that as sarcastic but I truly want the best for him, regardless. I think he wanted to get my attention on him to look at his facebook to see the 300 ""friend"" likes for his status on his college acceptance just to be a sort of ""haha, I'm making it loser."" He knew I would probably look if he got my attention...and it worked. He's turned so many ppl around town against me, telling about my ""freak out"" moments without explaining why they happened. Morale of the story: I think BPD are very caring, loving people. We try to work through our feelings of abandonment, rages, impulses. But, sociopaths like my ex scare the hell out of me. They are vindictive. We might get angry in some spontaneous moment, but these others plan out premeditated vengeful things that can continue months later. They use our vulnerability to their advantage. We might act out, we might get depressed, we might act needy...but we are nowhere near as dark as that kind of person. Revengeful actions don't seem common with BPD, from what I've heard...but these other sociopath types have this permanent grin of ""I'll get you soon enough."" I guess it's best to be friendly and not let them trigger a scene like they seem to want. It's like ammo against you later."
180,vulnerability,BPD,"Manipulation and ""the game""",27,4k331e,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/4k331e/manipulation_and_the_game/,2016-05-20 01:46:24,"Tl;dr: Manipulation has nothing to do with conscious intent. Manipulation is hard to stop doing. I talk a lot. This is gonna be a long one, even for me. But I've been seeing the subject of manipulation come up more and more lately, and it's one of the core issues I spent most of my teenage years struggling with. There's a lot that hits home with me, and at the same time a lot of pain and frustration I see in others being accused of manipulation and thus feeling invalidated. So, since I have nothing better to do here at work, and thus have the time and boredom, I figured I'd put some of my thoughts out there. First off, on some level ALL social interaction is manipulation. We act one way so someone responds in a way we expect. If I introduce myself and shake your hand, I'm expecting you to shake my hand and give me your name as well. There's a whole lot of subtext: I'm hoping you'll like me, I hope we have a pleasant exchange for whatever reason we're meeting, etc. There's even more subtext that goes into things which I (and you) may or may not be conscious of. It's there whether we mean it to be or not. There is no ""good"" or ""bad"" associated with most of this, but it's all manipulation. If I act a certain way and you benefit from the transaction, it's probably a socially acceptable manipulation, if I benefit to your detriment, it's probably going to be viewed negatively. But it's all still manipulation. So to explain where I'm going, I'm going to have to talk about myself a bit (big surprise, right?) If you want to skip ahead, I'll put some sort of marker (search for HI AGAIN) in all caps). But to me context is king, and I can't speak about my ideas and what's helped me without getting into what I am. Wow... Where to start with all this. Back in my younger days, I spent an inordinate amount of time learning about other people. I had no sense of self, and so I'd try to learn what made other people tick, so I could emulate them and maybe be a real person. Especially since I moved around so much, I never had any close friends, because I never knew when I'd have to move on. But I learned that I could find the most popular person in school, and get to know them better than the people who had known them for years. I belonged, because I knew more about them than anyone else. At least that was my logic. It doesn't make any sense, I know, but it was the whole of my existence for most of my childhood. Move, glom onto ""the popular person"" and become their most trusted confidant. Learn what made them tick, and thus vulnerable. If I knew their weakness, they couldn't hurt me, and if the most popular (socially powerful) person couldn't hurt me, then I must be safe. So I got good at reading people. I can articulate now what I was doing in terms of micro-gestures, NLP, etc. But when I was a kid I just called it stepping inside someone's head. I learned to understand and even predict actions. I learned to identify weakness, strength, apathy, desire, fear, acceptance, and all of the other things that make us tick. I can't count the number of times I'd have people explicitly say ""how did you know that about me, I've never told ANYONE that"" and things like that. Not to toot my own horn, but beep beep. I was good at learning what made people tick. Well, all this was ultimately a defense mechanism, a way to protect myself from harm. I saw how powerful my knowledge made me feel. Well, I'm not dumb. If knowledge gives me power, then presumably knowledge OF me would give someone else power over me. Thus began ""the game."" In an effort to protect myself, I learned to hide myself. I'd adopt specific mannerisms that would indicate weaknesses I didn't actually have so if someone was intent on destroying me (because that's TOTALLY normal for a kid to worry about, right?), they'd attack the wrong area. I spent years trying to pretend to be dumb. I'd adopt a mask of confidence, so people wouldn't know how scared I was. I even learned to adopt false indicators of fear behind the mask of confidence, so that people would think they'd see behind the mask (and thus stop looking) so I could cover my real fears, and thus my real vulnerabilities. It all became a game for me. I never lied, because I knew enough about lying to know that there are an almost infinite number of tells that can give you away. But if I imply, then I'm not lying. And holy shit did I become the master of the implication, the unstated lie, the misdirection. I was a master of The Game. I'm too embarrassed to even go into a lot of the specifics, because I'm just plain ashamed of so many of them now. I spent almost every waking minute afraid someone would see the real me, my core self, and would thus be able to reject and thus destroy me. At some point, I lost the me. I got so involved with the various manipulations, sub plots, counter intel, and The Game that I no longer knew where it stopped, and where I began. When you play The Game, you learn to identify really quick the other people who play. I suspect The Game goes hand in hand with BPD, so I'd be surprised if none of the above sounds familiar to a lot of people here. You may not be as methodical as I was. It may not be as conscious, or deliberate. But I suspect more than a few of you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, when I was in group therapy, I ended up meeting up with another player. I'll identify him as M (M, if you're reading this, drop me a line, I'd love to catch up). We pretty quickly identified the other as players, and he was the first person I met that I considered as good as I was. I think the first real one on one conversation we had basically consisted of ""I've seen you. You play the game. You're good"" and we both knew immediately what the other was talking about. We had long and involved conversations, traded tips, and really upped each others skills. And eventually I got good enough, that I saw what end game was. And it wasn't pretty. And so I decided for my own sanity, I needed to stop playing. M and I had even more in depth conversations about how to stop playing, and eventually some things finally crystalized in my head. HI AGAIN, welcome back. tl;dr: I was good at manipulating people, but I decided that needed to stop. So what did I do? So the problem with manipulation is if you're any good at it, it comes naturally, and almost without thinking. Which makes it damned hard to stop. Because the only counter to manipulating is to tell people what you're doing. Which becomes just another manipulation tactic. And it all becomes just a further expression of that same vicious cycle. If you're manipulating people, then you never know how true they are to you. If you're hiding yourself then other people's acceptance of you doesn't matter, because they don't know the real you. If I get someone to do what I want, because ""if they loved/liked me they'd do X"" then part of me knows I've manipulated them into it, so I can no longer tell if they really do like me. Meanwhile, all of the objective data points to ""they like me,"" but I don't feel validated, and I feel even worse because I know none of it will ever be enough. So then they need to do even more, which I'll make them do, and then dismiss because I just manipulated them into it... so yeah. A vicious cycle. So what did I do? Well, initially I'd start just playing against myself. I'd start looking at myself as a separate person, and started plotting how I'd counter them if they did exactly what I was doing. Then I'd assume they did that, and looked at how I'd respond, and carried it all down the line. Eventually I'd get a point where I felt that the situation had played itself out, and I'd look at the results. If favorable, I'd pretend all that happened, and then I wouldn't need to engage with the other person. So I'd at least stop the expression that way. If negative, I knew it would be a bad idea to do the thing, so I wouldnt do it. Ultimately though, I finally learned that manipulation was all about meeting my needs. So I'd use my various tricks to figure out what my real needs were. I could pick a fight with my significant other because I'd know that eventually things would come back around to a tearful expression of love, and I'd feel validated, at least a little bit. So why not just ask for that? Holy shit, the first time I did that was one of the scariest moments in my life. I'd spent so much time protecting myself that to lay myself bare, to say ""I'm feeling pretty scared and vulnerable right now, can I have a hug"" was like jumping off a bridge. But you know what? I got my needs met. And without all the grand machinations I had previously engaged in. I learned to say ""I am feeling unloved; can you tell me why you appreciate me? I know it sounds silly, but I could really use that right now."" And I avoided the fight. The other person didnt feel backed into the corner, I didnt go all crazy, and everyone won. I learned when I wanted something from someone to just ask. The closer the friend, the more direct and vulnerable the request (never one without the other for me, because the vulnerability was what was driving the request). Now, there's a fine line. I spoke earlier about the masks behind the mask, and that's the number one thing I learned to be careful of. If I had a deeper need than the one I was trying to meet, then I'd catch myself manipulating things to get that deeper need met. So what was intended to be an explicit request with an accompanying vulnerability, was actually just yet another manipulation. And that does me no good, because the REAL need doesn't get met. But I digress. I see a lot of talk about how manipulative BPD people are. And, unfortunately, they're right. We don't mean to be, but we often are. I chose to embrace that aspect of myself, but I was doing it regardless. When I cut, it wasn't a conscious ""oh, they're going to see this and act this way."" But a lot of times, it was ""Look what they've made me do."" And that, to me is the hallmark of manipulation. I was involving others in decisions that I was claiming were all about me. If there were no others, if there was no exchange of energy/intent/whatever you want to call it, then why are they even in my head when I'm doing these things? So yes, the behavior was ultimately manipulative. It may not be meant to be manipulative, but it was. I was trying to get others to accept blame/responsibility/whatever the only way I knew how. By taking it out on myself. Look at what you made me do. I wasnt directly involving them in reality, but I was doing the emotional equivalent of sticking my tongue out at them behind their back. But in my head I was still interacting with them. I was powerless to do it directly, so I was using myself as a simulacrum for the fight I wanted to have with them. It was still manipulation; I was just powerless to do the actual manipulations I wanted to. So, whenever my acting out was noticed then all of the play would come out. It was almost like baiting a trap in my mind. I dont want them to find out, but if they do, then this, that, the other will go through their head, and Ill win But yeah, Im getting pretty far afield at this point. All this is by way of saying that manipulation has nothing to do with a conscious choice. I was manipulating people while I was alone in my bedroom. I was manipulating people when Id get people to think they knew the real me. The list goes on and on. I was trying to get my needs met, all through the only way I knew how. I never lied, I never bluffed, I never thought I was doing anything wrong. But I was still being manipulative early on. I eventually learned to adopt it. And even later Ive learned to not do it. But its still there. The final thing that helped me stop the inappropriate manipulations was the realization that the impression of being manipulated is valid whether or not it was intended. Someone is put in a situation where they have no choice but to respond a certain way, and thats often not going to sit well with them. Even if I was acting with all of the altruistic intent in the world, if I was putting someone in a position where they had to respond in a specific way (due to social pressure/mores/guilt/fear/whatever), then I was manipulating them. Even if I didnt mean to, the manipulation was still there. The value judgement of the person depended on a bunch of factors. Whether they responded with a big hug and approval or a oh jeez, not this shit again was up in the air, but it was still manipulation. So yeah. In my experience people often resort to manipulation even if they dont realize it. I did, and chose to embrace it, and ultimately realized how damaging it is to relationships and even myself. If Im trying to figure out if Im manipulating someone, I look at what the desired result is. If its not explicitly what Im asking for, then Im probably being manipulative. Thats not necessarily a bad thing, but it is still manipulation. "

He spent the night and we had sex. He told me how ""beautiful"" I was and that he has ""always secretly loved me"". Well, of course, my stupid BPD self ate that right up. So fast forward to tonight. He meets up with me to watch the Superbowl. He acts incredibly distant the whole time and tells me that he's sick so he doesn't want to get too close to me. Umm what? Strange. So the Superbowl ends, he gives me an awkward hug, and immediately goes home. I text him a little later and tell him I'm concerned about him. This is where the fucked up part happens. So he texts back and says that he ""made a mistake"" by sleeping with me the other night and hopes that I can forgive him for taking advantage of me. WHAT? Are you serious?! So he basically admitted to using my emotional vulnerability for his sexual gratification. This was someone I trusted. Not only that, but he came over to my house today knowing this and didn't tell me! He ate my food, watched my TV, and engaged me in conversation. I feel like an object that he used up and doesn't need anymore. I never would have thought that such a close friend would betray me like this. EDIT: Thanks for your kind words, guys. I just wanted to update everybody further on what happened. I wish I could tell you it got better, but it didn't. I texted him back and asked for him please not to speak to me anymore. He did agree to that, but not before further explaining his motive behind this. It was apparently *not* a spur of the moment thing. He had planned this several weeks ago because he thought it would help him get over his ex. I don't know if he has psychopathic issues or what but I was floored by this. Yeah, so today has been pretty shitty but your responses have made me feel a lot better! "

It is **always** a ten. The emotional dysregulation is strong with this one. Heh. Happiness and other positive emotions can and do fall sometimes in the middle. It depends on the reason. But no - not anger, irritation, irritability, despair, vulnerability, sadness, anxiousness, spite, regret and any other gut wrenching, soul crushing emotion you can name. And because of that my reactions are proportionate to my intense emotions even if the intensity is not necessary. It's too damn bad. I've gone from 0 to 60 in no time flat. So to reevaluate... Something not great happens  negative emotion slams into me at a 10 of 10  reaction is a 10 as a result.

So I masturbate sometimes to regain some level of control and know I can do it on my own heh. It is better than self harming in a violent way too so winwin. However, lately I've found myself only being turned on when I fantasise about having a penis and being the dominant individual in the senario whatever it may be. I would consider myself cisfemale but have always and regularly though about how I would like to experience being male. I've always been more of a masculine kid and less about the stereotypically feminine kid and sometimes feel male inside. However, I don't know if it is my intense fear of abandonment leading me to fantasise about being the controlling male figure in my imagination because I somehow believe that would make it more difficult for me to get hurt? I don't know just going on now. Has anybody else thought similar things? Why? Why not?"

187,vulnerability,BPD,Feeling repulsed by emotional intimacy. AKA not being able to stand the one thing I want most?,1,3ifsup,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3ifsup/feeling_repulsed_by_emotional_intimacy_aka_not/,2015-08-26 17:03:27,"Hi everyone. This may be a little long, but I really appreciate those of you who take the time to read it. I've always felt that there was something wrong with the way that I interact with the world and my relationships. Ever since I was a child, emotional intimacy has actually repulsed me. It's awful because I am such an emotional person and I think I'm very empathetic. I cherish and yearn for intimate relationships, platonic or otherwise, but I simply cannot stand them. The vulnerability eats away at me and when I feel that someone is getting too close or that I am feeling too much for them, I feel sick. I mean physically ill. I get anxious, nauseous and sometimes even panic when I start to feel like things are getting too ""real"". I remember as a kid, when people would cry or show emotion around me I would feel so uncomfortable and sick about it, even as I yearned to comfort them and show how much I care. As I've grown older, being in any sort of romantic relationship requires me to basically ride these waves of full-blown panic, nausea and fear. I will project these feelings on to my partners, even when I know that they have done nothing wrong. Hell, even when I can't THINK of anything wrong with them, I still feel claustrophobic and nauseous when I think too long about the relationship and them. It's really hard to explain. It's almost like a fear of commitment, like the idea of being with someone long-term makes me feel like I'm being dunked in ice water. Sometimes even seeing the way that other couples and people interact makes me feel repulsed, even as I know that it is completely irrational for me to. Sexual intimacy seems perfectly fine, although my first (consenting) sexual encounters were not in relationships, nor were they built on trust or love. There have been times when the thought of sex with someone makes me feel the same repulsion, but it's easier for me to shut it off in those situations. I think I go the sexual route because it's easier, it's like a quick fix for what I really want- emotional intimacy and complexity. Yet, the thought of all of that is awful to me. Even silly things, like using the restroom or making food, become disgusting when my partner does them. Like being human is so gross and I feel repulsed by it. I can't really parse out how I feel or what I'm trying to say, but I hope it makes some sense. I remember when I was in outpatient treatment- after I was hospitalized and diagnosed- the psych who was treating me said something that really stuck with me. He said something like, ""The one thing you crave so deeply is the one thing that repels you"". And I think it's so true. And I understand the ""I hate you, don't leave me"" part of it. Yet that seems separate from this. That is on top of this, and maybe this is at the core, but from all the stuff I've read I have yet to find something that I can relate to as far as the sheer disgust I feel at opening up, at being vulnerable. I've been thinking a lot about this lately and I really need to know that I am not the only one who feels this way. It would also be awesome if anyone has any coping strategies/ ways to overcome this. "
188,vulnerability,BPD,Gentle reminder: Actions vs BPD,84,3brilw,http://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/3brilw/gentle_reminder_actions_vs_bpd/,2015-07-02 01:51:06,"I'm seeing a lot of people posting lately about how it's BPD that's causing a bunch of various issues, ranging from job/relationship/loss of friends, etc. Believe me, I understand completely how much BPD fucks with your thoughts, and how it becomes easy to act out on them. But every time you blame BPD, you're putting the problems outside of your control. If you instead focus on your actions, then you are dealing with something you can work on. You can be 100% sure your SO is getting ready to leave you, or hates you, or is deliberately doing stuff to piss you off. That's BPD. You choosing to act on those feelings is YOU. It's YOUR choice. Work is stressful, which makes you short tempered, irritable, etc? You think you're going to get fired and everyone hates you? Yeah, that's BPD. Not taking a second to breathe and bring yourself back into now, so you go off on your boss/coworker and get fired? That's your actions. I'm not trying to talk down to anyone, trust me, I'm living the struggle too. But as long as you're externalizing things, or using BPD as a reason that you're having life issues, then you ARE out of control, and things are going to get worse. Step back, own what you can. In this case, it's your actions. And those you can work on, and try to do better with. Stay strong guys, we can make it through this. BPD is a hurdle to overcome, but sometimes the hurdles are what teach you to be strong and grow. You CAN make it. You can, and will, get through this (whatever this is for you). Edit: someone posted a comment and then deleted it. I've decided to include my response here because it helped me to type it, and because the voice that's telling me to just delete everything is the one I've learned not to listen to. The comment basically revolved around how some people with BPD just don't have that control, and can't stop the impulsive actions. (I'll throw a trigger warning up to be polite, but I'm also not a fan of the idea of trigger warnings in settings like this). Here is my response: I can't speak for anyone else, only myself. That being said, there's a slight difference which, for me, ends up being important. For me, the impulsivity hinged on the ""rightness"" of the thoughts. I could justify all these ""crazy"" actions because in my head all of the fears became my reality. As long as I accepted that my thoughts were justified and valid, then my actions made sense. So it wasn't impulsive acts, it was actually thought out ones, albeit only a quick thought. For me, recognizing that my internal thoughts were flawed, and not based on reality is what helps temper the justification for the actions, which is what leads to less ""impulsive"" behavior. My concern with accepting the impulsivity as ""just part of BPD"" is to at least passively give it control over you. If you own your actions, the good and the bad, then you can at least work in the future on tempering them. If you just say ""well, it's the BPD, I had no choice"" then you're dooming yourself to failure from the outset. All that being said, I'll throw out one other thing I've found. It's not going to be popular with a lot of people, but I know how much it helped me, and I've seen how much it has helped some other people. For various reasons, society has begun to encourage what I call a ""victim"" mentality. Especially with BPD this means that there will always be people to tell you: &gt; * You're not wrong for thinking of things this way &gt; * You're not wrong for acting out &gt; * You have no control over it &gt; * Oh, these horrible things happened to you, so therefore you should be excused from being held responsible for your actions In a perfect world, they are right: It sucks that our disorder causes us to have a flawed way of thinking. It doubly sucks because most of us have a pretty shitty life story. Everyone I've met with BPD has had some pretty significant trauma in their lives. So we get a double whammy. It sucks that we have to relive things, and pay even more for our trauma, and it's very convenient to try and lay our problems on other people. It's very easy to say ""well, it's everyone else's responsibility to learn how to handle me like this, they need to understand where I'm coming from, etc."" Ultimately though, I find that way ends up creating more problems. Because we have to live in reality, and the reality is, other people don't ""owe us"" anything. If we go through life expecting everyone else to compensate for our own inadequacies, then we're going to have even more pain and more and more negative consequences because things aren't ""right."" We'll push more and more people away, we'll engage in more and more questionable behavior, we'll rip our souls to tatters railing against how unfair things are. All because we were looking for others to change their actions instead of owning ours. Or, we can accept that WE have flaws, but those flaws do NOT have to change our actions, and our actions are what will people use to determine how they treat us. I've done the SI, I've tasted the gun barrel, I've ripped my hair out, I've sat curled into a fetal ball with waves of physical, tangible pain rolling over me while I relived the shit I've been through. I know that BPD is what led me to think those actions were ok, but *I* was the one who decided at the time they were acceptable actions. If I hide behind the idea that ""oh well, I just can't control myself"" then I'm dooming myself to repeat those things again. I'd rather fight the fight, and take my lumps and continue on, for as long as I can. Because as fucked up as this world is, there is still enough beauty and joy around to make the pain worth it. I can't see that rainbow without that rainstorm. I can't love deeply without feeling that pain and vulnerability because I've given a part of myself to someone else. I can't feel that visceral joy we can sometimes feel when shit is going well without that stone of dread in my gut, worrying about what bad is going to come down the pipes. But I can't do ANY of these things if I'm not at least tangentially in control of myself. If I can't own part of my own body, then I can't continue on, which means I'll miss out on all that good. If you're in pain, if you're thinking of acting out, or worse yet, ending it, I get it. It sucks. I can't make those thoughts go away. No one can. But thoughts without action are nothing. You can want to end things because it feels like things aren't going to get better. But as long as you recognize those thoughts are flawed, then there's no reason to act on them. You may want to cut, to act out, to do whatever. But that want is NOT the act. We CAN temper our actions to pull ourselves back from the brink. We can accept that our thoughts are based on those scars we got from the battles long past, and those to come. But our actions are NOT part of those scars. I have a BIG problem with the idea that expecting others to change their actions simply because of our wounds is a healthy choice. Hoping for them to? Sure, I'm fine with that. But expecting it is just setting yourself up for failure. Which means the only thing you should be focused on is YOU, because that's the only thing you have power over. And to me, giving up my power to the circumstances that have led me here is just not in it. I'll go down fighting. I'm obviously amped up, and I'm very tempted to just purge this all, but I've been there. I've used the excuses and I've seen what problems they caused. I've played the victim, and paid the price. I'm not interested in sugar coating things; working through BPD is hard. But it can be done, and it's worth it. I am worth it. YOU are worth it. tl;dr: Own your shit. Work your shit. Lose your shit. Let your shit go. Sometimes it's the shit that lets the flowers grow."
189,vulnerability,BPD,Minimizing one's dark side,10,39t5v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/39t5v3/minimizing_ones_dark_side/,2015-06-15 01:03:26,"I feel like living with BPD is like living with a unique vulnerability, and part of understanding how to live a healthy life is basically learning how to minimize situations that expose this vulnerability. I posted before about how borderlines 'split' other people, and I feel like I myself am 'split'. In many ways. But definitely in the sense that I have a really good, positive, caring side that comes out when my life feels together but also an extremely dark side that comes out when I feel hurt by others. I think learning how to control my borderline personality tendencies in part lies with trying live my life in a way that reduces the likelihood that dark side will be brought out. It is bad. It's bad for me, and others. But that dark side is undeniably triggered by certain events and people. I can't exactly erase that part of me. But no one can change reality so that if their body is injured physically it doesn't hurt or bleed, can they? So they try to minimize situations where they get hurt. Borderlines are just more vulnerable to emotional pain than others, and understanding this and modifying one's life according may allow them to avoid further pain in the future."

I'm so fucking tired of this shit. I left town for almost two weeks to get away from all this shit. A failed relationship with this girl I completely fell for and the intense jealous I felt afterward as she became really close to this other guy, whom I hate, whom I also work for, and who clearly is into her. And she of course plays along because she is wanting to get hired by this guy, and it works, and he is showering her with the special treatment while I just stare at it from the grave burning with rage and hatred as I wish she would text me or show me any sign that I matter at all. But all I get is the relentless memories of everything we had together and of course the fucking conversation where she told me she was afraid of being with me because she thought it ""might bring back her social anxiety"" that she apparently had in the past. How the fuck am I supposed to feel about that??? Well I'm fucking sorry if I've been repeatedly treated like such shit in my lifetime on so many occasions that it is hard for me to open up to others! Is it that fucking bad that I should be made to feel like I'm some cursed monster? I already feel like a goddamned cursed monster. And as if I want to be like this! My social anxiety is one of the things I hate the most about myself! It's caused me so much grief! And to tell me something like that... make me feel like this curse that I despise about myself is one of the very reasons why you don't want to be with me... How the fuck am I supposed to take that? Well obviously I took it by ending up on the brink of killing myself. Literally on the fucking edge. That among so many others things... I finally I quit the new job I had just started and left town to be with the few friends I actually have in this world. I was breaking to pieces. I couldn't take it. I left for two weeks but finally came back to start working at my old job again. I actually had begun to feel better while I was away in a more nurturing environment. Now I'm back and it's like all that progress just collapsed instantly. Seeing her... seeing everything... memories flooding back. These places. God how I hate the way memories get attached to locations for me. I'm not even trying to fucking remember it! My emotional health capsizing into the wasteland of chaos that it was before. I don't know how I can endure this. This is the most pain I have ever felt in my life and I feel like there is just nothing I can do to escape it. I didn't fucking ask for this. And you know why I have a hard time trusting others and opening up in social situations? BECAUSE OF SHIT LIKE THIS! As soon as I open up, like I did with this girlof course, that's probably what did it, when she saw how much of an emotional madhouse I amshit catches on fire and the next thing I know is I'm just watching that person disappear away from me. This formula: 1) I feel desperate loneliness and longing for other people who care about me. 2) Someone appears that might be able to give me that. I trust them. 3) They turn me away and I lose the chance to be close with them. 4) Destruction. 5) Desperation and longing increase dramatically, along with fear. I fucking hate this. And there is this unresolvable tension inside me. On the one hand, this girl has seriously hurt me more deeply than I have ever been hurt before. My life and existence don't even feel real to me right now. But on the other... for fuck's sake I fell for her! I really adore her. She's beautiful and lovely and it's like regardless of how hurt I was by her insensitivity and outright cruelty and disrespect for who I am, there are other qualities about her that I fucking love... Like, from an objective standpoint there are things I think are very valuable and precious about her. She's a fucking treasure in my opinion. Nevertheless she still hurt me in her selfishness and recklessness. I'm splitting the fuck out but it's like both extremes coexist and I'm just sitting her in this contradiction totally unable to function. I want her more than anything. I never want to see her or her about her again. How can I feel both of these things simultaneously? I feel like it's literally ripping me apart from the inside out. And more than anything I'm just thinking What is the fucking point of all of this? This isn't something where later I will be like ""Oh, yeah, that was bad but I learned so much from that and grew as a person."" Will I? Do I feel that way about my past failures and disappointments? Pain for the sake of pain. Futile pain. That's what this feels like. Pain that nothing can even be learned from. All I have is one more really fucking strong reason to never trust someone again and risk putting myself in this extreme place of vulnerability: that is, where I just want someone to love and to love me. Fuck me I'm sorry I've never had that before and it's made me a miserable person in so many ways. TL;DR: Jesus. I'm really not in a good place right. It's fucking dark."

They weren't an expert in this area so they couldn't say for sure, only that everything is uncertain. They suggested EMDR and other therapies... they referred me but they couldn't help me either, and now I went back to the GP(UK), and then I was put on a waiting list to be re-assessed. Except I had an episode, I was a tad paranoid, began cutting myself and punching walls... I stopped making sense, apparently, I felt manic but nothing too, like a fever which you know is ill. So I went back to the GP, and hopefully I am now being assessed and treated fairly soon, I had an episode almost a year ago, I hallucinated and insomnia and derealisation, depersonalisation, more self-harming... my mind was like voided, I can't get me back now. It was after a break up, and after my friend dropped out of school. I did good right? I want to hurt myself now... like I totally have a blood fetish or something haha. I decided to go to the GP, because of my friend and she has her own problems, she can't deal with having to deal with me self-harming. She has a lot of trauma surrounding a sexual assault that effects her in relationships, or that's what she believes but she was like it beforehand, she tell me more if she wants. When I empathise with people I dissociated into them, I essentially see, feel their perspective, I become them temporarily, she opened up to me a day ago, and I can still feel raping her, and being raped as her. I mean I love her, I feel disgusting, I feel so dirty, but my empathy, the intensity, when she reached out to me, I could help her, I think/hope I did, she might be getting therapy now, like me. We're quite the pair... except no relationship until I am more stable or helping myself, the same goes for her, then she ""could love me like I do for her"". Both of us don't know why I am so uncanny, she just says it is because I pay attention. We are actually fairly healthily codependent to each other. apart from the fact I behave just as bad relationships as her, just the opposite way, she is avoidant but craves attachment, and I crave attachment too, but I am controlling and anxious about it. Thankfully, I can count on one hand how many times an ex-gf has called me a psychopath. Beforehand I was keeping my promise, no self-harming, but the day before she told me, the day before today. I had a traumatic childhood.. enough for when I saw my dad purposely hurting the cat, I saw *that* facial expression, those eyes. So I have a bit of trauma related structural dissociation, Like I am programmed to turn on this dark side to me, as a defensive measure to myself or others. So punched him, and attacked him, I had to protect the cat and my sister, I had to. His response, stair at me. Throw the cat down the stairs, she cut her nose. He really got me. I felt so guilty so I went back to my room and punched the wall to mangle my hand a bit, when I am like this I don't feel pain. So I broke my promise, within a couple of days. I mean I didn't cut myself, so that is good. I feel so strange, haha like I don't feel angry, or sad or anxious I feel nothing, but I am angry, sad and anxious. I feel like I lie to myself and others about who I am, my memories are shattered, so my life and identity is too. So I don't know what is wrong with me, I am a psychology student, who apparently to where I volunteer I am very insightful about all the bad things in the world, maybe my memories are encoded semantically opposed to episodically, so I understand things, but I can't integrate it into personal experience. So I have my bets of BPD, or something CPTSD.. if it isn't BPD... I'm only 18, Male, I don't know who I will be tomorrow, let alone 5 years time. I wanted to be a psychologist, or join the police because I wanted to protect and help people, I can't do that now. I know I can't, I wouldn't cope, but **I hate people calling me weak or selfish, I hate it**. I should do something else... Doctor? no still too dangerous for me, but I want to... maybe cybersecurity, I'm good at that stuff weirdly... you can see my problem here. I have a very important question I need it answered. Why am I a sexual sadist? I mean only if it is fake, or consensual... real murder, torture and rape, that is horrible, I actually had to go cry in the toilets when sexual assault came up during my volunteer training. Why do I have these feelings? I feel so bad sharing them, especially with my friend, even though she insists I'm a good person and the worse I feel the more hyper-sexual I become. Is it because of trauma? None of my trauma was sexual in nature, I mean there was a few psychosexual trauma dotted here and there but who hasn't had that... no all my trauma was physical and psychological. So how did it happen is it my nature? Is it in my genes (probably considering). I know I am a good person, but am I a dangerous person? Are there things I should avoid, knowing it might trigger dissociation and I might do something terrible? I would say God Help me, but then I despise the idea of god. sentence basically sums me up haha."
