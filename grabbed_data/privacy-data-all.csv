I am currently having a though experiment of how to get the best possible secure online environment for e.g. journalists who want to leak information, or just to generally find a way to be truly anonymous in the digital world. I am aware that there is no such thing as 'absolute' security, but 99% would be fine in most cases  ____________________________ My thoughts so far. Open for discussion and suggestions. Hardware needed: 1. Need to find a used notebook and buy it cash. The communication with the seller is needs to be non-digital like a backyard sale, flea market or just from a small electronics store (bonus points for a store without a security camera). Because every computer device has a burned-in hardware identification number (MAC-Number). 2. Need to find a prepaid, preregistered SIM-Card. In my country (EU) it is illegal to sell preregistered SIM-Cards. People need to register the SIM-Cards with their ID-Card, but I found that in bigger cities there are shops inside or nearby Train stations or Airports who still sell them for tourists which need fast access to SIM-Cards to call home after arrival. 3. Need to find a USB modem for the SIM-Card, also bought cash. Now that we have our hardware, we get to the software steps: 4. We need a VPN service. Preferably with servers in a country with strict privacy laws like Switzerland or Sweden. There are several VPNs which can be paid anonymously trough cash. Either buying a activation-code in a store by cash or just sending cash by mail to the VPN provider for a registration without a bank transfer trace. 5. Anonymous fake eMail addresses preferably with servers in a country with strict privacy laws like Switzerland or Sweden (or temporary eMail addresses if the online service allows it). 6. All passwords used should be different for each service and account, long with special letters, generated random from a computer and also randomly changed by a human. It can be written down somewhere since it's too hard to remember, but maybe additionally write some special letter in between which you know are not used. 7. In case the computer is going to get raided some day it should be encrypted. With a mac e.g FileVault. 8. For browsing using the software TOR with plugins like 'HTTPS everywhere', 'Disable WebRTC' and 'User-Agent Switcher'. ____________________________ That is so far what I got, need more input. Should a 'Guest account' be used for login into the computer so that the files and everything are going to be erased after each session? One vulnerability I can see already is that IF your VPN provider is going to give up your actual IP-Address, the position of the USB-SIM-Modem could be tracked trough cellular triangulation. In this case there might be a solution to having a mobile phone powered by solar panels positioned in a different city working as a transit spot for data. But this would significantly add to the costs and effort to the whole thing. Also I am not familiar with DNS Service security, could anyone explain if there is a security risk and how to solve it? ____________________________ Thanks for reading "
4,vulnerability,privacy,Why I think Signal's increased reliance on SGX is a mistake,3,hm2fwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hm2fwx/why_i_think_signals_increased_reliance_on_sgx_is/,2020-07-06 16:28:11,"SGX is a set of instruction codes available on certain Intel CPUs. SGX allows the CPU to create secure processing enclaves  private memory regions  and execute code inside these enclaves without external processes being able to read or save the code being executed. SGX also supports remote attestation, which lets a client verify that the code running in an SGX enclave is the code it is expected to be. Signal uses SGX for several current and upcoming features such as contact discovery (Your friend is on Signal!) and their planned username feature which will reduce (but not eliminate) the apps reliance on phone numbers as identifiers. SGX is a key part of how Signal implements these features without compromising user privacy. However, there are two main problems that I can see with relying on SGX. * **Firstly: SGX is the polar opposite of free or open-source.** SGX is a completely proprietary technology that can only be found on specific Intel CPUs. Using SGX with remote attestation requires either signing a corporate licensing agreement with Intel directly, or relying on a limited range of other private cloud providers (IBM, Alibaba, and Microsoft Azure). Signals reliance on SGX for key features makes it extremely difficult to deploy open-source forks of Signal that can integrate with the network. * **Secondly: SGX itself is compromised.** Among the recent spate of Intel CPU vulnerabilities have been several side-channel attacks (most notably, [CacheOut](URL that allow the attacker to extract information from an SGX secure enclave. In the specific case of CacheOut, security researchers found that the vulnerability could allow malicious Signal servers to create false secure enclaves which expose all data they receive while appearing completely benign to Signal clients. Not good. TL;DR: Intel SGX lets Intel CPUs run code in a secure enclave where it cant be accessed by other processes. Signal uses SGX for contact discovery and their upcoming username feature. This is a problem because 1) SGX is vulnerable to side-channel attacks that can extract data from the Secure Enclave, and 2) SGX is a completely proprietary technology that goes against everything that free and open-source software stands for. Let me know what you think or if you have any questions."

I've been watching a lot of videos on youtube regarding how to pick a password manager (PM). But I still have questions cause some of the comments are confusing. If I get it correctly, it is better to store the database on the devices rather than cloud, but it's less convenient. I don't understand why clould-based is less secure. They say, my device sends only encrypted version of the database to the server of PM provider, so even if hackers hack their cloud storage and get all of our databases, they won't decrypt it, right? I mean, when these type of mass leaks happen, the hackers just sell it on the darknet to the ad companies or whatever, but why would they even hack a password manager if all of the databases are encrypted, they obviously won't try to decrypt every single account, right? It would probably take ages, no? Besides the encryption there's a complicated master password to every database...so who and why would even try to get it? This is why I don't get why it's advised to use a local PM and not the cloud-based ones. People mostly recommend KeepassXC or Bitwarden, plus they are free so I decided to choose between them but still can't make the choice. The first one has a local storage and the second one has their own cloud-based storage and it's open source as well. I have a laptop and an iphone, so in case of Bitwarden I would just use the apps, but in case of KeepassXC I would need to use apps AND constantly sync the devises via third-party apps (some recommend Syncthing). I just want to understand if such inconvenience is worth it. I've read some comments which mention that it's not secure to use the same device/account/database for both password and TOTP. They say, a lot of users do this mistake: in an attempt to log in to a website, they need a TOTP, which they get from their mobile app (for instance, Keepass' Strongbox), and doing so destroys the meaning of 2FA and converts it to 1FA instead. So there's no point in using integrated TOTP? What should one use then, a google authenticator? Cause I don't think I'm willing to afford a Yubikey or whatever it's called. Also, people say it's not safe to even access your database via mobile app for some reason, so it basically means one should not even use the mobile app? But how am I gonna log in to anything on my iphone? Also I don't get how to defend the database from malware and keyloggers on PC? Is there a solution to this? I've heard that the PMs have this huge vulnerability, I think it's autofill that undermines the security. And most PMs have a browser extension that allows autofill for the sake of convenience, and I've heard that some PM (Lastpass?) was hacked due to their browser extension's vulnerability. So I should never ever use an extension at all? And copy-paste the passwords from the desktop app every single time? Cause I have a cookie autodelete extension and It loggs out me from any account when I close the tab, without an autofill it's going to be a nightmare... Please explain all of this to me. The more I read about it, the more confused I get. Also, please, don't suggest me any complicated self-hosted servers and stuff, unless a complete noob like me noob could handle it on his own using a tutorial."

8,vulnerability,privacy,Are there any data encryption algorithms or cloud storage solutions that are quantum secure/resistant?,2,hdfnoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hdfnoi/are_there_any_data_encryption_algorithms_or_cloud/,2020-06-22 08:09:52,"**I am looking for storage encryption options that are ""quantum-proof"" (I guess more accurately *quantum-resistant*).** [Before anyone jumps all over me, yes I am aware that true Quantum Computers are still a bit down the road, and in some ways even still a bit hypothetical. That said, they *are* going to be here at some point - and if you buy into certain theories they are already in use at high-level agencies... - and considering that everything is being hoovered up and stored for later processing, it kind of doesn't matter if it's a few years, since your current day internet data is going to be subjected to the same kind of analysis eventually. Hence, even if it ends up being a Fool's Errand when all is said and done I'm interested in seeing what can be done proactively]. I'm interested for both hard storage on my computer at home, as well as cloud or remote storage solutions. My primary interest is on the latter, cloud storage, mostly because anything I store there is what's going to be transmitted over the internet and that's more likely to be captured and stored by surveillance entities, whereas things that are only on my machine, unless I'm being targeted which I doubt, aren't really going to be available to them ( that said, I still am very much interested in ways to securely encrypt your hard drive or other volumes in a ""quantum resistant"" manner). 1. Are there in fact any encryption schemes/algorithms out there, available currently, that really provide actual or even hypothetical protection against quantum decryption? If not, what is the best thing that would at least cause it the most trouble, the most secure if still imperfect. 2. Are there any zero knowledge cloud storage providers (I'm really only interested in E2EE stuff) that make use of any of the above-mentioned encryption standards? (I use many different devices, so ideally I am looking for a unitary solution that can function on a wide range of desktop and mobile devices. That said, the minimum standard is that it works, so worst case scenario I am fine with needing to use multiple different services depending on device/operating system, in order to get that level of security) 3. What is the impact on data-in-transit. I know that TLS for example is obviously not quantum resistant at all. Does this matter? On the one hand I could see that being a big vulnerability, on the other hand - this is a hint that I'm not an expert - I'm guessing that if something, quantum encrypted or not, is doing true zero-knowledge storage with client-side encryption that means the transit stuff is irrelevant since all the work is going to be done on my machine before the data is ever sent over TLS or anything? Or is this a bigger problem in fact? 4. If there are no good cloud storage providers that do this, but there is quantum secure encryption in general, what is the best way to implement this for my uses? Putting all the data in some kind of secure container before sending it to the cloud storage provider? 5. Finally, any good resources on this subject, even if not directly answering this question would still be appreciated."

If they werent doing that already, many schools rushed to do this during the pandemic. Obviously, these devices are typically installed with permanent extensions or apps, that ensure students are not navigating to inappropriate content on their school devices. The one that my school uses is called GoGuardian. I did a little recent into them recently, and learned that they were involved in a controversy over allowing school administrators to activate spyware capabilities, such as remotely activating students webcams. They claim this functionality has been removed since years ago. But, I decided to investigate anyways. First, I downloaded the extensions source code. This was annoying as the extension is force installed onto individual chromebooks, so I cant just query the webstore and download the crx. I ended up just navigating the chrome-extension://{extension_id}/manifest.json, then grabbed the names of the background and content scripts. After I had everything downloaded, I sent it off to my computer. After some brief deobfuscation, I began reading through the code. As Im sure no one is surprised, they didnt remove the spyware! There are multiple functions that allow a webcam stream to be started, a microphone stream to be start, screenshots to be taken, webcam photos to be taken, etc. Elsewhere in the code, I realize that these methods are called with no user interaction or agreement, remotely, from several servers hosted on goguardian.com sub domains. These sub domains have semi mocking names, like harambe, waluigi, and privacy, while others are more inconspicuous. To make matters worse, some of this is done over unencrypted http. After looking through the code, I noticed way too many references to student privacy. And after listening to sales pitches and viewing their website, I learned that one of their main selling points is protecting student privacy. That just makes this messed up on a whole another level! I also found a vulnerability in the extension that allows me to disable it, but I am unsure of whether or not I want to release this yet as it would likely be swiftly patched. Has anyone else done research into this subject? I feel like this is almost certainly illegal. At the very least, very creepy and immoral."
11,vulnerability,privacy,Disclosure: CVE-2020-13702: catastrophic breach of user privacy in Apple/Google COVID-19 Exposure Notification API,1,gv3kfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/gv3kfk/disclosure_cve202013702_catastrophic_breach_of/,2020-06-02 18:38:40," **Authors:** Daughter of V ([daughter-of-v@protonmail.com](mailto:daughter-of-v@protonmail.com) / PGP key DF20D21B349C2A9A) *Disclaimer: the authors of this document stay anonymous to avoid personal ramifications. The vulnerability has already been communicated to specific international media outlets in advance.* # TL;DR Apple and Google have joined forces to provide the Exposure Notification API as a secure baseline for contact tracing app developers. In their API release (currently in beta) they accidentally destroyed Bluetooth Smart Privacy, allowing seamless device location tracking. Adding current beacon network coverage and broken IoT security to this scenario, and considering the potential acceptance rate of such a technology, this might be an Orwellian nightmare on our doorsteps. This API development needs to be brought on course with international data protection legislations (COPPA, GDPR, PRC Cybersecurity Law, etc.) or alternative solutions should be investigated. # Introduction This document describes a critical breach of Bluetooth Smart Privacy introduced by Apple and Google in their COVID-19 support infrastructure called Exposure Notification. In a collaboration Apple and Google decided to tackle the difficult problem of enabling a global scale contact tracing app infrastructure while applying cryptographic means to avoid that user privacy is affected by this new technology. Numerous initiatives have been started early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to provide local solutions for digital contact tracing via smartphone apps. Most of them raising high concerns about the user privacy impact of such a large-scale apps. Rest assured that it left me with much wonder as I reviewed the specification released by Apple and Google and quickly stumbled upon what looked like a nuclear security fallout  the API spec effectively destroys the integrity of the Bluetooth Smart Privacy functionality established in 2015 by the Bluetooth SIG \[1\]. In itself this is already a fatal situation, but the Bluetooth LE context of the Exposure Notification protocol renders this even worse. The attack is fully remote, passive and without any need for device or authentication data access. This implies that the endless number of Bluetooth LE enabled devices world-wide are potential attack vectors, resulting in a convenient tracking solution of unprecedented scale affecting every user that installs an IOS or Android contact tracing app which consumes the Exposure Notification API. The vulnerability lies in the basic protocol design and as such does not need special exploit code. Any IoT device vendor stack is prone to undesired modification to enable this device tracking. Any Bluetooth LE chip vendor is able to add such tracking under the hood. This scenario serves as a good reminder why experts should be listened to when they raise concerns about such high-impact technologies. Given the escalation of the pandemic it is understandable why time is of essence, but rushing out a solution with such a fundamental detoriation to freedom and democracy everywhere is not how things should be. Technology iterates at lightning speed, but from time to time we need to hold on for a second and think about the consequences of our actions. The question why our devices communicate with hidden peers whereever we move  without our knowledge  is a different story for a later time. # Vulnerability The described vulnerability sits in the Bluetooth LE part of the specification \[2\] published in v1.2 at the time of this writing. The encryption architecture designates a 16-bit Rolling Proximity Identifier to enable the exchange of contact data between nearby devices without exposing the user identity to the peers. The details of the encryption protocol are not relevant for this exploit, it is only the identifier rotation interval that needs to be considered. The specification proposes that the rotation should take place on average every 15 minutes, which would be the duration within which a user is trackable by a UID. After the rotation the UID is refreshed which prohibits the identification across the rotation segment. In the same specification the Bluetooth Random Private Address feature of Bluetooth LE devices version 4.2 or later is recommended to receive a rotation set randomly in between 10 and 20 minutes. Bluetooth SIG specifies this MAC address randomization feature supported by the LE Set Resolvable Private Address Timeout command to prevent devices to become trackable \[3\]. The two differing rotation intervals create the critical flaw in this protocol design. Since both MAC address and proximity identifier are part of the public Bluetooth LE broadcast packeets anyone can intercept this data simply by placing a receiver within signal range. A malicious device network could easily store and correlate both identifiers to track users moving between the device locations. Both Bluetooth Smart Privacy address randomization and Exposure Notification identifier rotation work as expected independently, but anyone holding both data points can trace devices across rotations. *Fig 1. following the user identitity by jumping between MAC address and proximity identifier during rotations* This results in Bluetooth Smart Privacy getting broken in consequence. The Exposure Notification specifies an advertising interval of 200-270 milliseconds (presumably in an opportunistic manner). Due to the random nature of the rotations a collission of the is highly unlikely, thus resulting in near-100% tracking accuracy. # Attack vectors The vulnerability exposes the user identity both on re-scans of a single device and cross-device scans. Rescanning on a device does not seem to provide much leverage because the integrity of the encryption protocol still guarantees that no undesired data is exposed. The Exposure Notification specifies a scan interval of around 5 minutes (again in opportunistic manner) for API consumer apps, so the granularity is very low for the standard use case. Now a permanently powered device like a beacon can increase scan frequency to capture much more broadcasts. But even in a high-volume scan scenario the critical impact of this vulnerability only occurs when a single malicious actor controls a network of Bluetooth LE devices with central data storage available. *Fig 2. storing both identifiers for all devices in a fleet allows geographic tracking over fleet coverage* In this case the tracking potential is only limited by the coverage of Bluetooth LE devices within a controlled network. Note that many urban and commercial areas already see full coverage of beacon networks. # IoT security context In the assessment of this vulnerability the general state of security of IoT devices should be considered. The aforementioned scenario applies to valid Bluetooth LE device network operators, which in itself should not be allowed by Bluetooth Smart Privacy. The lack of a good security baseline of IoT in general, the numerous product/device variants, and the long runtime/lack of deployment lifecycle multiplies the issue beyond undesired network operator tracking capabilities. It is a likely scenarios that advanced penetration threat actors like nation states or high profile hacking groups can gain illegit access to Bluetooth LE device fleets. Near global tracking coverage for urban areas is theoretically attainable. # Proof of concept Due to the inherent protocol behavior creating the attack vector there is no need to provide a specific PoC implementation. A simple addition of the two identifier data points to a central store would suffice. In-the-wild device fleets possibly already include these data points in timeseries databases as they are often used for network logging. In both cases the location history for a device can simply be queried by hopping between the two identifier data points whenever a rotation occurred, and following through the fleet on device jumps (because the user moved). # Possible rectification The authors have not verified the other protocol layers in too much depth, but it would seem feasible to replace the rolling proximity identifier with the random MAC address (or an encrypted derivative) for devices supporting Bluetooth Smart Privacy. Since the API is backwards compatible with very old devices it is possible that the current rolling proximity identifier approach is also required to be kept for non-privacy enabled Bluetooth devices to ensure the integrity as proposed in the specification. # References \[1\] [URL \[2\] [URL \[3\] [URL"

And as of today, two new zero-day vulnerabilities.",1,fts5lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/fts5lv/the_zoom_privacy_backlash_is_only_getting_started/,2020-04-03 05:55:44,"[URL The popular video conferencing application Zoom has been having a Moment during the [Covid-19 pandemic](URL But it's not all positive. As many people's professional and social lives move completely online, [Zoom use has exploded](URL But with this boom has come added scrutiny from security and privacy researchersand they keep finding more problems, including two fresh [zero day](URL vulnerabilities revealed Wednesday morning. The debate has underscored the inherent tension of balancing mainstream needs with robust security. Go too far in either direction, and valid criticism awaits. ""Zoom has never been known as the most hardcore secure and private service, and there have certainly been some critical vulnerabilities, but in many cases there aren't a lot of other options,"" says security researcher Kenn White. ""It's absolutely fair to put public pressure on Zoom to make things safer for regular users. But I wouldn't tell people 'Don't use Zoom.' It's like everyone is driving a 1989 Geo and security folks are worrying about the airflow in a Ferrari."" Zoom isn't the only video conferencing option, but displaced businesses, schools, and organizations have coalesced around it amid [widespread-shelter-in place orders](URL It's free to use, has an intuitive interface, and can accommodate group video chats for up to 100 people. There's a lot to like. By contrast, Skype's group video chat feature only supports 50 participants for free, and live streaming options like Facebook Live don't have the immediacy and interactivity of putting everyone in a digital room together. Google offers multiple video chat optionsmaybe too many, if you're looking for one simple solution. At the same time, recent findings about Zoom's security and privacy failings have been legitimately concerning. Zoom's iOS app was quietlyand the company says accidentally[sending data to Facebook](URL without notifying users, even if they had no Facebook account. The service pushed a fix late last week. Zoom also updated its privacy policy over the weekend [after a report revealed](URL that the old terms would have allowed the company to collect user information, including meeting content, and analyze it for targeted advertising or other marketing. And users have been creeped out by Zoom's attention-tracking feature, which lets the meeting host know if an attendee hasn't had the Zoom window in their screen's foreground for 30 seconds. During the pandemic, a type of online abuse known as Zoombombing, in which trolls abuse Zoom's default screen-sharing settings to take over meetingsoften with racist messages or pornographyhas also spiked. Zoom offers tools to protect against that sort of assault, specifically the option to password-protect your meeting, add a waiting room for vetting attendees, and limit screen sharing. Some paid and free speciality versions of the service, like Zoom for Education, also have different screen sharing defaults. But in general the service doesn't highlight these options in a way that would make them intuitive to enable. ""It's as though, in suddenly shifting from the office to work from home, we didn't so much move the conference room into our kitchens as into the middle of the public square,"" says Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. ""Enterprise platforms are now seeing the same abuse problems that we've long been used to seeing on Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc. Those platforms were inherently designed to let strangers contact other strangersand yet they had to tack on anti-abuse features after the fact too."" Perhaps most jarring of all, the service has a security feature that it [falsely described](URL as being ""end-to-end encrypted."" Turning on the setting does strengthen the encryption on your video calls, but does not afford them the protection of being completely encrypted at all times in transit. Achieving full end-to-end encryption in group video calling is difficult; Apple memorably spent years finding a way to implement it for FaceTime. And for a service that can support so many streams on each call, it was always unlikely that Zoom had actually achieved this protection, despite its marketing claims. Zoom did not return a request for comment from WIRED about how it is handling this deluge of security and privacy findings in its product. On Thursday, though, Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan wrote in an [extensive public statement](URL that the company is pausing feature development so its engineers can focus solely on security and privacy improvements. Yuan said that over the next 90 days, that Zoom will also conduct third-party security audits and penetration tests, expand its big bounty program, and prepare a transparency report on data requests the company has received from entities like governments and law enforcement. The recent blemishes are compounded by the fact that even before the pandemic, Zoom had a reputation for prioritizing ease of use over security and privacy. Notably, a researcher [revealed flaws](URL last summer about how Zoom seamlessly joined users into call links and shared their camera feeds without an initial check to let users confirm they wanted to launch the app. That means attackers could have crafted Zoom links that instantly gave them access to a user's video feedand everything going on around themwith one click. The research also built on [previous](URL Zoom vulnerability findings. Zoom's gaffes have also started to invite even more potentially consequential scrutiny. The company is [facing](URL a class action lawsuit over the data its iOS app sent to Facebook. And the office of New York attorney general Letitia James [sent a letter](URL to the company on Monday about its mounting punch list. ""While Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices,"" the attorney general's office wrote. Given this track record and all the commotion about Zoom security in the past few weeks, macOS security researcher Patrick Wardle says he recently got interested in poking at the Mac desktop Zoom app. Today he is [disclosing two new security flaws](URL he found during that brief analysis. ""Zoom, while great from a usability point of view, clearly hasnt been designed with security in mind,"" Wardle says. ""I saw some researchers [tweeting](URL about strange Zoom behavior and literally within 10 seconds of looking at it myself I was just like, aw, man. Granted I research this stuff, so I know what to look for. But Zoom has just had so many missteps, and thats very indicative of a product that has not been adequately audited from a security point of view."" Wardle's findings pose limited risk to users in practice, because they would first require the presence of malware on a target device. One attack focuses on a Zoom installation flow that still relies on a now-retired application programming interface from Apple. The company deprecated the API because of security concerns, but Wardle says that he sometimes still sees products using it as a lazy workaround. An attacker who has infected a victim device with malware, but hasn't yet achieved full access, could exploit Zoom's insecure install settings to gain root privileges. The other vulnerability Wardle found is also significant, though still only a local access bug. macOS offers a feature called ""hardened runtime"" that lets the operating system act as a sort of bouncer while programs are running and prevent code injections or other manipulations that are typically malicious. Developers can choose to add exemptions for third-party plugins if they want to have that additional functionality from an external source, but Wardle notes that such exceptions are typically a last resort, because they undermine the whole premise of ""hardened runtime."" Yet Zoom's macOS application has such an exemption for third-party libraries, meaning malware running on a victim's system could inject code into Zoom that's trusted and essentially link the two applicationsallowing the malware to piggyback on Zoom's legitimate microphone and video access and start listening in on a victim or watching through their webcam whenever the malware wants. Wardle [confirmed](URL that Zoom had fixed both flaws by Wednesday night. Though it doesn't look like researchers will stop finding flaws in Zoom any time soon, the most important takeaway for regular users is simply to think carefully about their security and privacy needs for each call they make. Zoom's security is likely sufficient for most people's general communications, but there are more protected group video chat optionslike those offered by WhatsApp, FaceTime, and [particularly Signal](URL could be a better fit for sensitive gatherings. ""The reality is that companies are going to have mistakes in their software,"" says Jonathan Leitschuh, a security researcher who found the webcam hijacking flaws in Zoom last summer. ""The more criticism of a platform, the more secure its hopefully going to be. So hopefully Zoom is taking the information that theyre gaining and actually acting on it. But if you *need* to be secure and secret, I would not recommend you have those conversations over Zoom. Use a platfor"

28,vulnerability,privacy,How to reasonably prevent forensics tools like Cellebrite-UFED from accessing your phone's data,1,evu65h,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/evu65h/how_to_reasonably_prevent_forensics_tools_like/,2020-01-30 09:03:44,"Forensics tools like Cellebrite claim to be able to extract data from any smartphone. This is probably true for most smartphones. In order to deal with this problem, here is a small summary of my research to explain how to make it virtually impossible for forensic tools like Cellebrite to extract data from your Android phone. A small summary of encryption on Android : &gt;*Android smartphones released with Android 6 or newer must be encrypted once youve set them up. However, there are different grades of encryption. Many olded devices use Full Disk Encryption (FDE). In FDE mode, the user partition is encrypted with device credentials. The encryption key is based on hardware seed and a fixed password default\_password.* &gt; &gt;*Yes, you read it right. The data in your Android smartphone can be encrypted with default\_password. Does that mean just anyone can decrypt it then? Not really. The encryption key is generated inside the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based on a hardware-bound key that is unique for each device. That key never leaves the TEE. If you remove the memory chip from the phone and copy the data you wont be able to decrypt it without the TEE key. Therefore, one must not only retrieve the data (e.g. via EDL mode), but to also crack the TEE or replace the bootloader. Decrypting bootloaders exist; for instance, Cellebrite makes tools covering the entire chipsets. In other words, no access without the tools, but easy access with the right tool.* &gt; &gt;*Even if your phone uses the obsolete FDE protection, you may safeguard personal data by enabling Secure Startup. In that mode, the encryption key will be re-encrypted with a hardware key and your screen lock passcode (instead of the default\_password). This method has a drawback: the phone wont boot until the user enters the lock screen passcode; if the phone accidentally restarts, you wont be able to answer a call until the boot-up is completed.* &gt; &gt;*The above drawback is eliminated in new File-Based Encryption (FBE). FBE devices use user credentials (i.e. the screen lock code) to encrypt most data. However, the apps and some databases required for the startup are encrypted using device credentials (i.e. the hardware key). FBE devices do not have Secure Startup.* &gt; &gt;*Cracking the screen lock passcode is only required in two cases. First, the passcode is required if you want to decrypt information stored in FDE devices with Secure Startup enabled. Second, you also need the passcode to decrypt all FBE devices. The specific procedure may differ depending on the chipset, but the general principle is the same: connecting to the USB port and launching a brute-force attack.* &gt; &gt;*Decrypting FDE devices in standard mode without Secure Startup does not require the users passcode.* &gt; &gt;[*URL &gt; &gt;[*URL **So here's what you need to do:** * Install LineageOS 16 microG on an File Based Encryption compatible phone * Choose your phone [URL * Follow the installation instructions here [URL * I recommend phone with good community support such as Oneplus (recent models 5, 5T, 6, 7) or Nexus/Pixel. ***Wait! The LinageOS devs say microG is not safe!*** Not really, the devs of microG have already answered this question and put in place security measures. &gt;*Wait, on their FAQ page I see that they don't want to include the patch for security reasons. Is this ROM unsafe? No. LineageOS' developers decided not to include this patch for various reasons. The signature spoofing could be an unsafe feature only if the user blindly gives any permission to any app, as this permission can't be obtained automatically by the apps. Moreover, to further strengthen the security of our ROM, we modified the signature spoofing permission so that only system privileged apps can obtain it, and no security threat is posed to our users.* &gt; &gt;[*URL * Installing LineageOS and then fucking up your setup by adding over the Google GAPPS spyware is useless. It's the worst thing you can do to your LineageOS Android AOSP. It's like installing spyware in your Linux! * For your privacy and security, GAPPS should never be installed. LineageOS microG precisely provides an Android phone free of Google spyware while being compatible with applications that require Google's Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) services. * LineageOS devs don't want to offer a google-free Android out of the box because they are afraid of Google's reaction. ***But wait! When we install LineageOS we have to unlock the bootloader, it's even worse than using an Android phone with GAAPS installed! Read the article :*** &gt;*The encryption key based on hardware seed is generated inside the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) based on a hardware-bound key that is unique for each device. That key never leaves the TEE. If you remove the memory chip from the phone and copy the data you wont be able to decrypt it without the TEE key. Therefore, one must not only retrieve the data (e.g. via EDL mode), but to also crack the TEE or replace the bootloader. Decrypting bootloaders exist; for instance, Cellebrite makes tools covering the entire chipsets. In other words, no access without the tools, but easy access with the right tool.* &gt; &gt;*Of course, smartphones have built-in protection against such attacks. Qualcomm TrustZone and the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) only allow trustlets (small applets signed with manufacturers private keys). The Gatekeeper subsystem performs passcode authentication and limits the brute force speed at the hardware level to a crawl. As a result, even a four-digit passcode will not be recovered quickly, while a six-digit passcode can take years to break. The Gatekeeper also limits the speed of password recovery on FDE devices with Secure Startup as well as on FBE devices.* &gt; &gt;*As usual, there are vulnerabilities, exploits and workarounds allowing to bypass many of these security measures. As an example, older Qualcomm SoCs (up to and including Snapdragon 821) had a vulnerability allowing to execute unsigned trustlets and bypass brute-force limitations. Other vulnerabilities exist in modern SoCs, many of which are exploited by forensic analysis tools such as UFED or Oxygen Forensic Suite.* It is important to understand that **NOTHING** can protect you from an attacker who physically owns your phone, even if your bootloader is locked and even if you have all the existing hardware security mechanisms in place to date such as Qualcomm so-called TrustZone and the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Proprietary hardware security mechanisms such as TEE contain vulnerabilities that are already exploited by forensic tools such as Cellebrite. * You can NEVER guarantee that the hardware-bound encryption key inside the TEE (device credentials) cannot be extracted using 0-day hardware or even software exploits. * You can NEVER guarantee that the TEE's gatekeeper hardware mechanisms will limit the brute-force online speed of an attacker with physical access to your phone. * You will never guarantee that an attacker will not be able to extract a disk image from your Android to perform an offline brute-force attack without speed limit by bypassing the TEE's gatekeeper protections. * Even if there are no vulnerabilities at this moment, sooner or later some will be discovered. Never trust the hardware, especially if it is proprietary. So yeah, an unlocked bootloader will allow the Cellebrite-UFED tool to make a disk image of your Android and immediately start a brute-force offline attack without any speed limits or attempt limitations. **So even if the protection offered by a locked bootloader is almost non-existent as explained above, users who still want to keep a locked bootloader (and hope it will prevent a brute-force offline attack, good luck with that) should install GraphenOS instead.** Unfortunately there are few compatible phones. Logically, GraphenOS with a locked bootloader is the best option but when faced with an attacker who has physical access to your phone, a locked bootloader or any hardware mechanisms such as the TEE only offer facultative ""protection"". **The choice is yours.** The TEE is similar to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on computers. I would remind you that even Veracrypt/TrueCrypt developers don't believe at all in the ""security"" provided by the TPM. &gt;*Some encryption programs use TPM to prevent attacks. Will VeraCrypt use it too?* &gt; &gt;*No. Those programs use TPM to protect against attacks that require the attacker to have administrator privileges, or physical access to the computer, and the attacker needs you to use the computer after such an access. However, if any of these conditions is met, it is actually impossible to secure the computer (see below) and, therefore, you must stop using it (instead of relying on TPM).* &gt; &gt;*If the attacker has administrator privileges, he can, for example, reset the TPM, capture the content of RAM (containing master keys) or content of files stored on mounted VeraCrypt volumes (decrypted on the fly), which can then be sent to the attacker over the Internet or saved to an unencrypted local drive (from which the attacker might be able to read it later, when he gains physical access to the computer).* &gt; &gt;*If the attacker can physically access the computer hardware (and you use it after such an access), he can, for example, attach a malicious component to it (such as a hardware keystroke logger) that will capture the password, the content of RAM (containing master keys) or content of files stored on mounted VeraCrypt volumes (decrypted on the fly), which can then be sent to the attacker over the Internet or saved to an unencrypted local drive (from which the attacker might be able to read it later, when he gains physical access to the computer again).* &gt; &gt;*The only thing that TPM is almost guaranteed to provide is a false sense of security (even the name itself, ""Trusted Platform Module"", is misleading and creates a false sense of security). As for real security, TPM is actually redundant (and implementing redundant features is usually a way to create so-called bloatware).* &gt; &gt;[*URL **Trust only the crypto, not the hardware. Your ONLY protection is and will remain the complexity of your encryption password (user credentials)!** # 2) Setup When installing LineageOS, you must choose a screen lock passcode and not a pattern to encrypt your data. This is the user credentials. * Your user credentials MUST be a mix-alpha-numerics ASCII 16 characters long password (maximum allowed by LineageOS). * Such a password will have an entropy between 75 bits and 110 bits. * The keyspace (all possible combinations) will be 95 (approximately 4.4010 possibilities). * In other words, unless you use the most powerful supercomputer available today to make an offline brute-force attack on your password, the Cellebrite-UFED tool will never be able to decrypt your phone. **GraphenOS offers a maximum encryption password length of 64 characters, making any offline bruteforce attack impossible. LineageOS developers urgently need to increase the maximum password size to 64 characters instead of the current 16!** Each time your phone will reboot, you will have to enter the decryption password. * Once the phone is decrypted, the cryptographic key derived from your password (user credentials) will be stored in the phone's RAM. * To unlock your phone afterwards, do you constantly type your long 16-character password? Probably not. You will set another way to quickly unlock your phone once it has been decrypted. (example: fingerprint, pattern) The current problem is that LineageOS only offers the fingerprint to unlock the phone (once the decryption is done with the 16-character password). The fingerprint offers no security. If your phone is seized while it is turned on, the police will only have to use your fingerprint to unlock the phone! **The developers of LineageOS urgently need to provide :** * a maximum encryption password length of 64 characters (like GraphenOS) * a method other than fingerprinting to unlock the phone like patterns. The best combination would be a long encryption password (max 64 characters) + an unlocking method through a complex pattern (fast and usable in everyday life). * A complex pattern is 1000x more secure than a fingerprint if your phone is seized while powered on. * **But keep in mind that to ensure absolute security, your phone should be turned off when the Cellebrite-UFED tool is used.** * **Indeed, even if the developers of LineageOS finally adds a pattern-based unlock method, if your phone is seized while it is turned on, NOTHING can guarantee that the Cellebrite-UFED tool does not have an exploit to bypass your phone's screenlock pattern.** **Scenario 1 :** * Encrypted LineageOS phone with 64-character password + complex pattern unlock method. * Your phone is seized turned on. Police technicians will probably try to bypass the screenlock pattern using an exploit in the Cellebrite-UFED tool : * If this exploit works without rebooting your phone, **it's over**, your screenlock pattern is bypassed and your data is extracted. * If this exploit requires rebooting your phone, **then it's ok**. Rebooting will remove the cryptographic key from RAM and require them to retype the encryption password to decrypt the phone. If your password is complex and long the Cellebrite-UFED tool will never be able to access the data. Keep in mind that NO ONE currently knows if the Cellebrite-UFED tool has an exploit to bypass the screenlock without rebooting the phone (those bastards are silent about that). **So don't take any risk!** Turn off your phone before it is seized or before crossing a dangerous area (airport, customs, protests # 3) Let's recap * Install LineageOS microG or GraphenOS (if you want to keep the optional security of a locked bootloader) * Choose a long and complex mix-alphanumeric ASCII password of 16 characters (max on LineageOS) or more on GraphenOS. * Fingerprint unlocking provides no security. Pattern unlocking is better but does not guarantee that the Cellebrite-UFED tool will not bypass the screenlock if the phone is seized with the power on. * Do not forget to always power off your phone before it is seized or before passing through a dangerous area (airports, customs, control, etc). * Disable the USB Debugging option * If your phone allows to select the connection mode after connecting to a computer, select the Charge Only option. Otherwise, the content of your memory card, including photos and videos, could be copied from a locked phone. Check what happens after the connection. The majority of modern devices have the Charge Only option set by default. If the default mode of your phone is File Transfer or MTP, change it or forget about security. * Always update LineageOS or GraphenOS. Newer phones also allow updating the vendor layer separately. * Turn off the screen lock timeout on your phone to ""immediately"". * Beware of apps from unknown sources. * Never forget about the list of Device Administrators. Apps from this category may be used to remotely reset the screen lock passcode, lock/unlock the device, and revert it to factory settings. **(With LineageOS this problem does not exist)** * Smart Lock is an absolute evil from the security perspective. Disable Smart Lock including Face Unlock. **(With LineageOS this problem does not exist)** Don't forget that all phones even with LineageOS or GraphenOS have a cellular baseband modem embedded in the middle of the CPU with direct access to the phone's RAM (where the cryptographic keys are stored!). Basebands are proprietary black boxes intentionally filled with 0-days vulnerabilities. Nothing and no one can protect you from a cellular baseband that has access to the CPU and RAM. An attacker could even send invisible stealthy SMS messages to your phone to extract data from your phone via a 0-day vulnerability in the baseband modem because the modem has access to CPU and RAM. I don't know if this is possible or if it is already in use. If anyone has any information please share it. The only way to solve this is to separate the baseband from the CPU and RAM. Very few phones have a modem separate from the CPU/RAM. The Librem 5 for example solves this problem by isolating the modem baseband from the rest of the CPU/RAM. We have to hope that Librem 5 and the Pinphone will succeed, for the good of all. So keep this in mind and always avoid storing very sensitive data on your phones, even if they are encrypted with LineageOS etc..."
29,vulnerability,privacy,How I hacked hundreds of companies through Google Groups,1,ewbvxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/ewbvxc/how_i_hacked_hundreds_of_companies_through_google/,2020-01-31 07:40:47,"**GGvulnz  How I hacked hundreds of companies through Google Groups** ^(Source:) [^(Medium)](URL ^((formatted for easier reading)) &amp;#x200B; &gt;Google Groups is not only a privacy disaster, but also a security threat for many organisations. # Introduction This logic flaw is the lovechild of two previous reports: 1. [One](URL How I hacked hundreds of companies through their helpdesk  aka Ticket Trick by Inti De Ceukelaire. 2. [Two](URL Kenna Securitys research on the widespread Google Groups misconfiguration issue affecting thousands of instances, Fortune 500 organizations; Hospitals; Universities and Colleges; Newspapers and Television stations; and even US government agencies. I would suggest reading both as they are the building blocks of this one. &amp;#x200B; I was looking at the emails inside a companys Google Groups instance when I noticed some are related to various account registrations. My spidey sense told me to look up [Inti De Ceukelaire](URL paper, something I faintly remembered reading over 2 years ago. After processing that report again, I realized its actually relevant to my scenario. The Ticket Trick bug relied on the existence of issue trackers or helpdesk software that allow you to open tickets through email. An attacker had to sign up to the targets main service with a special email address, exploiting the lack of address validation (or circumventing the one in place) and log into the targets help desk service through SSO. In this case, all those components are simply replaced by the service of Google Groups mailing lists. Heres the sequence diagram of the bug: &amp;#x200B; # METHOD A) The method above works when the mailing list has the Anyone can view content. and Anyone can post. permissions. The first one is necessary for us to be able to see and open the email and the second is to let Slack (and other external services) post to the mailing list. &amp;#x200B; In the screenshot below the green text under the mailing list indicates that you have at least view access to the topics/emails. &amp;#x200B; How to exploit this logic flaw in a few easy steps: 1. Visit [URL and look for a public mailing list 2. Clicking the list will take you to: [URL 3. Visit one of these pages in another tab and enter this email address: $listname@$domain[URL 4. Refresh the mailing list from Step 2) and open the email you got from the service in Step 3) 5. Click the confirmation link (or copy the account recovery code, other \~6 digit code from the emails subject / body). &amp;#x200B; # METHOD B) Theres an other case when the Google Groups instance in misconfigured in a way that all mailing lists seem to be locked off properly at first glance, but search results disclose snippets of private emails around the search keywords. In this example none of the mailing lists have the green *#XY topics last post: $DATE* indicator, so we shouldnt be able to read emails sent to them.The domain owner is probably confident that unathorized parties dont have access to internal communication. &amp;#x200B; But searching for password for example, discloses sensitive emails: &amp;#x200B; Note that this is something that Google has known about since at least Kenna Securitys research back in 2018. Yet they decided that the privacy and security of their customers is not that important that anything should be done about it. Google Groups access controls are still as foggy as they were years ago.GDPRs [wiki page](URL says that Controllers and processors of personal data must put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to implement the data protection principles. I think Google should at least alert its customers when those appropriate technical measures are not in place. Compared to METHOD A), the steps to exploit are a bit different here: 1. You dont know the name of the mailing list that is misconfigured to begin with, so you first search for something that has a high probability of being in an emails subject or body, something like the letter a, hi or hello. 2. Hover your mouse over the groups name in one of the search results to see the URL it points to:[URL corresponds to the $listname@$domain email address. 3. Send a test email or directly a signup / password reset email from Method A)s Step 3) and hope that it appears in your search results, since you didnt have a chance to confirm the Anyone can post permission because you dont have access to the About Group page either. 4. Search for your test email to confirm that external senders are allowed or search for a string thats part of the target services signup / password reset email. &amp;#x200B; support@-, contactus@-, brand@-, [media@company.com](mailto:media@company.com) can easily be an (unwittingly misconfigured) public mailing list and also being used to sign up for Facebook, Twitter or Instagram since its convenient. &amp;#x200B; Password reset flows are usually nice enough to include the code / token in the emails subject or body so you dont actually have to click a link.Some registration emails also provide the option to copy and paste this URL into your browsers address bar if you cant click the link for some reason. As an example, I was able to join an organizations Yammer network purely through Google Groups search results. They didnt have View Topics set to Anyone on the Internet so I couldnt open the signup email or even see the email in the list of topics/emails (there was no list), but the search feature was disclosing private emails, thus revealing the Yammer activation URL. Fortunately, the GET parameters are not necessary for the signup process so everything after the question mark can be discarded. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Keep in mind that virtually infinite new accounts can be created with the same email address (mailing list):[list@company.com](mailto:list@company.com) and [list+123@company.com](mailto:list+123@company.com) are the same account on Googles side, but treated as different in Slack and other services. &amp;#x200B; # TOOLS ## [EdOverflow / googlegroups.sh](URL Ive used this script to look for public Google Groups domainsI noticed curl was following unnecessary redirects, so I could make it run a lot faster by changing the URL. Using Alexa top 1 million sites:wget [URL top-1m.csv.zipsed -i.bak s/.\*,// top-1m.csv./googlegroups.sh top-1m.csv I recommend removing domains that you know will be false positives to save some time. E.g. there are over 100 \*.lpages.co sites:grep lpages.co$ top-1m.csv | wc -l101 vim top-1m.csv:%! grep -v lpages.co$ZZ ## [maaaaz / webscreenshot](URL I needed a tool to be able to quickly check for vulnerable mailing lists. Google Groups HTTP responses are obfuscated and hard to read so I opted for visual recon. Scrolling through screenshots lets you quickly see the green text indicator. I found webscreenshot to be reliable, but in many cases the Google Groups pages didnt fully load before the screenshot was taken.We increased the default timeout for the PhantomJS renderer and added an option to change it manually in [v2.8](URL also helped in adding labels to the images in [v2.7](URL so you can quickly see the URL that belongs to the screenshot. ## [EdOverflow / contact.sh](URL Companies with a bug bounty program usually already have a private domain in Google Groups or have their individual mailing lists configured properly. Organizations with less security awareness are at a higher risk and ironically they are also the ones without a dedicated security contact, which makes it hard to communicate the issue. contact.sh was helpful in finding contact info for the affected domains.I helped to fix a [bug](URL with the security@ email address lookup. In some cases it took more time to find a contact info than it took to confirm the existence of the vulnerability.Companies above a certain size should be legally required to adopt [security.txt](URL and utilize a dedicated security@ email address. ## [emtunc / SlackPirate](URL You might think that sending a signup or password reset email to a mailing list used by  in some cases  hundreds of people is pretty suspicious, and an admin would notice and deactivate the accounts.This may be true, but an attacker can use tools like SlackPirate to quickly dump sensitive information (private keys, passwords, API keys, links to GCP and S3 buckets, link-only Google Docs, etc.) from the breached workspace using Slacks API.Once inside the companys perimeter  Slack workspace in this case  these type of things are generally shared without much regard to security or authorization. # Timeline **Dec 13th**  First report to a company with a VDP (vulnerability disclosure policy) **Dec 15th**  I realize this is a widespread thing and report the issue to Google (1st report) and Slack **Dec 16th**  I find one of Googles major projects to be vulnerable as well and open a 2nd report as a PoC for the 1st one **Dec 17th**  Google closes my 1st report as Wont fix (Intended Behaviour):*The decision to prevent signups on Yammer or Slack via email confirmations coming from public Google Groups should be determine (sic) by those providers and not Google. I would recommend reaching out to both companies about this issue.* **Dec 17th**  I comment on my 2nd Google report, emphasizing that this logic flaw completely bypasses Slacks [mandatory workspace 2FA](URL as well. I could easily set it up for myself when joining the Google projects workspace.I also asked Slack to consider having mandatory review of new accounts for workspaces where mandatory 2FA is turned on. **Dec 18th**  report to Microsoft (Yammer) **Dec 19th**  Microsoft closes my report, claiming that it relied on social engineering. :) **Dec 20th**  Slack closes my issue:*While the behavior you described in your report is quite interesting, we feel that this is a case where improved user education rather than a technical fix of some type would be a more appropriate action. Ultimately, users are responsible for ensuring that the domain they are using to sign up for their Workspace does not have a publicly readable email inbox.**You suggested attempting to check Google Groups itself for an existing mailing list, and while this may be a useful method of finding a potential target, its impractical to prevent such an attack at scale. Google Groups is certainly not the only existing service that can create an open inbox in this way. Surely youre not suggesting that Slack check every mailing list service on the Internet with each new Team sign-up to determine if its an unsafe email address?* **Dec 31st**  Google on my 2nd report:*Ive shared your submission with our team working on \[PROJECT\] to investigate this further. Since its a holiday period, we are expecting longer delays  apologies for that in advance!* **Jan 8th**  Google closed my 2nd report as Wont fix (Intended Behaviour):\*As I mentioned, we have shared your report with the \[PROJECT\] team for their review. Unfortunately, this is not a technical bug that would be in scope of our program and that is why we made the decision not to track it as a security bug.\***Jan 20th**  Publish this blogpost You read that right, everything Ive said so far is still in effect.By the way Google does have a category for Logic flaw bugs bypassing significant security controls in their [Vulnerability Reward Program](URL so this is not even a valid argument for rejecting my report. I left out Facebook (and Workplace), Twitter and other vendors from the timeline to keep it short, but basically everyone was blaming the users for having a publicly readable email inbox. # Am I affected? This vulnerability exists if your organization has at least one public mailing list and your Slack allows for signup with an [@company](URL email address or you use Yammer, Workplace, etc. Ideally [URL should show the following: &amp;#x200B; If it displays anything else, review your settings in G Suite and make sure that your publicly visible mailing lists restrict posting to [@company](URL email addresses or members only. Also, set your Slack workspace to use SSO (e.g. Okta) or make it invite-only. # Summary Having a public mailing list where you want to discuss topics with people outside your company seems to be a completely normal idea. Having a Slack workspace that allows for registration with a company email address is not special either. But sometimes you put two and two together and the result ends up being five. &amp;#x200B; &gt;Google Groups is not only a privacy disaster, but also a security threat for many organisations. &amp;#x200B; Google has unknowingly created an email service provider that can give free [@company](URL email addresses to the public and is not willing to take responsibility for it. Im publishing this in the hope that the publicity would push Google to mitigate the risk and also to help raise awareness.  ^(Source: Milan Magyar on) [^(Medium)](URL ^((formatted))"

Anyone who has travelled to and from the United States will be familiar with having to provide fingerprints and facial photos. In fact, according to DHS, if you don't want to provide biometric data, you have to refrain from travelling internationally. **Why should it** [**concern**](URL **you?** * DHS could perform advanced analysis of individuals in conjunction with other data sources. It's unclear what this consists of, what (self imposed) limits they have and how this will develop in future. * Securing data from hackers is tough, it wouldn't be surprising if biometric data from DHS is subject to a breach. * DHS shares the biometric data with other agencies and private companies, this further exposes the data. Links: [Quartz](URL [EFF](URL ## Ring Doorbells Had Vulnerability Which Potentially Exposed Wi-Fi Credentials [Last week](URL I wrote about how [Ring](URL doorbell photos were published to show trick or treaters during halloween. This week it turns out that [Ring doorbells had a vulnerability that potentially exposed Wi-Fi credentials of its owners](URL This could have allowed attackers to gain access to an owners Wi-Fi network, which in turn could lead to other security issues for the owner. The vulnerability was found by the cyber security company [BitDefender](URL It was reported in June and fixed by Ring in September. A similar vulnerability was found in 2016. **What is Ring:** Ring provides various surveillance products that monitor and film the outside (or even the inside) of peoples homes. Pictures and films are often shared within a community and law enforcement. The company is owned by Amazon. **The big picture:** * More and more people are getting connected devices, from doorbells that film actvity around a house, to sensors, to AI assistants that listen in on your conversations. These systems may have security weaknesses that could potentially expose data to attackers. Not only that, but the manufacturers potentially also have access to this data. * Ring has had similar issues in the past. * Ring products impact privacy of individuals around houses, these individuals are likely unaware of this activity.

These DNA profiles are stored by these companies. The company in scope of the warrant does not develop DNA profiles themselves, rather it's populated by users that upload their DNA in order to look for (unknown) family members. **Why it matters:** * The judge dis-regarded whether users opted out of police searches, in breach of user consent. * The search (warrant) was a broad one involving all of the DNA records, impacting a million people directly and millions indirectly (see next point). * DNA data impact is not just limited to a single person (e.g. of the person uploading their own data), it impacts family members who have similar DNA.

31,vulnerability,privacy,Can the ISP collect a master access key from every connected server?,1,duwyk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/duwyk4/can_the_isp_collect_a_master_access_key_from/,2019-11-12 05:55:29,"I'd like to start by clarifying that I'm speaking of something I head about briefly from a friend, hence why I'm asking to understand more about it. Please forgive my ignorance if I'm missing anything obvious here, and yes I'm aware this may turn out to be BS and not based on reality. Some background on what brought this up: Earlier this week I went to the Million Mask March movement for Anonymous in my city... not much of a movement since it was only 3 of us, but eh. I chatted with the organizer again who is the friend of a friend (my ISP). He has a bit of knowledge on tech, but is a man from the system who knows a few people high up with stories and knowledge on various topics (including secret services, spying and hacking). He told me something both worrying and intriguing: That in many countries, ISP's are required by law to collect the private keys of every server hosting content... which allegedly happens through an automated process at networking level. If this key is not collected, the internet connection won't even work until the ISP has it. The key in cause can allegedly bypass any password or encrypted transmission: When I asked he said that yes, it gives the government full access to any server if they want it, even if it's running over a secure HTTPs connection. This doesn't make much sense to me, but I figured I'd ask so I can learn about such a mechanism if it exists. I never heard of it before and have no idea how this could even work: The encryption is done between the server and clients... as long as there's no control over the software and it deliberately sends this data to a third party, I don't see how the ISP can obtain a private key from every connected server. I can only imagine some obscure vulnerability at networking level, but even so I can't think of what this key is and represents. Was there any truth to this story? Is there a master key delivered to the ISP when you start any server software, which can grant the ISP and government full access to your server? Do you know of any laws mandating ISP's to collect any server access keys in any form, and if so could you let us know what this key actually is?"

However, through my (admittedly casual) reading, it seems like the vast majority of reporting is on exploits found on Android devices, mostly down to the Google Play Store's less strict vetting process for uploading. Android 10 boasts a whole new array of permissions control from what I can see, but does that really matter if you're downloading a compromised app to begin with? On top of that, my opinion coming into this is that Google makes its money from sucking and selling as much data as it can, whereas Apple makes its money through hardware sales. This is an oversimplification, but my bias is to trust the mobile operating system of the Eye-of-Sauron company less than the We-Make-Overpriced-Things-That-Profit-Us company. I used to know a fair bit about Android versus iOS, but it's been about 3 years since I've had to think about it. Noting that the human on the end of the device is always going to be the biggest vulnerability, from an OS perspective, do you think Android 10 or iOS13 (and their associated ecosystems) are a more secure choice?

Hop one is your router, hop two is your ISP (unless you have a switch or your internal network has more than one hop to the ISP)... AND the fact that it's been proven with Edward Snowden's leaking of PRISM, XKEYSCORE and TEMPEST that the NSA and other agencies actively even still today have agreements with companies like Verizon (an ISP) and others - means that the infrastructure itself has been ""compromised"" (i.e. even Tor can't protect your anonymity in this case). I remember a story (having trouble finding the news source of it) where the FBI were able to track down an Anonymous hacker by comparing timecodes from ISP servers utilizing tor traffic and CCTV cameras in a Starbucks that proved his illegal activities were true. This actually worried me, as someone who feels somewhat comfortable and actually private when utilizing Tor. This comes to a single conclusion: **The only possible way to actually be anywhere near 100% anonymous is to bypass the compromised infrastructure entirely**. That's right. If a company were to setup something like cell phone towers, turn them into Tor nodes and link them directly to other towers as a relay node, then hop over the Tor network and then to your destination, would it not resolve this issue? Not that it is inexpensive to setup some kind of network like this, but I really feel like the only way to get away from such anonymizing breaking as was in the story I discussed above. &amp;#x200B; Thoughts? Discussion please? I have actually been seriously thinking of trying to start a company like this to combat what is the highly illegal and unconstitutional violation of Citizen's privacy."

41,vulnerability,privacy,Quick Privacy/Security Guide,1,c3am1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/c3am1z/quick_privacysecurity_guide/,2019-06-21 23:33:21,"I am writing this quick guide to newbies into the privacy/security/information security world who need a quick start. I have been researching this topic for at least 6 years now, and I want to share some of my knowledge here, not all of it, because that would expose my setup, but at least a general overview to get you started with. &amp;nbsp; # 1) Home Security/Privacy &amp;nbsp; * IoT/Smart Devices: I would recommend people to not use IoT and Smart devices, unless you are rich and have multiple houses, you can dedicate 1 of your houses to play with these toys, but if you have 1 house, I wouldn't put anything like this in my house. Perhaps if you have a big house with a garage, then you can experiment with these gadgets in the garage, however keep smart tools out of your **living room**, **bedroom** and certainly **bathroom**. This goes for smartphones too, keep your smartphone in your living room, and never bring it into your bedroom or other private areas. Consider your smartphone to be spying on you 24/7, so never bring it close to any of your computers, all it would take is to point the smart phone camera towards your laptop monitor while you enter a password, and your precious secrets are gone... **So a strict no-no policy of smart gadgets inside the private part of your house.** * Security Cams: I would not put any kind of security cam inside my house, if you must have one, put them outside the house and point them towards your garden or your entrance doors and windows, but never inside the house. Also research some local laws on this in many places it's illegal to point the camera towards your neighbor and things like that. * Alarm Systems: I am mixed about this, if you can get a good alarm system which works with motion sensors, then it might be worth it,although I would still keep them outside of the critical areas of the house: living room, bedroom, bathroom. But if you can only find smart-alarms that need the internet and the ""cloud"" then forget about it, that will most likely be a spy device that will listen to you 24/7 to ""catch burglars"". The motion sensors can be mounted on entrance doors and windows, so no need to bring the devices inside the critical areas. I might also put bars on the windows of your office room where you keep your documents and money just to be safe. * Home Safe: Get a home safe, everyone should have one, it's not expensive, although cheaper ones are usually crap. I would prefer a mechanical one not an electric one, but it's your choice, if you get one with a key, then hide the keys well. Put all your money, jewelry and personal documents inside the safe, but not your digital possessions (like data on a USB, I will explain later). The reason for this is I am paranoid enough to think that safes are not beyond cracking, so if a sophisticated adversary is after your data, then he can very well crack your safe. However if only a basic burglar wants to rob you then they might not be able to crack the safe, plus if your house catches fire or gets flooded, many safes are fireproof and waterproof, so it would save your cash and documents from burning or getting wet. So I would use the safe only to keep basic possessions in it but not digital data. Needless to say that the safe should be drilled into the wall and deep inside the house behind multiple doors that you can possibly lock if you go on a trip. My choice would be to keep the safe in the cellar drilled into the ground, that would protect it with 2-3 locked doors that an intruder would have to break before getting to it. * Curtains: Always use curtains on all your windows, never show anyone the interior of your house. I would also recommend people buying EM shielding curtains so if somebody wants to spy on your through IR cams it would block it. Also given that it's summer, it might also block sun rays and make your house colder. [You can brows for some here.](URL &amp;nbsp; # 2) Computer Security/Privacy &amp;nbsp; * Gaming/Misc: If you want to game then I don't care what you use, just do it on a separate computer. No dual boot or nonsense like that, it's not secure. Get a separate gaming computer and keep that in your living room. In your bedroom you should only have a secure computer where you keep your personal data, and never mix the two. I might even go to the extreme lengths to not even plug in 1 USB and plug it into the other, so have different USB sticks for different computers, even color label them to not mix the two. Treat the gaming PC as a malicious one, and dont contaminate your secure PC with it. * Privacy Computers: I would personally get a computer with EFI support and change it int the BIOS to EFI instead of UEFI. UEFI is a security hole like a swiss cheese. I would also avoid these modern signed schemes for boot where only signed OS's can run on the computer or disable those features from the BIOS if possible. FOSS hardware would be the ideal, but unless you have some money to spend on a [Talos PC](URL you have to settle for something less. I would personally choose an Intel CPU based one, but one with an ME version before 8.X that is an Ivy Bridge based one, after that the [ME becomes very hard to remove](URL Obviously [remove the ME with ME cleaner](URL So for laptop a [Thinkpad X series would be good or other ones that support coreboot](URL or a Desktop PC motherboard from that list, if you want to go extreme then get a Lenovo T420 which can be Librebooted, but this requires external flashing. I would also get a Raspberry Pi 3 as a backup computer, it has ARM CPU and it's more open source than regular desktop PC's, and it can be a good backup one for various reasons and can also be used as a flashing station if you choose to go with the Libreboot road. * OS: I would only use GNU/Linux based operating systems on the privacy computer. Again I don't care what you do with the gaming one, you should keep that separate and isolated, that is not concerning for this tutorial. You can put Win10 on that and play video games on it, just don't mix it with this computer, this one should be kept totally secure and open source. So just use a good enough and open source Linux Distro. You can [search here for the ones you desire](URL however here are a few of my recommendations: * For General Purpose OS: * Debian * openSUSE * Manjaro * [Fully Open-Source OS](URL * Extra Privacy &amp; Security: * Tails * Alpine Linux * Linux Kodachi * Qubes OS * Whonix * Hardening the OS: I would immediately harden the OS. Enable Hard Disk encryption at install (later it's very hard) and use 2 separate passwords here, 1 for the Root Account of the OS and 1 for decrypting the hard drive. Needless to say that all of this info should be extremely carefully handled and hidden. I would also immediately install a MAC system like AppArmor (I would no use SELinux for obvious reasons), and perhaps system vulnerability scanning tools, but only ones that are open source. You can also install ClamAV, on a Debian based distro if you want. Also install Bleachbit, to remove your metadata and cache files from the hard drive, it's not as necessary if you have HD encryption enabled but still good practice to have a clean OS. If you want to further harden the OS, [read and research these points](URL It would also be wise to replace all the applications in the OS with privacy friendly ones or configure them if they are not by default, just because the OS ships with a bunch of FOSS apps that doesn't mean that they are privacy friendly, most of them can have telemetry or crash report enabled by default, if you want extra privacy, disable those. * Integrity: I would always have at least 1 DVD with a secure OS on it, that I have verified cryptographically for it's authenticity, preferably a Live OS. So you can get 1 Tails or 1 Linux Kodachi or 1 Debian Live, burn it to a DVD, verify it's checksum, and then you have 1 reference point from where you can restore your OS, in case you mess it up or get infected. Linux machines rarely get infected since it has multiple layers of defense, however it's always good to restore your OS to a trusted one every 6 months. Like what I would do is just backup everything every 6 months and clean wipe the hard disk and boot the Trusted OS on it and download the new version of your previous OS from it, and then reinstall it. This makes sure that all potential or dormant malware gets wiped eventually, plus in case you didn't disposed your private files well, it's good to wipe the hard disk anyway to get rid of old sensitive data. So just have 1 trusted reference point to which you can always fall back to, and reset your system from it. Since Tails runs from USB you don't have to bother with disks most of the time, but I recommend at least having 1 version of it on a DVD, and verified. * Internet: * Only Firefox or GNU Icecat, [Firefox might also need some hardening](URL It's also recommended to use an adblocker (like Ublock Origin) on FF , HTTPS Everywhere and NoScript addons. * Get a good VPN for regular browsing, or Tor Browser or I2P for extra privacy. * Get a good FOSS firewall, like ufw (gufw), and block all incoming connections, block any outgoing port except 80 and whatever your system might use for synching and update checks, enable them on a need basis, otherwise block every unused port. * Get a good router, preferably [one that can be open sourced](URL and reflash it with a FOSS firmware, and connect to the internet only through the router, and configure it the same way, enable all DDOS protections on the router, block unused ports, IP and MAC filtering if necessary and all other security features if it has. I would also disable WIFI, bluetooth and whatever other radio systems it has and only use WAN cables to connect to the internet. Otherwise anyone near your house could hack it. * A good password manager like KeepassXC, you can also keep a list of bookmarks there, but I prefer with Firefox's bookmark bar which can be exported/imported. * If you are ultra paranoid, you can always just fetch data from the internet with the `wget` command routed through a SOCKS5 proxy like via Tor. Something like `torsocks wget URL This way you don't have to worry about javascript vulnerabilities and crap like that, if you just want to read some text on some website but you fear all the javascript stuff, then just download the file with wget, and then open it in a simple text editor or HTML renderer that disables javascript by default. For PDF files I recommend Evince, since it disables the macros by default so you don't have to fear the malwares from PDF files. * Backups: For backups I would never use the cloud, today's encryption standards might be broken with quantum computing, and most cloud providers store your data forever and hand it to the government and data brokers. So if possible avoid the cloud, but if you want to go with a reputable cloud provider, then still encrypt your data multiple times with different passwords and then upload it. I recommend Veracrypt for creating encrypted containers where you can put your sensitive data on it, and another layer of encryption with GnuPG with a different password, just to be sure. So you make a VC container with 1 password, put all your files in there, close it, and then encrypt the VC file with GPG again with a different password. Instead of using the cloud, I would buy a bunch of MicroSD cards and put it on them. For extra paranoia, I would encrypt the SD card again with LUKS with a 3rd Password, however it's probably an overkill. So get like 10 SD cards, copy your backups on them, and hide them around your house, or possibly at your parent's house or relative's house if you fear that your house can burn down or flood or destroyed by earthquake. An SD card would normally have a 50 year data integrity however it can also wear down quicker if you unplug it wrongly, or static electricity, or a magnet can all damage it. So either have many copies of it or find a way to make sure you don't lose your data. You can also back it up to CD's, however that is hard to hide so you should make a decision what you want more data integrity or hide it better. And also back it up regularly, weekly or even daily if your data and what you are working on right now is important. # Extra Notes: * The best strategy for privacy should be compartimentalization. Don't mix crap together, every tool and system should only run on a minimum need basis, and have access only to a it's minimum needs, don't give them more privileges and access than it's necessary to run it. This means no dual boot, not mixing the USB sticks and SD cards of your personal data with your public data, use color labeling and things like that to keep stuff compartimentalized. * Always make sure your data is portable. If you have to run away for some reason, be it an incoming natural disaster, or some other reason, always have your data packed and ready to go. So something like a backpack with your backups, DVD's and big enough to fit your laptop, so if SHTF you can just grab that and go. Never leave things to chances, because then you will make mistakes, you should be always ready for everything and safeguard your data. * Never reuse passwords, and change them on a regular basis, especially the ones that you use frequently, since any malware attack on a website could expose it. * Never reuse online usernames, and keep online identities separate as well, and compartimentalized. * Use cash instead of cards whenever possible * Don't give out more info about you than it is absolutely needed, don't sign up to marketing letters, surveys and things like that * If you have public Wifi access near you then you should use those often but only through a VPN + HTTPS connections, since Wifi's can definitely be honeypots, so heavy encryption is needed there. You should also randomize your MAC address when using Public Wifis for extra privacy. &amp;nbsp; ------------- &amp;nbsp; If you have any questions or you think I forgot something, say it in the comments below."
42,vulnerability,privacy,"Let's discuss Password Managers database management (local vs online), shall we?",5,c7smqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/c7smqj/lets_discuss_password_managers_database/,2019-07-01 23:34:05,"Hi, this subject arose in another post a couple of days ago, and I'll like if we all can have a nice discussion about how databases should be managed, and what advantages each approach provides, so new users (and perhaps some old ones) can learns something. Warning, probably wall of text ahead. When that subject appears, usually there are like polar opinions, and we often do not reach a consensus. Most often, ""local"" managed databases are seen as ""safer"" because they are not available online, so no one can ""hack"" the server and obtain them. They bust be ""physically"" stolen. ""Online"" or ""cloud based"" ones are seen as more convenient (since you can sync the databases across your devices), but less secure. But this is just it? Let's first set the bases: - Password manages is a trusted FOSS one (Keepas, Bitwarden, etc) with no flaws and considered ""secure"" by current standards. - Password protecting database is a high entropy one, +20 characters or long passphrase, again, considered secure by current standards, as bruteforcing it would take trillions of years on a high end cracking rig. Even parallel cloud processing cannot do a thing against a good password. - Local database is considered as a single location database. May it be on a HDD inside your computer, or an USB drive. - Online database is considered as stored at least on a server with permanent internet connection (be it a NAS or a cloud service) so it can be retrieved at any time as long as owner can access the protected service. - Threat model is not 3 letter agency, because if it is, user has probably already been kidnapped and tortured to death to provide passwords. :) Ok, now, about the user. I think there are mainly two types of user: The one that only access internet from a single computer and nothing more, and the other with several devices/computers that need a solution capable of login from any device at a said time. I think we all agree that like 99% of users belong to the second type. Right? Let's analyze cons a pros of each approach. - LOCAL STORAGE Main advantage is (as someone said me the other day): ""As soon as you can no longer touch your data, it's no longer yours."". So, keeping database stored locally adds protection, as it is not accessible for an online attacker, neither for the cloud provider to play with. Right? Unless your computer is compromised, of course. Cons would clearly be that you cannot have sync of your database among all your devices (irrelevant if you only use one, as I said before). You can mitigate this by storing the database on a single USB, and plug it in any computer you need, but you still cannot use them in phones, so this approach forbids you from login from phone. (Well, it can be done with some models, but we all know that is not convenient at all). Another con of storing Local that is often underestimated: Backup needs. If you store your database in a single location and that location fails (drive corruption, USB is stolen, etc) then you are effectively locked out from all your accounts, unless you have a backup. Since we are taking the ""not online"" approach, backup must be an USB drive, that you keep probably in your house (in a safe, maybe?). But this forces you to manually make backup copies of your database, which is a PITA, and is still considered as a single location for your database (your house). If you house is burned down or destroyed by natural disasters, or breached and stolen, you might lose both you main and backup databases. You can lose everything. Also, what happens if you are traveling and lose your main database (your laptop breaks or your main USB is stolen? You cannot access any service until you return home and retrieve your backup. - ONLINE SELF-HOSTED STORAGE In this approach, user has a copy of database in every device he needs to access to. Database is also stored on a NAS or similar device, that syncs database changes (if done correctly, keeping several versions). The NAS does not directly points database to internet (nextcloud or similar). Only updates inside LAN. Advantages: You can access your database from every device. Each time you update it, it gets synced among all your devices. Since the service is not pointed to WAN, it should be harder to obtain, as it is confined inside your LAN. Breaching inside your LAN is needed to steal your database (very HARD). You have multiple backups (on each device), so even in the NAS fails, you still have all the other devices versions. You are selfhosting: All your data is yours. Everything is stored on your devices, and can be managed (or deleted) as you like. Cons: You do not have database sync outside your house, unless you create an VPN, that allows connection to your LAN from your WAN, but this creates a point of failure. Still, much less attack surface than a full cloud sync. As before, all your databases are in a single location. If something happens on your house, you can lose everything. If someone breaches your NAS (assuming it is connected to internet), it can get your database. - ONLINE STORAGE Database is stored in a online cloud server (dropbox, Mega, Disroot, whatever), either as direct sync choice, or simply as a backup, accessible from everywhere as long as you have access to the cloud service. Pros are very clear: You can access your database from everywhere. Your devices sync the database in real time, and you have full geo-backup, as even if your house is burned down to ashes, you can recover your database as long as you remember your password and are not also burned down to ashes :) Cons: your database can now be considered as available to ""others"" (admins of the cloud service? government?), as you cannot control the access to the cloud service (you don't self-host it), you have to trust that encryption on your cloud provider is real and there is no backdoor. It is now a matter of trust. chances are probably slim, but you now can't know 100% sure that no one except for you can access the database. Ok... are you still here? Congrats! Do you agree with what I said? I think that now, the question can be boiled down to ""Do the advantages of keeping online copy of my database outweigh the cons?"" My personal believe is ""yes"". We already talked about how database is considered secure, as is encrypted. We are not talking about uploading a .txt with your passwords, we are uploading an encrypted file, as we do with cryptomator or veracrypt. We should trust that our encryption is secure (we chose an unbreakable password, remember?). Even if your government had a direct door inside your cloud provider (hint: is not as easy as that, specially if you choose a privacy concerned provider) they simply cannot break it (or at least, not without enormous resource expenses, which is not gonna happen unless you are targeted (and we assumed that we are not). Why are we scared to upload our encrypted password database, but we are not to upload our veracrypt sensible files? This does not make any sense. I can only think of this practice as being dangerous in case a day zero vulnerability is discovered (which is very very unlikely to happen in a FOSS), and even then, attacker would still need to breach into cloud provider (which is not easy, specially cloud providers, as they are very very security aware) to steal your database first... all before password managers programmers update your client and you update your cloud copy with a vuln-patched one. Sincerely, odds are very very slim, and the advantages they provide (specially off-site backup) probably outweigh the risk. What do you think? can we have a nice, polite interchange of thoughts? :) **TL;DR:** There is no TL;DR, it is not feasible, as there are lots of variables involved. If you are really interested, go and read the wall of text, you lazy bastard! :) In case yo are not interested, just jump to the next post and have a great day!"

I won't disclose my personal setup, but I always wondered what was better for overall privacy, Firefox Nightly with a butt-load of privacy extensions and many many about:config tweaks vs the Tor Browser. These extensions include everything from ad-blocking to anti-fingerprinting to NoScript to UserAgent spoofing to cookie deletion to... You get the point. I won't mention all of it since, well, it's private information. But rest assured that just about anything you can think of I've already taken care of in my setup. Even some novelty solutions for sort of obscure tracking methods are present in my setup. I've already verified even alpha versions of the Tor Browser surprisingly can't spoof/block some seriously identifiable information that my Nightly setup can on Browser Leaks. Don't take the Tor network into account. This is purely about the capabilities of the browsers themselves. Since Tor Browser (even alpha versions) is very ""outdated"" (yes I know ESR gets vulnerability patches) in relation to Firefox Nightly, wouldn't that be inherently in Firefox Nightly's favor, since it's updated on the daily, meaning code that wasn't even recognized as a vulnerability yet in ESR might already be fixed in the Nightly version? Aside from that, Nightly actually adds meaningful privacy-enhancing features like native cryptomining and fingerprint blocking, canvas fingerprint permissions per-website (of course I never allow it), advanced extension filtering for private window mode, etc. before any other Firefox version gets it (I do know some privacy features were inherited from Tor Browser). And also Mozilla is actively trying to oxidize Firefox, which I guess probably means Nightly has more Rust code than the other versions? If someone could verify that, that would be great. And keep in mind I've modified just about anything modifiable on Nightly that relates to privacy in any level to such the extent that, if I ever lost my Firefox profile, I would probably not be able to remember all the changes I've made. However I don't have the technical knowledge to verify the advantages of the Tor Browser on a deeper level since Tor Browser is a very different version of Firefox ESR with many changes, even on the way it's compiled I believe, and I don't know exactly what they've modified in relation to how it affects privacy. Would anyone that knows that information mind sharing it and if it presents benefits over Firefox Nightly?"

TD;LR: Apple is a PRISM/NSA collaborator.[5][4] &gt;The National Security Agency and the FBI are tapping directly into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet companies, extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs that enable analysts to track foreign targets, according to a top-secret document obtained by The Washington Post. We can also infer their real stance on privacy from the way they reacted to the newly discovered bug, which they knew about a week before it has been published, but failed to act on time.[6][7] ------ &gt; Apple insists that it doesnt gather your personal information to sell to advertisers or other organizations. Such a statement only goes so far  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg makes a point of saying Facebook doesn't sell users' data to advertisers, either. What the social network sells is advertisers' access to users, who brands can target with all the information it's gleaned from their activity. &gt; As for Apple, our iPhones gather up a lot of information, too. The GPS describes where we are, when we ask Siri for directions or a recipe, that request goes to Apple. Apple says it doesn't share that info with outside companies. It does, however, allow advertisers to target users based on their history in the App Store and News app. &gt; The company does admit that it freely collects information about what music we listen to, what movies, books and apps we download, which is ""aggregated"" and used to help Apple make recommendations. Apple says it doesn't share this information with outside companies, either and notes that it doesn't know the identity of the user. &gt; What Apple wont do, at least for now, is make it easy for you to get your data so you can check out what exactly Apple has held onto. Facebook and Google offer this service, via a download request that can take a few hours to generate. Then you get an email link to download it yourself and get shocked at just how much the social network and search giant has held onto. &gt; Apple hides the data request deep inside the privacy section of the website. To get there, its four clicks from the main page and buried in the 11th subhead on the page.[1] ------ &gt; That anonymization approach, he argues, tends to fail. In 2007, for instance, Netflix released a large collection of its viewers' film ratings as part of a competition to optimize its recommendations, removing people's names and other identifying details and publishing only their Netflix ratings. But researchers soon cross-referenced the Netflix data with public review data on IMDB to match up similar patterns of recommendations between the sites and add names back into Netflix's supposedly anonymous database.[2] ------ &gt; Ultimately, over time, this device-based strategy will prove Apple's undoing as it eventually admits it does need your personal data. It has accessed your personal data. And has done all along.[3] --------------------- 1. URL 2. URL 3. URL 4. URL 5. URL 6. URL 7. URL sorry for the mess "

Folks there assume Israel can read everything they communicate electronically. Let's discuss the most popular messaging app there: WhatsApp. I was under the impression that WhatsApp is secure if used properly.

But regarding the encryption itself... how likely is it that Israel can read your WhatsApp messages if you live in the Palestinian territories there?
56,vulnerability,privacy,CLIP OS: French NSA's Own Operating System Released For Public Use + 13 Questions,1,a1mrd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/a1mrd8/clip_os_french_nsas_own_operating_system_released/,2018-11-30 10:34:07,"More info: URL Github: URL It's also designed to protect from a malicious administrator. Probably very comparable to Qubes except you probably don't have to solve a minefield puzzle to figure out whether or not it's going to work on your computer, and it probably works on nearly all computers and not just 1 out of 30. 1. It says on the site that the distributions that have been tested to work with and that are ""compatible with the CLIP OS toolkit"" are: Arch Linux, Debian testing (buster), and Debian unstable, Fedora 28, and Ubuntu 18.04. What does this mean? Is it not it's own distribution/OS, but a ""toolkit""? It has to be combined with a Linux distro? I'm not quite understanding, as a person ignorant to Linux. 2. So, in the scenario where you have it paired with Debian or some other distro, and Debian or that distro gets an update, or CLIP OS itself gets and update, or Gentoo Hardened (which CLIP OS is built on) gets an update, or the Linux kernel gets an update--how are you notified, how do you install the particular update (of the four parties available), and how likely is it that your system will break? 3. Say you are running CLIP OS, and a new Meltdown/Spectre exploit is discovered. Who patches that Meltdown vulnerability? How would you know about the update? How would you get the update? 4. Can you use a VM in CLIP OS? For example, Debian+CLIP OS using a VM of Ubuntu? How would that be different from just Debian using a VM of Ubuntu, since CLIP OS is apparently not its own distro? (Forgive the ignorance.) 5. Qubes v. CLIP OS: which would you feel more secure with (also considering the teams maintaining each)? 6. What is the difference between CLIP OS and something like Fedora+SELinux+a VM, assuming you were only browsing the internet? Isn't the Fedora+SELinux+VM option just as safe in all ways? 7. What defenses, if any, does CLIP OS have against malware on a USB drive being plugged into the computer it's on? Or, say, a deliberate malware infection launched via USB? 8. How likely is it that someone eventually packages this into an ISO for download/installation for noobs like me who just know that they are going to screw up compiling/installing/whatevering it as it is now, and just want it to be available in ISO format? I'm not asking if someone here will do it, just the odds of it happening, which I assume are low. 9. Can it be used with xfce, KDE, Cinnamon, or GNOME, and have the desktop customized and ""riced"" and all that silly stuff? 10. Does CLIP OS have any kind of integrity checker or Intrusion Detection System built into it like OpenBSD has? 11. Let's say part of it, however virtualized, does get infected with malware. That malware stays there forever, unless it's somehow detected by the user, an AV system (next to zero chance), the malware author removes it, or your computer breaks or stops being used, correct? 12. Are all updates to it both signed and downloaded over TLS? What about updates to whatever distro you have with it, the Linux kernel, or Gentoo Hardened? 13. Should KVM, Audacity, Firefix, a VPN company's VPN client, Tor, etc. download and work on it just fine, as if you were downloading them on, say, Ubuntu or Debian? What package manager does it use? Thank you."

59,vulnerability,privacy,How am I doing everybody?,8,9ekgbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/9ekgbc/how_am_i_doing_everybody/,2018-09-10 16:36:41,"# Introduction: Recently I have discovered this subreddit. Before now I already had an enthusiasm for ad and [tracker](URL blocking. I already used [web wrappers](URL found on [f-droid](URL to message on Facebook. I even had a monthly VPN subscription that I tried to use as often as possible. Whenever I would want private browsing I would use a second browser for the VPN that had [script blocking](URL on top of the usual extensions. I quickly realized r/privacy would probably find my last 8 years of [Google Services](URL running on my mobile phone roast worthy. So with much reading on here and elsewhere I began my next personal project in life. My Digital Ark as I call it. The amalgamation of all my organized personal data encrypted and backed up externally. This would then give me the freedom to wipe my devices and reinstall everything from scratch with a new standard for privacy and security in mind. ## Part 1  The Backup: Basically I had two main systems to upgrade. The [PC](URL I built and have been using since 2016 and my Android mobile phone. Below I will quickly run through how they were setup before now. All backed up data will go into a folder I call my Digital Ark. The Ark is a folder with some sub directories for different types of backups. This included Bookmarks, Passwords, Contacts, device backups, account archives from Facebook and Google, etc All sub directories eventually got packed into encrypted [7Zip](URL archives. ## The Mobile Phone: My current phone has had [LineageOS](URL since the day I got it. As stated earlier it had a great system for blocking ads and was effectively cut off from Facebook most of the time aside from open source wrappers. The downside was I used many Google apps (Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Drive, Contacts, Calendar, Play Store). These apps were basically all tied to each other and Google Play Services and some other Google Services Framework stuff running on the phone. This means that I couldnt use any of those apps without them calling back to Google. Without Google Play Services none of those apps would work. So that meant Google was basically all or nothing. My LineageOS build was almost a year old and in need of an update and factory reset anyway. In addition to that I was not using any Android encryption features. This whole setup needed to be wiped after being backed up into the Ark. I recommend using [Titanium Backup](URL and if you are rooted with a custom recovery do a [TWRP](URL backup as well. These backups will then be packed into encrypted 7Zip archives on the computer and then placed in the Ark. ## The PC: The PC had telemetry/data vulnerabilities all its own. I have two storage drives. My primary drive is a 256GB SSD that had Windows 7 installed on it and my second drive is a 2TB HDD used mostly for media and backups. My second drive did and still does have a bootable [Kali Linux](URL partition but it contains no personal data and is generally only used to troubleshoot network issues. On Windows my concerns were that no file encryption was being used at all. On top of that I had come to learn [Microsoft pushed telemetry collection to Windows 7](URL through updates and [Chrome had acquired the ability to scan my file-system](URL with its malware detection through its updates. Telemetry collection was probably not nearly as bad on my PC as it was on my phone but the issue is that this PC had backups of all my data since 2010 stored on its 2TB hard drive. This data was from 4 mobile phones and two laptops. These updates were clones of the Users directories from Windows systems and full internal backups of phones. Not having all this externally backed up and encrypted when I realized how much I had hoarded over the years felt like a huge risk in the event my PC was destroyed or stolen. ## Part 2  The Upgrade: My goal was to get my privacy and security to a degree that Google, Facebook, and Microsoft can no longer access my hardware telemetry directly. Of course I will continue ad/tracker blocking into the future but I will add [Decentraleyes](URL to the extension cocktail to further reduce the use of any Google resources. On top of that I wanted all current files and web browsers encrypted in the event a hacker gains physical access to my devices. If I was going to go through the trouble of making my Digital Ark I was not going to bake in the vulnerability of my active workspace storing my web browser and recent files in [plaintext](URL form. ## The Mobile Phone: I started with my mobile phone. * I installed the newest LineageOS build based on Android Oreo and made sure to setup the encryption feature. I would like to add using a short pin will still leave you very vulnerable to a skilled hacker but it is easy to change your password. I would highly recommend having the forethought to add a strong password for times when you are traveling or in other situations you cant contest your device being cloned. Its simply too inconvenient for me to type in a complex pin every time I unlock my phone but it only take a few seconds to change it. * It was important to not give Google direct access to my phone so instead of getting my contacts back by the usual sync with google I imported them manually from a .vcf file exported from Google earlier. * The bookmarks and passwords that Google had also once managed for me where now imported into my Mozilla account. Since the release of [Firefox Quantum](URL there have been few reasons if any left to use Chrome. If you install Firefox on your PC with Chrome installed it will generally be able to import all bookmarks and passwords automatically. * [F-Droid](URL is the app store I installed to find open source apps to use whenever I could. * [AdAway](URL is great if you have a rooted device. It will block most apps on the device. * [HERE WeGo](URL has replaced Google Maps. It may not be on the same privacy level as [OpenStreetMaps](URL but I find it to be superior to Google Maps and it is German owned and its function is to serve the interests of car companies not as interested in entering the surveillance market. * [NewPipe](URL has replaced the YouTube app. I like to use the mobile browser version of YouTube to see my subscriptions and recommended and simply long press videos to get the option to open them in NewPipe. * [K-9](URL instead of Gmail. Even though I now have a [ProtonMail](URL account to begin migrating too I still need a way to conveniently manage the Gmail account. I found Google seems to block K-9 sending emails every few days to make me review activity because it doesnt recognize the device. I choose to take this as a compliment. * I also use [AFWall+](URL to block some apps access to the internet when I only need them for offline tasks. * No more Googling! I use [StartPage](URL now. Same results as Google but with upgraded privacy. Its the same company as [DuckDuckGo](URL but im not so much a fan of DuckDuckGos results. * I chose to keep Spotify but made sure to no longer have it connected to my Facebook and I updated all the [privacy settings](URL that only seem to be accessible via their web browser login. * For Reddit I now use [Slide](URL which is a very nice open source Reddit app in my opinion. * Ive chosen to use [Amaze](URL as my open source file manager of choice. * [ZArchiver](URL is essential for encrypting/decrypting 7Zip archives that are used for all of my backups. * [VLC](URL is my open source media player of choice. * [FaceSlim](URL is my Facebook wrapper of choice. I was first disappointed at the lack of notifications until I found [Notifications for Facebook](URL in the F-Droid store. Just make sure to turn off battery optimization if it doesnt initially work properly. ## The PC: Now that I had upgraded the phone and everything was organized and backed up into the Ark it was time to wipe the PC. Because my main drive is a SSD I will not format it as I feel comfortable letting everything get overwritten organically. If you see fit you can use an application like [Eraser](URL to overwrite whatever may be left in the unallocated space. I chose to do a dual boot of Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04. ## WINDOWS I fully understand the problems with using Windows on a privacy conscious setup but this PC is used for casual gaming and I have found many great tools to help clean up Windows 10 such as [O&amp;O ShutUp10](URL and [W10 Privacy](URL I wanted the Windows system to have no personal data of mine to manage but I often take breaks from games to use my web browser so I made sure to add a [Veracrypt](URL container containing [Firefox Portable](URL and a little extra space for any sensitive files I need to bring into my Windows environment. ## Ubuntu Im aware many of you have chosen Debian due to Unity in Ubuntu not being the most privacy conscious. I still chose Ubuntu because I found it was relatively easy for me to remove Amazon and tweak Unity. I recommend installing [GUFW](URL and turn it on and you can also go to the privacy settings and turn off the connectivity check . It never hurts to put on your tinfoil hat and watch a live capture of Wireshark with your web browser closed if you suspect something in the background sending out telemetry. Ubuntu 18.04 removed Home folder encryption but there are [tutorials on how to add it back](URL like I did. Its not easy to have a dual boot system and utilize Ubuntus partition encryption so I settled. ## Part 3  Hard Drive Backup (bonus step) After having everything setup just how I like it I shut everything down for the last step. Anyone experienced with Linux distros knows how easy they are to break. Also it takes time to reinstall all the apps and their updates. So I got my external hard drive and booted my computer with the Live Ubuntu USB. Normally to back-up a hard drives file-system its enough to use the [cp](URL or [rsync](URL commands but I wanted to save everything including the [GRUB](URL and [MBR](URL that are stored in the first 512ish bytes of the drive just in case. For this you use the [dd](URL command. It has been called the disk destroyer command so make sure to be very careful with it. If you cronenberg your partitions I dont want to be held responsible. After I cloned my hard drive I was left with ability to restore a fresh and fully updated install of my Windows or Ubuntu systems should they fail. # Closing Remarks: Even after producing this massive wall of text I feel Ive only provided an overview of this project. There were plenty of little roadblocks along the way. It took a lot of dedication on my part to work all this out but here I am on the other side with a PC and a mobile phone as easy and convenient to use as before but with major privacy and security upgrades. I appreciate if you read all this and Im always happy to receive constructive criticism."

I thought a lot of you guys on this sub would enjoy this. Excerpt from the first paragraph. ""Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have proven to us that we can trust them with our personal data. Now its time to reward that trust by giving them complete control"" The amount of the industry just blindly following everything these companies do just because they are industry giants is alarming. Aside from the obvious fact of the average smart phone consumer blindly handing over control of their data to a third party without a care or second thought in the world, I wanted to shed some light on what is going on with large enterprise in my world of IT consulting. The companies I have worked with are beginning to move everything to the cloud for their employees and customers. Giving up control of their data for cost savings and convenience being the benefit. Higher-up executives making cost-based decisions without weighing the pros and cons of moving critical business services to externally hosted shared server environments. Don't get me wrong, there are some services in business that are hugely popular to put in the cloud and make a lot of sense. For example, a company with 10,000 employees can easily manage a Sharepoint and Exchange instance in O365, it saves money and time for resources like this. But then you have ""cloud first"" strategies where executives are making decisions to move SAS, SAP, ERP, CRM, and Sales Force to the cloud. A lot of these business critical applications contain customer and employee private data. Without thinking about the impact of handing control over to other infrastructure, the potential for a catastrophic data breach is an obvious threat. That is not to say that on-prem hosting doesn't have security or vulnerability threats as well. Those threats do exist and private company networks are targeted on a daily basis. That is why it is critical to have a highly trained security and pen testing staff for large enterprise. It is a cost-benefit analysis of mitigating a threat. This is getting long winded now, but my TL;DR is this. Companies are blindly going to the ""cloud"" such as AWS, Azure, etc without looking at the downsides, attack surface, target size of AWS, etc. and instead are just making decisions purely based on cost. Lets hear your thoughts on this matter! Long rant, I know. But I haven't seen much discussion around enterprise here."

When one says an app or service is open source, I realize that the source code can be reached by the public, and the code is free to be used, modified etc. One of my concern lying on the first part, when the code is open to public, everyone can audit it, find problem or vulnerability. Of course it is good, but how can one be sure that the open source app, take Signal as an example, would summit to apple app store the same software generated by the source code exactly, is there any way to confirm? Because I think one of the benefit of opening the code is that, you do not need to trust the publisher indeed, you can verify yourself. But if there is a part of the process that the publisher can cheat, it just ruins the whole magic. And, says it is run on iOS or windows, if the code of the OS is not fully disclosed like linux, is that mean however robust the security and encryption the software is, the OS can still find a way to cheat, and there is still a ring in the chain of ""trust "" lying on the OS itself? just do not want to be paranoid, but suppose if there is some hidden agenda in iOS or windows, are they able to undermine all the hard work done be these app? I understand there is a difference between source code and binary code. But of any proprietary software like Lastpass or Dashlane ( of course they are both not open source, but not sure if they have disclosed their code, especially on the front end), the software downloaded on the computer is already the binary code at the mean time, if I access those vaults with a browser, at least I can right click and show the element, go through the source code, and while all encryption is done on the client side, making them no way to cheat ( I am not sure). is that mean using web to access is more ""cheat proof "" than using an app, on which you cannot verify unless they release the source code and leave yourself to compile? I am a bit lost here, on one hand, those ""zero knowledge"", open source and disclosed source with the webpage, do all the encryption on the front end is trying to tell the customer: you do not need to trust me, just go and check the code. but seems there is still so must Trust has to be paid on using those service, believing they will, and no other party would try to interfere them to (like the OS), uphold those claims.

Temporary fix: A) No decryption in email client. The best way to prevent EFAIL attacks is to only decrypt S/MIME or PGP emails in a separate application outside of your email client. B) Disable HTML rendering. The EFAIL attacks abuse active content, mostly in the form of HTML images, styles, etc. Attackers can change encrypted text/only emails to HTML emails.

Original: URL Some light reading: URL URL Apple does not state that Safari syncing data is automatically deleted after 2 weeks. The ""2 weeks"" thing that this guy is alluding to is completely unrelated. A company called ElcomSoft was able to expose certain data on Apple devices using a vulnerability which, as far as I can tell, resembles a jailbreak. When you delete history from one device, Apple keeps a ""hidden"" copy of that record for up to two weeks, so that all devices have two weeks to sync the ""hidden"" copy in order to learn that the record has to be deleted from the ordinary history. This is a shortcoming of iCloud which allows up to two weeks of *deleted* data to be recovered. I am suspicious of the fact that this guy never mentions in his series of a dozen tweets whether or not he ever deleted his history. So what do we learn from this? If you **opt in** to a service where you **upload your complete browsing history** to a company **for nearly a decade**, and then you **neglect to manually delete the data from the service**, then the service is not going to read your mind and delete history which you no longer want and which you **explicitly told the service that you want saved**. =============================================== Apple's privacy stance has enough issues that we can criticize it in an intellectually honest manner.

67,vulnerability,privacy,iPhone with cellebrite and mSpy - Apple refuses to acknowledge their Bug Bounty Program. What's the point?,1,8ot85h,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/8ot85h/iphone_with_cellebrite_and_mspy_apple_refuses_to/,2018-06-06 04:27:06,"Note: All of this is documented and pictures and e-mails have been saved in the event someone wants to help me and would like references. Long story short: I was overseas for an extended period of time (over 1 year). People would receive phone calls I did not make, I would receive text messages (on iMessage, Telegram, Whatsapp, etc.) that were not authentic. The iPhone was hacked without my knowledge. For clarification: the iPhone was never and never has been jailbroken. I informed Apple of this (including the vulnerability in the Wifi chip of the phone) over a year ago via e-mail to their product-security team. I never received a response. Upon my arrival back to the US, I went to my local genius bar. I was told by the head of the genius bar to have the phone examined by a law enforcement forensic analyst. So, I then spent over $500 to run a forensic analysis on my iPhone. At the time, it didn't occur to me that this forensic analyst was using cellebrite (or a variation of it) to inspect my phone. The analyst literally popped the phone into his equipment and didn't need a password nor any form of authentication to access my device. The analyst could see all recent activity on the phone (including deleted pictures, old contacts from eons ago, etc.) After this event, I was told to enroll in the Apple developer program to ensure I receive the newest security updates as quickly as possible (so, I had a DEV/Beta profile on the phone). This apparently still did not stop the device from being hacked. Fast forward to April of this year. I was using iMessage with the same phone....under the impression that my phone was secure. I screen shotted in real time my messages disappearing as I was typing them. I sent another followup email to the product-security team. No response after 2 months. I ended up calling Apple HQ and explained the situation. I was assigned a case number and essentially, all that happened was a hard reset under the guidance of security at Apple via AppleView. I informed the security specialist that the phone had mSpy previously confirmed on the phone, and in addition it was injected physically with cellebrite from the ""forensic analyst"" unbeknownst to me. After spending more than 6 hours on the phone with Apple with my case number, I was told that the bug bounty program only applies to people who have found a ""solution"" to hacks. I reiterated on the call to make sure I understood this correctly. So essentially, having a device that's had it's AppleID hacked, iCloud hacked, has been physically injected with cellebrite (etc), and while being enrolled in the Dev program, this phone does not qualify for the bug bounty program, nor does it qualify for anything else in relation to help from Apple HQ. I would like to ask, what's the point of the bug bounty program if devices that have been visibly hacked (as seen in the AppleView sessions), why does Apple not care to find the vulnerabilities in the hacked devices? There's literally nothing Apple can do except do a refresh wipe on the account and phone? The phone is still hacked..... To recapitulate: iphone --&gt; mSpy --&gt; forensic analysis (cellebrite injection) --&gt; AppleCare and Apple Sec do nothing. Where can I go for help with this? It's absolutely absurd that Apple doesn't have a program for devices that are compromised. If you're an innocent person who's life has been turned upside down due to spyware and malware from people with malicious intent against you, and Apple is so hardcore about the security of their products, I would assume Apple would want the device (or something similar to the bug bounty program). Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated. Thank you. "

That is not something I need to surrender for privacy and security reasons. Went up to the desk, asked the clerk if I could visit my friend. &gt; Clerk: ""We'll need to see your ID, sir"". &gt; &gt; Me: ""Why do you need to see an ID for this?"" &gt; &gt; Clerk: ""It's mandatory, this is the way everything is going so YOU had better get used to it."" &gt; &gt; Me: ""Yeah might as well put all on the blockchain too right?

Cold-stares emanating from the receptionist desk. *I will not be pushed, filed, stamped, indexed, briefed, debriefed, or numbered!*- I thought to myself... At least we can still text each other, I was able to text him from the lobby - but it's ridiculous. Also while in the waiting area, I observed the nurses toting around Windows 7 computer systems with all sorts of medical records easy for the takings if you were an identity thief. I also observed a weakness in the regiment that could perhaps be exploited. During a shift-change, one of the receptionists did not check for ID for a father and daughter. She just explained that she needed the visitors full name. Upon receiving it she said that although she allowed this guy through without an ID, she must tell her superiors that she *did* check the ID. So if anyone asks, she checked the ID. Nurse stations throughout the building reserve the right to card you, and she could loose her job.

As a part of this process, I've been reading through Privacy Policies. I am only considering online databases because I know my family will not be bothered to use something at all if it is not convenient (as such, ill-intentioned lectures in storing my information on the cloud are not relavent here). I am NOT trying to promote or demean anyone's favorite password manager. These are just things I noted while reading Privacy Policies. I thought it might benefit others to post my thoughts and host a discussion here. This is NOT an audit of the inner-workings of the actual software. Rather, it is a review of the statements made in the Privacy Policy as it pertains to the service and accessing that service. The Terms of Service, security practices, and company reputation are also NOT a part of this review, although in some cases I have drawn from (and noted) sources other than the Privacy Policy. ## Summary of Conclusions Below is an ranked list of how I feel the Password Managers faired. I purposefully did not ""score"" them, as I feel I have not been diligent enough to make 1-to-1 +/- compairsons. 1. **1Password** gets the highest ranking. Their policies can easily be summed up in their own words ""the less information we know about you, the better"". I found almost no negatives, and several positives when reviewing their privacy policy. 2. **Bitwarden** is a close second. Overall, they seem no more harmful than 1Password, but 1Password seems to have more strenghts (such as no analytics on the 1Password login page, which gives me more confidence in their commitment to privacy). 3. **Dashlane** lands in the middle. They are using analytics and tracking usage data, but this does not appear to be for the specific purpose of selling the data. However, it's rather unsettling that Dashlane reserves the right to use Anonymous Information ""_for any purpose_"". 4. **Keeper** initially intrigued me with their transparency of security practices, but the Privacy Policy is a little too cavalier with personal information. It is almost as bad as LastPass. 5. **LastPass** ranks the worst in my opinion. LastPass gives itself the right to track your personal information, lump it with other information they have purchased, _and_ share it with ad networks and third-party marketers. I feel that my password manager should not be building a profile on me. ## Details My notes on each Policy can be found below. I am paraphrasing in many areas. If you want to see the exact legal wording, you should read these documents yourself. The quoted sections are taken literally, and not meant to be ironic or satirical. \+ indicates something I found to be a positive aspect of the Privacy Policy. \- indicates something I found to be a negative aspect of the Privacy Policy. = indicates something I found to be a neutral aspect of the Privacy Policy.

So I run through the list of things I know of that could have auto-filled my address *and* the name of this random business that I've never heard of before, but apparently used to be at this address... * **Did my browser auto-fill my address?** *Nope.* This feature is disabled, and I already made sure my address was no longer stored in the browser ever since that auto-fill vulnerability was talked about a few weeks ago. * **Is there an extension that might have auto-filled it?** *Nope.* I tested it with all of my extensions disabled. * **Did the website geolocate me via HTML5 web API?** (URL *Nope.* I never got a permission request from my browser for this. * **Have I ever visited this site before? Maybe I forgot that I once gave them my address a long time ago?** *I don't think so.* I just moved to this address six months ago, and I'm pretty sure I've never visited this site before. Interestingly, when I visit the same contact form in a private session of Firefox, *or* if I use the Ghostery extension to disable all tracking scripts (there are around 18 on this page), my full address no longer pre-fills. Instead, it just puts in a nearby zipcode; I am guessing they use my IP address for this. So what I am guessing so far is that this company is able to identify me based on other tracking information, such as advertising cookies or a ""browser fingerprint"" from an advertising network, and they were able to cross-reference my address to the business name that was already in their database. I'm sure this kind of thing happens *all the time* at a variety of random websites I visit; it was just so creepy to see it used to magically pre-fill a contact form without my explicit permission. (Perhaps this is a deliberate, not-so-subtle demonstration of this company's capabilities?) If this is the case, I am hoping someone can help me identify which ad networks / tracking scripts made this happen so I can 1) try to opt-out of it, and 2) block it with Ghostery on any future web site visits. Im also open to other hypotheses for how they were able to locate me Thanks so much, everyone! I really appreciate your knowledge and expertise in this area."

What ultimately may have been stolen is uncertain, but the hackers clearly exploited a national vulnerability in cybersecurity: poorly protected email and barely any direct notification to victims. The hackers known as Fancy Bear, who also intruded in the U.S. election, went after at least 87 people working on militarized drones, missiles, rockets, stealth fighter jets, cloud-computing platforms or other sensitive activities, the AP found.

77,vulnerability,privacy,Honest Question about Password Managers,3,7lr757,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7lr757/honest_question_about_password_managers/,2017-12-24 08:33:24,"I am really new to the entire online privacy and cyber-security side of things, but I am looking to implement a password management system. I am a college student but also do software development work. LastPass is something I really think would be perfect in terms of convenience, and having all my passwords in one manager, but it also raises the question of how safe is all the data in LastPass's servers (as I'd assume with them being seen as the major target to being popped by anyone with mischevious intentions). The other option I was considering was KeePassXC (I am on Mac, Windows, Android, and iOS). The idea here is simply to use the KeePassXC file (database) sync via a Dropbox. However, I also wasn't sure how secure this setup is, as, in a nutshell, I'd assume Dropbox is often prone to attacks too, no? My goal primarily is to basically organize my online privacy, I know some folks rely on stuff like KeePass to be absolutely offline, but for me, that isn't viable as I am often remote and on multiple devices at times. LastPass potential vulnerability to being popped as it is a big target also doesn't ""sit right"", but the same goes for having my KeePass database file synced via Dropbox. What would you guys/gals suggest in this scenario I should pursue? I know LastPass isn't very popular here, but I have to assume it also falls under what your threat level is, and I'd want to say being a student, I shouldn't have to worry too much? If I should stick to KeePass, is KeePassXC is a solid choice, or are their better alternatives (as there seem to be multiple forks)? What kind of apps would be applicable to iOS and Android? And are there better (prefer free, currently have Box, OneDrive, Google Drive) solutions than DropBox to sync the KeePass database file? "
78,vulnerability,privacy,PSA: Update your Linux distros /r/privacy; massive vulnerability in Intel processors puts your privacy at risk...,41,7nxg8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7nxg8j/psa_update_your_linux_distros_rprivacy_massive/,2018-01-04 07:30:44,"This is really a security issue, but it is so serious that it could *easily* become a serious privacy problem. Its entirely possible that a hardware level vulnerability in intel processors could allow an attacker ring 0 access to your computer- this is worse than gaining root over the kernel. This is the type of exploit that can lay waste to the best security schemes, so please don't delay. The ""embargo"" period ends January 4th, and who knows what happens from there. I should also note this is not just a Linux problem- this affects Linux, MacOS, and Windows. The fix is found in linux kernel version 4.14.11. I am sure that distros running older kernels will probably backport patches, so get in your forums/irc channels/mailing lists and find out when. If you run an AMD processor you are **NOT** affected by this vulnerability, but you *will* pay a performance price unless you have the patch recently submitted by AMD. Recent benchmarks are suggesting a 5-50% performance penalty for the changes depending on task; this is because the operating system will basically have to use a software solution to a hardware problem. There are threads in /r/linux on this, as well as a number of news outlets covering it: URL URL URL URL **EDIT** Meltdown and Spectre are 2 of 3 exploits to be released. All CPU vendors are vulnerable to Spectre, but Meltdown (which is the one I discussed above) is intel specific *according to AMD, and seemingly accepted as true by Linux kernel devs.* I will update/edit this post as I find out more. FWIW most desktop usage will not see the gaudy 30-50% performance penalties that many of these articles discuss. From what I've gathered applications that require many syscalls are most heavily affected. Unfortunately, those of us here making heavy use of virtualization will see the biggest impact."

Unsurprisingly, most of them are pretty depressing, confirming what we all already knew: the year 2017 was pretty terrible on Facebook services.

My computer uses the VPN providers software, my phone and tablet use the OpenVPN for Android app, but as a consequence my other devices like gaming consoles and whatnot are left without any sort of protection. My router is a TP-Link router that supports L2TP in the settings, but I don't see anything for OpenVPN. Right now, flashing DD or another custom firmware isn't an option. So I was wondering what your alls opinion on L2TP is? I've read that it may or may not have had a vulnerability that has been cracked by the NSA, but we don't know for sure. My main thing is that I want to mask my traffic from my service provider, I'm no whistleblower or anything. If there is an instance where I need extra security I can always fire up OpenVPN Thoughts?"
83,vulnerability,privacy,Can anyone explain whether UDOO's Braswell CPU is immune to the Intel AMT and IME problems?,0,72396u,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/72396u/can_anyone_explain_whether_udoos_braswell_cpu_is/,2017-09-24 14:58:50,"I had not wanted to buy an Intel CPU because I had heard that they have IME and AMT, which act as backdoors to compromise everything. Then I heard that AMD has similar backdoors. (Then I heard that hard disks had backdoors, etc....) However, I saw a little bit of information that made me think that some modern Intel CPUs in fact do not have fully functional AMT and IME backdoors. If true, that would influence many folks' buying decisions. Here is the allegation: &gt;Short answer: Most of the ATOM processors such as the Braswell used in UDOO x86 do not have AMT capability, &gt;this include N3160 and N3710. I.e., case closed. &gt;VERY VERY Loooong answer (do not need to read and do not complain then) &gt;(1) view AMT as a group of technologies, main feature in AMT is about remote management (recent vulnerability found is related to remote management) &gt;(2) usually the client class (desktop, laptop) mainstream CPUs will use the same CPU/SoC's built-in &gt;standard Ethernet controller, as shared Ethernet port. If AMT is enabled in BIOS, two IP addresses &gt;will show up (one is the ordinary one and the other is the AMT mgmt Ethernet IP.) In server class &gt;CPU, AMT usually uses a separate AMT Ethernet port (if you unplug cable on that port, AMT feature &gt;is no longer accessible.) &gt; &gt;(3) In the case of Braswell such as N3160, there is no Ethernet controller in its SoC. The Ethernet &gt;controller is a separate chip: Realtek RT8111, thus there is no way AMT can even reach the Braswell &gt;SoC at all. &gt;(4) Intel has been using a separate microcontroller to assist the main CPU for years. It performs many &gt;tasks. AMT is just one of them, if the CPU's SKU supports such feature. Such controller used to live &gt;inside MCH (south bridge), later combined and moved into PCH (platform control hub), and &gt;nowadays, move into the CPU SoC package itself. &gt; (5) that microprocessor runs a special ROM code stored/burned-in inside the SoC package as well as &gt;used in combination with a special code section (protected and encrypted) of the SPI BIOS chip. &gt;(6) all these are Intel proprietary. Many had attempted to get into but failed. The one who succeeded &gt;won't talk anyway. Source: URL"

But Android is still a complete joke in this area. Couple months ago there was a big vulnerability discovered in bluetooth, now we read about even bigger vulnerability discovered in WPA2 Wi-Fi security protocol. And this is a big problem for all devices running 6.0 and above... Basically a hacker can easily monitor all your trafick a steal whatever he wants... It's a really scary thing and easy to do. - ""Google says that anything running the November 6 2017 security patch level will be protected"" And this is where the problem starts! - Most phones will never get the update just because OEMs already abandoned the phones... They are considered ""old"" or too ""cheap"" to worth the hassel of updating them. - My phone is Huawei P9 - a year old phone. It was their flaghip phone last year. It was expensive. And it's right now with Security patch from APRIL!!! (It's almost November now). And not hoping for an update any time soon. This is how Android OEMs work. They release a phone, take peoples hard earned money and this is it... Whey will probably push one two updates till their new flagship comes out and totally abandon your phone.. - Not sure if my phone has the patch needed for the Bluetooth problem... Most people will never get it for the reasons I already said... And for the November patch same thing. Most people will never get this update - so they are easy target and left in the wild to deal with it... Why because they didn't pay enough money so OEMs bother to give them a proper support (not like if you pay a lot you get something different but....) - Us with more expensive phones? We will get the November patch, probably next spring... Untill then we will have to pray no one tries to attack us... We store credit/debit cards, make online purchases, people keep sensitive info... But no one cares about their safety. OEMs keep getting more money and providing the same crap as always. Most people don't even know that they are easy target and this is the scariest part. One day the person is looking into his bank account and surprise - missing money! - They keep making billions but can's hire enough people to update their devices? Maybe too many devices? Not our problem! We paid for them! No matter if it's a $100 or $800 phone. If you sell it - support it! - Who to blame for this? First - Google ! They should demand from OEMs to update their phones every month with security patch! If not - just don't let them use Google play services! OEMs - for not giving a f*ck for us! For releasing 100 models every year! Release less - update faster! Two flagships / 2 min-range and 2 cheap phones are enough! People - for remaining silent and keep paying crazy amount and not knowing that not only the hardware is important! - Now unlock your phone - go to settings - About phone and see your security patch. You will be surprised how behind you are... Then tweet/post on facebook on your OEM page how much they suck for not providing such an important thing! &gt; P.S: I don't give a f*ck about upvotes but please give it Up so more people can see and find about in what danger they are!

How secure would you say locally stored, locked iOS notes are? I saw a security assistant from Apple write: &gt; Secure notes are encrypted by using a password that is required to view the note on iOS, MacOS, and the iCloud website. When you secure a note, a 16-byte key is formed from your password using PBKDF2 and SHA256. The notes contents are encrypted using AES-GCM. In another [recent thread of mine](URL where I asked whether or not I'm the only person who possesses the encryption key for my locked notes, I was told that there's no need to store a derived key anywhere because the key is derived from a passphrase, meaning it's likely that I'm the only person who can open and view my locked notes (assuming I haven't put them in iCloud). If Apple employees can't/won't access locally stored, locked notes, that really only leaves hacking as a vulnerability, but I've heard that the iPhone is pretty difficult to truly hack unless it's been jailbroken. And even if it was hacked, I don't think the hacker would be able to access any information that's been encrypted locally. So far so good, it seems. If you guys *still* don't trust Apple though and don't think the native Notes app is secure, I did come across an alternative - an app called [standard notes](URL The developer is very active and responsive and the development team seems like they truly have the best intentions for their customers - they even had a [third party audit](URL done recently - but the fact that the app is still relatively new and appears to be (primarily) created by one guy makes me hesitant to use it.

I am about to move, and am looking to get a new router for my apartment. For two reasons; - I want better performance than the regular consumer hardware + firmware offers, as I will always be running 1-2 encrypted VPN connections, and the overhead can get substantial. - After all the other privacy measures I have been taking, I dont want to leave an wipe open vulnerability for surveillance. In this apartment, all units have WiFi automatically, as part of the mandatory packages. It comes from a small (probably single-city) ISP - but good speeds. There is no modem, you just plug a router into the wall and go. *[I have no idea where the modem is - and I guess that, in theory the apartment management could have access to it, and possibly the traffic. Though I have met all the people who work here, and I doubt any of them know the difference between WiFi and Ethernet. Nonetheless, I treat all traffic that leaves my walls as public, so I always use a VPN or Tor+Bridge.]* I have heard a lot about running a regular router with a custom firmware such as DDWRT or Tomato, or something called Pfsense, or somehow turning an old computer into a router, etc? I am a little lost. I have no electrical engineering ability, so I wont be building anything from components, and unfortunately I have no space PCs lying around. So, what should I buy, hardware wise, and look to run software wise. I would be willing to spend up to $150, if it is worth it - but would probably avoid some of the unecessarily expensive consumer routers that are more simply because of non-privacy related or ""speed"" features (unless they really work/will help with VPN overhead)."

Apparently however, your unique browser configuration can be used as a fingerprint of sorts to ID you (or at least your traffic), even when you've covered your tracks elsewhere. Some people have reccommended ""anonymizing"" your browser - essentially having all the most common settings/add-ons in order to be harder to distinguish from the hers. Obviously this sacrifices the ability to take more active protection measures. Is there any data/experiences that point to which one might be a more effective privacy technique?"

These kind of occurrences cannot be predicted with certainty and can happen very suddenly. Starting from these facts, we started thinking about how to provide a solution to those people, giving them the opportunity to securely share critical informations with third parties, even while in prison or deceased: this is the main objective of the 3nigm4 project. 3n4 (or [3nigm4](URL is an open source project providing secure data storing and unattended sharing. Behind the scenes we have designed 3n4 to use PGP keys and AES encryption and to manage actual data and all critical metadata in totally separate files, passing through different processing flows.

While the security community's aim is more often focused on vulnerability detection, this project is focused on the solution: we are driven by the idea of providing a tool usable by anyone (not only by sec researchers or crypto fanatics) but featuring a security level able to satisfy both usage scenarios. All 3n4 services are available as docker images (official Docker Hub): *3n4auth: docker pull nexo/3n4auth *3n4store: docker pull nexo/3n4store *3n4cli: docker pull nexo/3n4cli Each image have a specific README file reporting specific deployment instructions and requirements.

Is there a fork of TrueCrypt (with Windows binaries) that *only* fixes the serious vulnerabilities identified in TrueCrypt 7.1a and does not make other ""improvements""? I'm aware of 6 vulnerabilities (4 from the audit and 2 from Project Zero) and maybe 3 of them are what I would consider ""serious"". In fact, given that my computer is not shared, I'm seriously considering going back to TrueCrypt despite these. Basically, TrueCrypt did everything I want and the main reason I ever switched to VeraCrypt was the local privilege escalation vulnerability in the driver."
106,vulnerability,privacy,Couple of CISA questions - does it apply to citizens living outside of US? And couple of others.,13,3xkb3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3xkb3g/couple_of_cisa_questions_does_it_apply_to/,2015-12-20 20:40:37,"I'm still trying to make sense of it so the above question is based on the next one: If I understand it correctly, by companies, they include ISPs right? If so, if I'm not using a US-based ISP, is it enforceable on that end alone? (Again, based on my understanding, they could enforce reddit to disclose my shit since it's routed through its servers based in US - but can they do that with Telnor/Telmex (the major isp company here), which would basically give them free reign on everything I've ever done online through them. A third question is - the bill states that it's directed at terrorist shit but if the info shared contains any evidence of cyber-crime activities those can be admitted along with evidence of.. anything physical.. So basically if I typed to my friend in privacy (free speech I thought), hey I just punched a guy - they don't need a warrant to use that as evidence of a non-cyber crime to persecute me for assault? Basically, does this part simply mean that anything and everything found can be used in court as evidence with absolutely zero warrant of any kind required should they simply suspect me of terrorist activity because I made this post and some disgruntled ex saw it and called in a tip or whatever? Or do they need some kind of a case or an investigation or a warrant or anything before they call up the ISP and say, hey, give us all of his records? edit: In case there is a breakdown of it already (I have only been able to find summaries) can someone link it? Or more specifically, can someone point at the section which directly targets companies like ISPs (if I'm not wrong about that part of it) or even just companies like reddit even if I am. [here is the link to the S.754 text that I'm looking at](URL but a lot of it is jargon that I have to keep looking up and references to other jargon that I have to keep looking up. I feel like this is one of those things I should definitely do a full read through/understand on my own though rather than just rely on summaries etc. edit: Been at it for 2 hours and this is the closest I found (still unclear about the isp issue/who releases the stuff and how that's determined.. everything is very vague). Hopefully someone can help clarify tomorrow. Anyway I found: "" (A) AUTHORIZED ACTIVITIES.Cyber threat indicators and defensive measures provided to the Federal Government under this title may be disclosed to, retained by, and used by, consistent with otherwise applicable provisions of Federal law, any Federal agency or department, component, officer, employee, or agent of the Federal Government solely for (i) a cybersecurity purpose; (ii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat, including the source of such cybersecurity threat, or a security vulnerability; (iii) the purpose of identifying a cybersecurity threat involving the use of an information system by a foreign adversary or terrorist; **(iv) the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, an imminent threat of death, serious bodily harm, or serious economic harm, including a terrorist act or a use of a weapon of mass destruction;** (v) the purpose of responding to, or otherwise preventing or mitigating, a serious threat to a minor, including sexual exploitation and threats to physical safety; or (vi) **the purpose of preventing, investigating, disrupting, or prosecuting an offense arising out of a threat described in clause (iv)**or any of the offenses listed in (I) sections 1028 through 1030 of title 18, United States Code (relating to fraud and identity theft); (II) chapter 37 of such title (relating to espionage and censorship); and (III) chapter 90 of such title (relating to protection of trade secrets).

Here, the language is so vague in the parts in bold and in italics it can be applied to anything by them. Like, Oliver mentioned how a bank robbery or something could be deemed a terrorist act since it disrupts economy, but here the language is even more vague. ""purpose of (...) investigating"" - this part refers to minors but any 'criminal' with any contact with children would include minors.. and since investigation covers everything pre-trial, you simply go ""I saw that guy with a kid once"" and now he's a cyber threat and that's that? I haven't read through I, II and III references under the bold part yet nor have I found where it says his ISP will have to immediately hand over all of his stuff but since everyone is flipping about it I'm sure it's there (would still like to know where), and so then I point to a guy I don't like, call in a tip, and he's done? I realize it's not 'that' simple but there have been numerous cases of shit going wrong with the bill Oliver mentioned and wrongly used and so on and this is like...

Sixty-two of the flaws were classified as medium risk. &gt;According to the report, the CMS agreed with all of the IG recommendations and began fixing the problems before the audit was complete. &gt;CMS reported that it remediated all vulnerabilities and addressed all findings we identified before we issued our final report, the report states. We have since reviewed the supporting documentation and verified CMSs remediation. &gt;The exchange site has been under fire from regulators since its disastrous rollout in 2013. &gt;A 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that health officials failed to implement best practices across the entire system, leaving small weaknesses that place sensitive information at risk. &gt;The GAO is expected to release another report at some stage this year about what it described as multiple cybersecurity incidents for HealthCare.gov. The system was apparently breached by hackers last summer, though according to reports, no consumer information was viewed or taken. &gt;We presently have work ongoing, looking at both the security and privacy of the state-based insurance marketplaces as well as looking at the incidents that have identified for HealthCare.gov by [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services], Gregory Wilshusen, director of information security issues, told members at a House Oversight Committee hearing in April. &gt;Approximately 10 million consumers currently rely on HealthCare.gov to buy health insurance coverage."

109,vulnerability,privacy,People are getting search and seizure warrants for reporting e-voting flaws in Buenos Aires,55,3c2v8g,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3c2v8g/people_are_getting_search_and_seizure_warrants/,2015-07-04 16:18:16,"Broad summary of what's been going on the last few days in Buenos Aires, Argentina (all links in spanish, will translate at request): - Elections are on Sunday 5th, July. - This is the first time an e-voting system is used in Buenos Aires city. - Researchers and IT professionals had been warning about potential issues with the way the system works (short summary at the end). - Government officials have said on-record that the machines are only ""printers with no memory"". There is video evidence that the machines are in fact standard PCs running Ubuntu. USB and VGA ports are located behind a lid on the side. See videos here: URL - Code got leaked about a week ago. Flaws were found. Code: URL - SSL certs got dumped due to security flaws. These certs are used after the election to send the result of each e-voting machine to the main computing center where all votes are summed up. This happened about a week ago. This was reported in the local media: URL (I can translate this ASAP if you need it). - A twitter user: @_joac sent this report (SSL certs getting leaked) to the head of development at MSA (Magic Software Argentina), the company that got the contract for the e-voting system (there was no bidding or public offering to pick the company, BTW). - On Saturday 4th, July a group of researchers published another vulnerability deemed ""MultiVoto"" (multi-vote, search for #MultiVoto on Twitter). Report: URL I can provide details on each of the people signing the report, and a full translation by request. For instance, Francisco Amato is CEO of a security firm: URL (Infobyte LLC). The MultiVoto flaw essentially allows for creating a specially crafted e-voting ballot that is counted more than once by the machine (essentially adding more than one vote to the count). As the ballots work with an RFID tag, the ballot can be crafted with any NFC enabled phone. The researchers claim they have PoC code that does this. The report got published right after midday on Saturday. A shitstorm ensued on Twitter and some newspapers published short stories about the matter: URL - Later on Saturday, a couple of hours after the report was published, @_joac got a search and seizure warrant in his home. All electronic equipment was seized. @_joac was not one of the people who signed the report. The community of researchers got naturally upset, as @_joac only reported what they had already found before. Article with quotes from @_joac: URL Another article: URL - Extra detail: the system was named ""Electronic Single Ballot"" system (Boleta nica Electrnica, BUE) by the executive branch of the city of Buenos Aires. This was done as a measure to avoid going through the local legislative branch as local regulations require that any ""electronic voting system"" go through the Buenos Aires City Legislature. This is considered by many suspicious. There has been a big government push to get people to call this ""Boleta nica Electrnica"" rather than ""Voto Electrnico"" (electronic vote). The PRO (the current party in power in Buenos Aires) has set up posts throughout the city to ""educate"" people about this. Many are now repeating that this is not an e-voting system. - There were security audits by a local University. None of these flaws were reported. Some speculate that the report was doctored. The way the system works: 1. You get the ballot from the local authority at the designated place for you to vote. 2. The ballot carries a printed number which lets the authority know that this is in fact the ballot that was handed to you before using the e-voting machine (to prevent ballot swaps). 3. This number is printed in way that by the time you get the ballot in your hands, half of it (horizontally) is kept by the authority. The other half stays in the ballot. 4. You get to the machine (which is in an open space, yeah, Van Eck phreaking), place the ballot near it and pick your vote. The vote gets set in the RFID tag of the ballot. At the same time, the ballot is thermal-printed with your choice. There are doubts about the security measures implemented in the ballots to protect it from long-range RFID readers. 5. You fold the ballot and take it back to the authority. The authority checks that the ballot id is right (with half the number the he or she kept). At that time, you are requested to cut the id completely from the ballot. 6. You insert the ballot in the ballot box. After the voting process is complete, authorities read the RFID tags of each ballot in the ballot box. The numbers are added up locally by the machine, and a piece of paper is printed with the count. At the same time, a technician is tasked with sending the count through a secure channel (SSL certs) to the main computing center. "
110,vulnerability,privacy,Financial Times Investigations: Cyber insecurity (about the US government),1,3dek6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/3dek6w/financial_times_investigations_cyber_insecurity/,2015-07-16 03:35:54,"Taken from: URL &gt; In July 2013, a hacker calling himself Peace uploaded a malicious string of code into computers at the US Department of Energy, the agency that oversees the American nuclear weapons programme, its power production and other vital national interests. &gt; &gt; Peace hit the jackpot, gaining access to a trove of confidential personal data  including the names of employees, their social security numbers and their bank account details. &gt; &gt; YASSSS, he typed in an online chatroom. I AM INVINCIBLE!!! Finally shelled mis.doe.gov after over 24h. &gt; &gt; Prosecutors allege Peace is Lauri Love, a 30-year old resident of Suffolk, England. With relative ease, he and his unnamed co-conspirators gained unlimited access to the system and ran more than 600 queries on the DoEs computers. The alleged hackers accessed the personal information of over 104,000 current and former DoE employees by breaking in through a known  but unpatched  vulnerability in an Adobe software programme called ColdFusion. &gt; &gt; Mr Love allegedly used the same tactic to infiltrate the Federal Reserve, Nasa, the Environmental Protection Agency, the US Army and the US Missile Defense Agency, according to three separate criminal charges. The DoE breach was one of the biggest violations of government employee data at the time  and the departments watchdog says it could have been prevented. &gt; &gt; The vulnerability exploited by the attacker was specifically identified by [US software company Adobe] in January 2013, Gregory Friedman, the DoEs inspector-general, concluded after investigating the hack. &gt; &gt; While serious, the breach at the DoE can hardly be called rare. Even as the US technology sector leads the world, the US governments computer systems  including those of agencies that handle information crucial to national security  are woefully unprepared for the frequency and sophistication of todays cyber attackers. &gt; &gt; US agencies vulnerabilities have been hiding in plain sight. Last week the Obama administration admitted that hackers stole the private information of about 25m individuals through two hacks at the Office of Personnel Management, the governments human resources arm. The second breach was the largest ever cyber attack on a US government agency. The OPMs chief resigned last Friday. &gt; &gt; Lawmakers see the rocketing number of hacks as evidence of a new cold war  one which the US is losing. Whether the attacker is a nation  China is thought to have been behind the OPM hack  or a small group like Mr Love and his associates, the enemy is often more sophisticated and more nimble than the US government. &gt; &gt; Mr Love, who has been charged by prosecutors in New York, New Jersey and Virginia but who has not yet been sought for extradition, could not be reached for comment. &gt; &gt; China and Russia have become more aggressive in their cyber attacks, prompting US defence and intelligence officials to express grudging admiration. &gt; &gt; You have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did, said James Clapper, director of national intelligence, referring to the OPM breaches. &gt; &gt; An analysis by the Financial Times of dozens of reports by agency inspectors general, the Government Accountability Office and the Office of Management and Budget reveals that for years more than half of the 24 agencies required to report their cyber defences failed to take the most basic security steps. Such measures include patching software holes, using strong authentication technology and continuously monitoring systems, to help secure the troves of data collected on employees, retired military officials and government programmes. &gt; &gt; A review of thousands of documents and interviews with current and former government officials reveals the deep challenges facing government agencies. Most agency officials did not return repeated calls to discuss the reports findings or declined to comment. &gt; &gt; One of the central problems here is you have old stuff that just was not designed or built in an era when we had these kinds of threats, Tony Scott, the governments new chief information officer, told Congress this year. &gt; &gt; The number of successful hacks of government agencies into highly sensitive information has been rocketing. This year, hackers accessed 100,000 tax accounts after breaking into systems at the Internal Revenue Service. A hack of the US Postal Service last year exposed the sensitive information belonging to 800,000 employees. The state department and White House said last year that their unclassified systems were breached, officials believe, by the Russian government. &gt; &gt; We have to raise our level of cyber security in both the private sector and the public sector, Michael Daniel, the White House cyber security co-ordinator, said last week. &gt; &gt; **Under siege** &gt; &gt; Since 2006 the number of incidents at federal agencies, including phishing attempts, malware attachments and unauthorised access by employees, rose 1,100 per cent to 67,168 in 2014, according to OMB. Some of that increase, officials say, reflects the better job agencies have done in detecting attacks. &gt; &gt; The entire nation is now making up for 20 years of under-investment in our nations cyber security, in both the public and private sectors, Andy Ozment, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Congress. &gt; &gt; The Obama administration has incrementally increased IT spending for the federal government from $78.6bn in 2013 to a suggested budget of $86.3bn for 2016. For 2015, the administration initially suggested cutting the budget by about 3 per cent before it was increased. Budget wrangling with Congress and a focus on cost-cutting add to the woes. &gt; &gt; Although more money would help, officials also note problems such as bureaucratic hurdles in hiring, a challenging procurement process and bad budgeting  tens of millions of dollars have been wasted on software upgrades that went awry. &gt; &gt; Tom Carper, a Democratic senator from Delaware, told the FT that two laws passed last year to give agency chief information officers more authority over their IT budgets would help make significant strides toward modernising cyber security. &gt; &gt; But Congress cannot rest on our laurels when it comes to cyber security  we have more work to do. Congress should promptly authorise and fund the latest generation in cyber defence technology to make future intrusions across our government less likely, he said. &gt; &gt; The outdated equipment often used by US agencies means that modern cyber defence techniques such as having a zero trust approach in which all users, applications and devices must be verified  now a common feature in software offered by companies such as VMware, Palo Alto Networks and Cisco  do not work. Encryption is also not possible on older IT infrastructure, such as the legacy networks at OPM. Its cyber security was viewed as so poor that in the week before the latest breach, its inspector-general recommended shutting down its networks and essentially rebooting. OPM declined. &gt; &gt; **An intelligence bonanza** &gt; &gt; Strong authentication is defined as requiring more than a username and password, such as a two-factor test using a login and security code or a personal identity verification card. This is now a basic procedure at many companies and is frequently used in free online services such as Gmail. Some agencies, including the state department, Labor Department and OPM, did not implement a two-factor test, while 15 out of 24 agencies failed to have at least half of their users in compliance, the OMB said in February. &gt; &gt; This statistic is significant due to the fact that major cyber incidents can often be tied to a lack of strong authentication implementation, OMB wrote in its annual report to Congress. &gt; &gt; The layers of old technologies, far flung operations and need for 24/7 connectivity present a host of security challenges, current and former officials say. Were trying to put a Band-aid on a carotid artery thats been severed, said an inspector-general auditor who identified flaws at the agency he audits. &gt; &gt; Many federal agencies do not even have a handle on the basics of their IT  as was illustrated by the DoE breach, where an employee deleted a data file rather than investigate the traffic produced by Mr Loves alleged hack. Government reviews found that many departments did not have a grasp of how many IT systems they operated. &gt; &gt; Even the Department of Homeland Security was found to have spotty cyber defences in some areas, especially at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, according to a December 2014 report by its inspector-general. Among other responsibilities, DHS has oversight of immigration and background checks on foreign visitors; it is also the federal agency that is supposed to help other agencies better manage their cyber risks. &gt; &gt; US officials say China gained access to the background records of 21.5m people, their contacts overseas, their friends, their financial information and their work history in the second hack into the OPM. &gt; Its an intelligence bonanza for the Chinese. Why there isnt more outrage tells me how far we are from fixing this problem, says Mike Rogers, a former Michigan congressman who, as chairman of the intelligence committee, was an advocate for improving cyber defences. It would take a serious effort in each [agency] to get this right, to revamp the technology, and it takes money. &gt; &gt; The US government, he says, has to be held accountable. If you expose all of these people who have voluntarily filled out these forms and put their lives out there you have some responsibility [to protect the data], says Mr Rogers, who was among those whose information was exposed. &gt; &gt; **A decade behind** &gt; &gt; Six months before Peaces alleged hack, a unit within the DoE identified weaknesses in the compromised software. But the agency put off spending $4,200 to buy the new version, the inspector-general found. The IG calculated the breach cost at least $3.7m in credit monitoring and lost productivity. &gt; &gt; Some agencies do not have clear lines on who is responsible for their IT, often meaning no one takes charge. And if improving cyber security interferes with the main job of an agency, those fixes often get put on the backburner. &gt; &gt; The risks and frustration with the lack of response to repeated warnings about security flaws led Steven Linick, inspector-general for the state department, which in addition to diplomatic relations has reams of data on visas and passports, to ask Congress for a proprietary network. I would like to be completely separate from the department to ensure the integrity of our system, Mr Linick said this year. &gt; &gt; The state department said in a statement on Tuesday that it fully supports the independence of the IG and its data and was putting in place additional access controls and encryption to reduced the threat of access by outsiders. We note, however, that establishment of a separate network in and of itself, will not mitigate all of the same threats the US government must now contend with. &gt; &gt; Robert Brese, who was in charge of the DoEs IT system at the time of the Peace hacks, bemoans the fact that the US governments technology lags behind that of the private sector. &gt; &gt; The government in many places is still several years to a decade behind the best and brightest in the private sector on legacy modernisation and the building of secure, resilient systems, says Mr Brese, who left the agency in 2014. I dont mean the Googles and Amazons, but longstanding companies like Ford."
111,vulnerability,privacy,Security review of the Anonabox - and it isn't great,16,32fbs1,http://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/32fbs1/security_review_of_the_anonabox_and_it_isnt_great/,2015-04-13 19:41:11,"I recently received a new Anonabox  one with WiFi security  and have performed a very quick analysis of the security. In summary, its nowhere near as bad as the first revision, but there are still so many mistakes and odd aspects to the configuration that I cannot possibly recommend anyone uses it. **Positive  all traffic is routed over Tor with no DNS leaks** Setting up Wireshark on the WAN side of the device shows that all traffic ends up on Tor. If the traffic cannot be routed over Tor, it is blocked. This means the device is performing the key part of the advertised functionality (even if, personally, I feel that Tor is not a good solution for the man on the street). **Positive  the WiFi is secured** The device has a 24 character long WiFi password and uses WPA2. This means that the WiFi side of the device is now secure. In reality, this is an excessively lengthy password, and not allowing it to be changed is a serious negative. Lose the bit of paper they give you with the password, and it is game over. **Positive  the root account no longer has a default password of admin** Looking at /etc/shadow, they have removed a password from the root account: root@anonabox:/etc# cat /etc/shadow root:*:0:99999:7::: daemon:*:0:0:99999:7::: ftp:*:0:0:99999:7::: network:*:0:0:99999:7::: nobody:*:0:0:99999:7::: tor:x:0:0:99999:7::: This is better. **Negative  running an open web config interface on WLAN with no password** For whatever reason, only on the WLAN side (i.e. not LAN), you can connect to the OpenWRT web config interface using the IPv6 link local address. Because the root password has been removed from the device, this means that the web interface now has no password whatsoever. This means that anyone who uses the WiFi can reconfigure the device. **Negative  running ssh server on a random port (but no way of logging in)** On the WLAN side, again on the IPv6 link local address, dropbear (a small SSH sever) is running on a random port. They have turned off password authentication, so only public key authentication could be used. There are no keys stored on the device, so there is no way to login. Why then are they still running dropbear? Dont run services you dont need. A vuln in dropbear could be exploited. **Negative  serial console access gives a root console** There are three pins on the board that allow you to access a root console with no password. A lot of embedded systems do this, but for a truly secure system, this should be entirely disabled, made output only, or at least secured with a password. I regularly see all three methods used on production boards. An end user is never going to use the serial console. This also doesnt align with the spin Anonabox are putting out  if you leave the device unattended you can no longer trust it. **Negative  use of public IP range for private network** There are reserved addresses for use behind NAT to avoid routing issues. For whatever reason, Anonabox instead uses 126.0.1.0/24 and 126.0.2.0/24. This is a range used by Softbank. This causes a number of issues  if you port scan your gateway, you in fact port scan a Softbank machine. If you want to access one of Softbanks machines, who knows what will happen with the routing (because, as and end user, you cannot inspect the routing and firewalling). **Negative  no way of an end user to confirm Tor is in use** Most Tor routers and Tor software has a UI allowing a user to confirm that traffic is, in fact, going over Tor. You have no way of telling if the Anonabox is working short of inspecting traffic. This isnt good. **Negative  no means to change settings or update firmware** This is probably one of the biggest issues. If we ignore the open web interface mentioned above, you cannot change anything on the device without using a serial console. If you ignore the serial console (because most people wont have the facility to use this), then you cannot change anything on the device. * Mistake in configuration e.g. firewalling  you are out of luck. * Serious vulnerability  no way of updating the firmware. * Lose your WiFi password  no way of finding it out. * Give your WiFi password to someone you no longer trust  no way of revoking access. This is not a good thing even if they spin it as a plus. A competitor, Invizbox, have already put out two firmware updates in response to feedback. **Negative  strange, non-standard MAC address on WAN port** The MAC addresses of all the devices I have seen begin OC:EF:AF. This doesnt seem to be registered with the IEEE, making it a strange choice. Beyond this though, plug this device into a corporate network, hotel, or anywhere else, and the network admins will instantly be able to tell you are using an Anonabox. On a device that is being pitched as so secure, it should allow the MAC to be changed or even randomised each time it is plugged in. **Negative  openwrt leaks NTP requests so you can identify a router is connected** Again, for a privacy/anonymity device, you often want to hide the fact you are using it from your carrier. When the box is plugged in, it performs the default action of connecting to an openwrt NTP server. Its obvious openwrt is in use  this should be blocked. **Negative  the config is all over the place** The whole thing is an openwrt router with some minor config changes. The changes that have been made seem amateurish and inconsistent. They are clearly not experts at this. **Conclusion** It kind of does what it should do, but does so many bits so badly that there is no way I would trust or recommend it. Its a given that manufacturers will make mistakes. Anonabox have made mistakes. One of those mistakes is making it impossible to fix the mistakes they have made.

It makes since it would protect from heartbleed because DNS is not being transmitted via SSL. But am I right? I have DNSCrypt proxy connected to okTurtles currently running on my router. I was just wondering what security advantages I am really receiving besides just hiding my DNS from my ISP. 2. My understanding of DNSCrypt is that it protects your DNS from your ISP. But couldnt your ISP do reverse DNS and see what sites you are locating anyways?? I realize DNSCrypt makes it much more difficult to block sites since this is done by DNS, but wouldnt it be very easy to trace browsing activity by examining IP addresses? Thanks for the help guys! "

I am currently having a though experiment of how to get the best possible secure online environment for e.g. journalists who want to leak information, or just to generally find a way to be truly anonymous in the digital world. I am aware that there is no such thing as 'absolute' security, but 99% would be fine in most cases  ____________________________ My thoughts so far. Open for discussion and suggestions. Hardware needed: 1. Need to find a used notebook and buy it cash. The communication with the seller is needs to be non-digital like a backyard sale, flea market or just from a small electronics store (bonus points for a store without a security camera). Because every computer device has a burned-in hardware identification number (MAC-Number). 2. Need to find a prepaid, preregistered SIM-Card. In my country (EU) it is illegal to sell preregistered SIM-Cards. People need to register the SIM-Cards with their ID-Card, but I found that in bigger cities there are shops inside or nearby Train stations or Airports who still sell them for tourists which need fast access to SIM-Cards to call home after arrival. 3. Need to find a USB modem for the SIM-Card, also bought cash. Now that we have our hardware, we get to the software steps: 4. We need a VPN service. Preferably with servers in a country with strict privacy laws like Switzerland or Sweden. There are several VPNs which can be paid anonymously trough cash. Either buying a activation-code in a store by cash or just sending cash by mail to the VPN provider for a registration without a bank transfer trace. 5. Anonymous fake eMail addresses preferably with servers in a country with strict privacy laws like Switzerland or Sweden (or temporary eMail addresses if the online service allows it). 6. All passwords used should be different for each service and account, long with special letters, generated random from a computer and also randomly changed by a human. It can be written down somewhere since it's too hard to remember, but maybe additionally write some special letter in between which you know are not used. 7. In case the computer is going to get raided some day it should be encrypted. With a mac e.g FileVault. 8. For browsing using the software TOR with plugins like 'HTTPS everywhere', 'Disable WebRTC' and 'User-Agent Switcher'. ____________________________ That is so far what I got, need more input. Should a 'Guest account' be used for login into the computer so that the files and everything are going to be erased after each session? One vulnerability I can see already is that IF your VPN provider is going to give up your actual IP-Address, the position of the USB-SIM-Modem could be tracked trough cellular triangulation. In this case there might be a solution to having a mobile phone powered by solar panels positioned in a different city working as a transit spot for data. But this would significantly add to the costs and effort to the whole thing. Also I am not familiar with DNS Service security, could anyone explain if there is a security risk and how to solve it? ____________________________ Thanks for reading "

That data spilled online  TechCrunch,1,hiid7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/hiid7j/oracles_bluekai_tracks_you_across_the_web_that/,2020-06-30 17:11:54,"# Included article for those wanting to avoid all the trackers from a website that always tracks you about a company that has mastered all the trackers # Oracles BlueKai tracks you across the web. That data spilled online  TechCrunch Zack Whittaker@zackwhittaker / 2:30 pm GMTJune 19, 2020 Have you ever wondered why online ads appear for things that you were just thinking about? Theres no big conspiracy. Ad tech can be creepily accurate. Tech giant Oracle is one of a few companies in Silicon Valley that has near-perfected the art of tracking people across the internet. The company has spent a decade and billions of dollars buying startups to build its [very own panopticon](URL of users web browsing data. One of those startups, [BlueKai, ](URL which Oracle bought [for a little over $400 million](URL in 2014, is barely known outside marketing circles, but it amassed one of the largest banks of web tracking data outside of the federal government. BlueKai uses website cookies and other tracking tech to follow you around the web. By knowing which websites you visit and which emails you open, marketers can use this vast amount of tracking data to infer as much about you as possible  your income, education, political views, and interests to name a few  in order to target you with ads that should match your apparent tastes. If you click, the advertisers make money. But for a time, that web tracking data was spilling out onto the open internet because a server was left unsecured and without a password, exposing billions of records for anyone to find. Security researcher [Anurag Sen](URL found the database and reported his finding to Oracle through an intermediary  Roi Carthy, chief executive at cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock and [former TechCrunch reporter](URL TechCrunch reviewed the data shared by Sen and found names, home addresses, email addresses and other identifiable data in the database. The data also revealed sensitive users web browsing activity  from purchases to newsletter unsubscribes. Theres really no telling how revealing some of this data can be, said Bennett Cyphers, a staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told TechCrunch. Oracle is aware of the report made by Roi Carthy of Hudson Rock related to certain BlueKai records potentially exposed on the Internet, said Oracle spokesperson Deborah Hellinger. While the initial information provided by the researcher did not contain enough information to identify an affected system, Oracles investigation has subsequently determined that two companies did not properly configure their services. Oracle has taken additional measures to avoid a reoccurrence of this issue. Oracle did not name the companies or say what those additional measures were, and declined to answer our questions or comment further. But the sheer size of the exposed database makes this one of the largest security lapses this year. ## The more it knows BlueKai relies on vacuuming up a never-ending supply of data from a variety of sources to understand trends to deliver the most precise ads to a persons interests. Marketers can either tap into Oracles enormous bank of data, which it pulls in from credit agencies, analytics firms, and other sources of consumer data including [billions of daily location data points](URL in order to target their ads. Or marketers can upload their own data obtained directly from consumers, such as [the information you hand over](URL when you register an account on a website or when you sign up for a companys newsletter. But BlueKai also uses more covert tactics like allowing websites to embed invisible pixel-sized images to collect information about you as soon as you open the page  hardware, operating system, browser and any information about the network connection. This data  known as a web browsers user agent  may not seem sensitive, but when fused together it can create a unique fingerprint of a persons device, which can be used to track that person as they browse the internet. BlueKai can also tie your mobile web browsing habits to your desktop activity, allowing it to [follow you across the internet](URL no matter which device you use. Say a marketer wants to run a campaign trying to sell a new car model. In BlueKais case, it already has a category of car enthusiasts  and many other, more specific categories  that the marketer can use to target with ads. Anyone whos visited a car makers website or a blog that includes a BlueKai tracking pixel might be categorized as a car enthusiast. Over time that person will be siloed into different categories under a profile that learns as much about you to target you with those ads. The technology is far from perfect. Harvard Business Review found earlier this year that the information collected by data brokers, such as Oracle, can [vary wildly](URL in quality. But some of these platforms have proven alarmingly accurate. In 2012, Target [mailed maternity coupons](URL to a high school student after an in-house analytics system figured out she was pregnant  before she had even told her parents  because of the data it collected from her web browsing. Some might argue thats precisely what these systems are designed to do. Jonathan Mayer, a science professor at Princeton University, told TechCrunch that BlueKai is one of the leading systems for linking data. If you have the browser send an email address and a tracking cookie at the same time, thats what you need to build that link, he said. The end goal: the more BlueKai collects, the more it can infer about you, making it easier to target you with ads that might entice you to that magic money-making click. But marketers cant just log in to BlueKai and download reams of personal information from its servers, one marketing professional told TechCrunch. The data is sanitized and masked so that marketers never see names, addresses or any other personal data. As Mayer explained: BlueKai collects personal data; it doesnt share it with marketers. ## No telling how revealing Behind the scenes, BlueKai continuously ingests and matches as much raw personal data as it can against each persons profile, constantly enriching that profile data to make sure its up to date and relevant. But it was that raw data spilling out of the exposed database. TechCrunch found records containing details of private purchases. One record detailed how a German man, whose name were withholding, used a prepaid debit card to place a 10 bet on an esports betting site on April 19. The record also contained the mans address, phone number and email address. Another record revealed how one of the largest investment holding companies in Turkey used BlueKai to track users on its website. The record detailed how one person, who lives in Istanbul, ordered $899 worth of furniture online from a homeware store. We know because the record contained all of these details, including the buyers name, email address and the direct web address for the buyers order, no login needed. We also reviewed a record detailing how one person unsubscribed from an email newsletter run by an electronics consumer, sent to his iCloud address. The record showed that the person may have been interested in a specific model of car dash-cam. We can even tell based on his user agent that his iPhone was out of date and needed a software update. &gt;The more BlueKai collects, the more it can infer about you, making it easier to target you with ads that might entice you to that magic money-making click. The data went back for months, according to Sen, who discovered the database. Some logs dated back to August 2019, he said. Fine-grained records of peoples web-browsing habits can reveal hobbies, political affiliation, income bracket, health conditions, sexual preferences, and  as evident here  gambling habits, said the EFFs Cyphers. As we live more of our lives online, this kind of data accounts for a larger and larger portion of how we spend our time. Oracle declined to say if it informed those whose data was exposed about the security lapse. The company also declined to say if it had warned U.S. or international regulators of the incident. Under California state law, companies like Oracle are required to [publicly disclose data security incidents](URL but Oracle has not to date declared the lapse. When reached, a spokesperson for Californias attorney generals office declined to say if Oracle had informed the office of the incident. Under Europes General Data Protection Regulation, companies can face fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover for flouting data protection and disclosure rules. ## Trackers, trackers everywhere BlueKai [is everywhere](URL  even when you cant see it. One [estimate](URL says BlueKai tracks over 1% of all web traffic  an unfathomable amount of daily data collection  and tracks some of the worlds biggest websites: Amazon, ESPN, Forbes, Glassdoor, Healthline, Levis, MSN.com, Rotten Tomatoes, and [The New York Times](URL Even this very article has a BlueKai tracker because our parent company, Verizon Media, is [a BlueKai partner](URL But BlueKai is not alone. Nearly every website you visit contains some form of invisible tracking code that watches you as you traverse the internet. As invasive as it is that invisible trackers are feeding your web browsing data to a gigantic database in the cloud, its that very same data that has kept the internet largely free for so long. To stay free, websites use advertising to generate revenue. The more targeted the advertising, the better the revenue is [supposed to be](URL While the majority of web users are not naive enough to think that internet tracking does not exist, few outside marketing circles understand how much data is collected and what is done with it. Take the [Equifax ](URL data breach in 2017, which brought scathing criticism from lawmakers after it collected millions of consumers data [without their explicit consent](URL Equifax, like BlueKai, relies on consumers skipping over the lengthy privacy policies that govern how websites track them. In any case, consumers have little choice but to accept the terms. Be tracked or leave the site. Thats the trade-off with a free internet. But there are dangers with collecting web-tracking data on millions of people. Whenever databases like this exist, theres always a risk the data will end up in the wrong hands and in a position to hurt someone, said Cyphers. Cyphers said the data, if in the hands of someone malicious, could contribute to identity theft, phishing or stalking. It also makes a valuable target for law enforcement and government agencies who want to piggyback on the data gathering that Oracle already does, he said. Even when the data stays where its intended, Cyphers said these vast databases enable manipulative advertising for things like political issues or exploitative services, and it allows marketers to tailor their messages to specific vulnerable populations, he said. Everyone has different things they want to keep private, and different people they want to keep them private from, said Cyphers. When companies collect raw web browsing or purchase data, thousands of little details about real peoples lives get scooped up along the way. Each one of those little details has the potential to put somebody at risk, he said. *Send tips securely over Signal and WhatsApp to +1 646-755-8849.*"

The vulnerability has already been communicated to specific international media outlets in advance.* # TL;DR Apple and Google have joined forces to provide the Exposure Notification API as a secure baseline for contact tracing app developers. In their API release (currently in beta) they accidentally destroyed Bluetooth Smart Privacy, allowing seamless device location tracking. Adding current beacon network coverage and broken IoT security to this scenario, and considering the potential acceptance rate of such a technology, this might be an Orwellian nightmare on our doorsteps. This API development needs to be brought on course with international data protection legislations (COPPA, GDPR, PRC Cybersecurity Law, etc.) or alternative solutions should be investigated. # Introduction This document describes a critical breach of Bluetooth Smart Privacy introduced by Apple and Google in their COVID-19 support infrastructure called Exposure Notification. In a collaboration Apple and Google decided to tackle the difficult problem of enabling a global scale contact tracing app infrastructure while applying cryptographic means to avoid that user privacy is affected by this new technology. Numerous initiatives have been started early on in the COVID-19 pandemic to provide local solutions for digital contact tracing via smartphone apps. Most of them raising high concerns about the user privacy impact of such a large-scale apps. Rest assured that it left me with much wonder as I reviewed the specification released by Apple and Google and quickly stumbled upon what looked like a nuclear security fallout  the API spec effectively destroys the integrity of the Bluetooth Smart Privacy functionality established in 2015 by the Bluetooth SIG \[1\]. In itself this is already a fatal situation, but the Bluetooth LE context of the Exposure Notification protocol renders this even worse. The attack is fully remote, passive and without any need for device or authentication data access. This implies that the endless number of Bluetooth LE enabled devices world-wide are potential attack vectors, resulting in a convenient tracking solution of unprecedented scale affecting every user that installs an IOS or Android contact tracing app which consumes the Exposure Notification API. The vulnerability lies in the basic protocol design and as such does not need special exploit code. Any IoT device vendor stack is prone to undesired modification to enable this device tracking. Any Bluetooth LE chip vendor is able to add such tracking under the hood. This scenario serves as a good reminder why experts should be listened to when they raise concerns about such high-impact technologies. Given the escalation of the pandemic it is understandable why time is of essence, but rushing out a solution with such a fundamental detoriation to freedom and democracy everywhere is not how things should be. Technology iterates at lightning speed, but from time to time we need to hold on for a second and think about the consequences of our actions. The question why our devices communicate with hidden peers whereever we move  without our knowledge  is a different story for a later time. # Vulnerability The described vulnerability sits in the Bluetooth LE part of the specification \[2\] published in v1.2 at the time of this writing. The encryption architecture designates a 16-bit Rolling Proximity Identifier to enable the exchange of contact data between nearby devices without exposing the user identity to the peers. The details of the encryption protocol are not relevant for this exploit, it is only the identifier rotation interval that needs to be considered. The specification proposes that the rotation should take place on average every 15 minutes, which would be the duration within which a user is trackable by a UID. After the rotation the UID is refreshed which prohibits the identification across the rotation segment. In the same specification the Bluetooth Random Private Address feature of Bluetooth LE devices version 4.2 or later is recommended to receive a rotation set randomly in between 10 and 20 minutes. Bluetooth SIG specifies this MAC address randomization feature supported by the LE Set Resolvable Private Address Timeout command to prevent devices to become trackable \[3\]. The two differing rotation intervals create the critical flaw in this protocol design. Since both MAC address and proximity identifier are part of the public Bluetooth LE broadcast packeets anyone can intercept this data simply by placing a receiver within signal range. A malicious device network could easily store and correlate both identifiers to track users moving between the device locations. Both Bluetooth Smart Privacy address randomization and Exposure Notification identifier rotation work as expected independently, but anyone holding both data points can trace devices across rotations. *Fig 1. following the user identitity by jumping between MAC address and proximity identifier during rotations* This results in Bluetooth Smart Privacy getting broken in consequence. The Exposure Notification specifies an advertising interval of 200-270 milliseconds (presumably in an opportunistic manner). Due to the random nature of the rotations a collission of the is highly unlikely, thus resulting in near-100% tracking accuracy. # Attack vectors The vulnerability exposes the user identity both on re-scans of a single device and cross-device scans. Rescanning on a device does not seem to provide much leverage because the integrity of the encryption protocol still guarantees that no undesired data is exposed. The Exposure Notification specifies a scan interval of around 5 minutes (again in opportunistic manner) for API consumer apps, so the granularity is very low for the standard use case. Now a permanently powered device like a beacon can increase scan frequency to capture much more broadcasts. But even in a high-volume scan scenario the critical impact of this vulnerability only occurs when a single malicious actor controls a network of Bluetooth LE devices with central data storage available. *Fig 2. storing both identifiers for all devices in a fleet allows geographic tracking over fleet coverage* In this case the tracking potential is only limited by the coverage of Bluetooth LE devices within a controlled network. Note that many urban and commercial areas already see full coverage of beacon networks. # IoT security context In the assessment of this vulnerability the general state of security of IoT devices should be considered. The aforementioned scenario applies to valid Bluetooth LE device network operators, which in itself should not be allowed by Bluetooth Smart Privacy. The lack of a good security baseline of IoT in general, the numerous product/device variants, and the long runtime/lack of deployment lifecycle multiplies the issue beyond undesired network operator tracking capabilities. It is a likely scenarios that advanced penetration threat actors like nation states or high profile hacking groups can gain illegit access to Bluetooth LE device fleets. Near global tracking coverage for urban areas is theoretically attainable. # Proof of concept Due to the inherent protocol behavior creating the attack vector there is no need to provide a specific PoC implementation. A simple addition of the two identifier data points to a central store would suffice. In-the-wild device fleets possibly already include these data points in timeseries databases as they are often used for network logging. In both cases the location history for a device can simply be queried by hopping between the two identifier data points whenever a rotation occurred, and following through the fleet on device jumps (because the user moved). # Possible rectification The authors have not verified the other protocol layers in too much depth, but it would seem feasible to replace the rolling proximity identifier with the random MAC address (or an encrypted derivative) for devices supporting Bluetooth Smart Privacy. Since the API is backwards compatible with very old devices it is possible that the current rolling proximity identifier approach is also required to be kept for non-privacy enabled Bluetooth devices to ensure the integrity as proposed in the specification. # References \[1\] [URL \[2\] [URL \[3\] [URL"

I've settled on three options but still have some questions and am open to opinions on the three options. You will see that I list iCloud in one of them - please see the linked post above for my opinion of the lesser evil... **Option A** Use the first tier of [mailbox.org](URL for email. Use iCloud as a replacement for Google Docs - I already pay to back up my photos currently so I have plenty of space. **Option B** Use [Mailbox.org](URL for email. Use Nextcloud as the replacement for google drive via disroot. Use Collab or local Libre Office. **Option C** Use [mailbox.org](URL for email. Use [sync.com](URL for google drive replacement. Edit all files locally via Libre Office. **Option D** Use Nextcloud for everything via disroot. OR Mailbox for everything (Can I do email via Nextcloud??) &amp;#x200B; I guess my biggest hesitation comes from using Nextcloud. Personally I don't have the time or know-how to locally host my own server with Nextcloud on it. The goal would be to be able to access the documents (and email potentially) when I am away from home and the idea of trying to provide cybersecurity for that does not appeal to me at all. But I like their UI and the various apps that they provide. I've read several threads about allowing someone else to host your Nextcloud (that's how I arrived at the disroot conclusion) but feel like I'm still fuzzy on how it would all work together. Which might be reason enough to avoid it for right now but I really want to do this once.... Nextcloud is such an attractive option to me because it looks like I could have calendars, contacts, documents, and email (???) all in one place. I could even have it on ios to backup my photos and ditch all evil all together! Maybe hosting nextcloud locally is easier than I think... &amp;#x200B; Any input (esp. on nextcloud) is greatly appreciated.

The cybersecurity expert said in particular: As authoritarianism spreads, as emergency laws proliferate, as we sacrifice our rights, we also sacrifice our capability to arrest the slide into a less liberal and less free world. Do you truly believe that when the first wave, this second wave, the 16th wave of the coronavirus is a long-forgotten memory, that these capabilities will not be kept? That these datasets will not be kept? Will those capabilities begin to be applied to small-time criminality, for political analysis, for doing things like performing a census, political polling. No matter how it is being used, what is being built is the architecture of oppression.. Snowden knows what he is talking about because it was he who, in his time risking his own life, revealed the extent of espionage at the U.S. National Security Agency, which gained unprecedented powers to monitor citizens after the horrific 9/11 attacks (September 11, 2001) as part of the so-called ""Patriotic Act,"" a federal law passed in October 2001 by the U.S. government. Edward Snowden had previously warned that increased surveillance in the coronavirus crisis could have long-term negative consequences for civil liberties. Fear of the virus spreading could cause governments to send a request for pulse or heart rate data to each fitness tracker and require access to that data. ""Five years later, when the coronavirus leaves"", - Snowden argues, ""that data will still be available to them, and they will begin collecting new ones. They already know what you're looking at online, they're already tracking your movements on the phone, now they've learned what your pulse is. What happens when they work with that information and use artificial intelligence? There is no doubt that the total surveillance and manipulation of people is desired by the authorities and will be explained by concern for the safety of citizens. Can ordinary citizens do something about it? The necessary minimum is not to succumb to the initiatives of the authorities to establish digital control. Of course, so far ""digital control measures"" look quite comical, but citizens various countries around the world have already swallowed the restriction of their freedom. Quite possibly, it was a toe in the water to look at the reaction of the citizens, who so far behave like a frog, which, without feeling the danger of being gradually heated, stayed in a pan of water until it was completely boiled. Politicians, apparently, once again learned ideas from fantasy authors: we will remember the already iconic film ""V for Vendetta"", that was inspired by the comic books of Alan Moore. To enslave the population, the government first launched a virus, and under the pretext of an epidemic, the authorities declared a total quarantine with a curfew, and violations of the regime were severely punished by the security service of Norsefire, the totalitarian ruling party. It is instructive that some of the viewers who watched the film accused the author of the script of being unrealistic and claimed that ""revolutions take place in other scenarios,"" but everything is known to be checked by time. We don't have to wait for Guy Fox yet - it's enough to get organized and get the authorities to comply with the laws before they cross that very line."

And as of today, two new zero-day vulnerabilities.",1,fts5lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/fts5lv/the_zoom_privacy_backlash_is_only_getting_started/,2020-04-03 05:55:44,"[URL The popular video conferencing application Zoom has been having a Moment during the [Covid-19 pandemic](URL But it's not all positive. As many people's professional and social lives move completely online, [Zoom use has exploded](URL But with this boom has come added scrutiny from security and privacy researchersand they keep finding more problems, including two fresh [zero day](URL vulnerabilities revealed Wednesday morning. The debate has underscored the inherent tension of balancing mainstream needs with robust security. Go too far in either direction, and valid criticism awaits. ""Zoom has never been known as the most hardcore secure and private service, and there have certainly been some critical vulnerabilities, but in many cases there aren't a lot of other options,"" says security researcher Kenn White. ""It's absolutely fair to put public pressure on Zoom to make things safer for regular users. But I wouldn't tell people 'Don't use Zoom.' It's like everyone is driving a 1989 Geo and security folks are worrying about the airflow in a Ferrari."" Zoom isn't the only video conferencing option, but displaced businesses, schools, and organizations have coalesced around it amid [widespread-shelter-in place orders](URL It's free to use, has an intuitive interface, and can accommodate group video chats for up to 100 people. There's a lot to like. By contrast, Skype's group video chat feature only supports 50 participants for free, and live streaming options like Facebook Live don't have the immediacy and interactivity of putting everyone in a digital room together. Google offers multiple video chat optionsmaybe too many, if you're looking for one simple solution. At the same time, recent findings about Zoom's security and privacy failings have been legitimately concerning. Zoom's iOS app was quietlyand the company says accidentally[sending data to Facebook](URL without notifying users, even if they had no Facebook account. The service pushed a fix late last week. Zoom also updated its privacy policy over the weekend [after a report revealed](URL that the old terms would have allowed the company to collect user information, including meeting content, and analyze it for targeted advertising or other marketing. And users have been creeped out by Zoom's attention-tracking feature, which lets the meeting host know if an attendee hasn't had the Zoom window in their screen's foreground for 30 seconds. During the pandemic, a type of online abuse known as Zoombombing, in which trolls abuse Zoom's default screen-sharing settings to take over meetingsoften with racist messages or pornographyhas also spiked. Zoom offers tools to protect against that sort of assault, specifically the option to password-protect your meeting, add a waiting room for vetting attendees, and limit screen sharing. Some paid and free speciality versions of the service, like Zoom for Education, also have different screen sharing defaults. But in general the service doesn't highlight these options in a way that would make them intuitive to enable. ""It's as though, in suddenly shifting from the office to work from home, we didn't so much move the conference room into our kitchens as into the middle of the public square,"" says Riana Pfefferkorn, associate director of surveillance and cybersecurity at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society. ""Enterprise platforms are now seeing the same abuse problems that we've long been used to seeing on Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc. Those platforms were inherently designed to let strangers contact other strangersand yet they had to tack on anti-abuse features after the fact too."" Perhaps most jarring of all, the service has a security feature that it [falsely described](URL as being ""end-to-end encrypted."" Turning on the setting does strengthen the encryption on your video calls, but does not afford them the protection of being completely encrypted at all times in transit. Achieving full end-to-end encryption in group video calling is difficult; Apple memorably spent years finding a way to implement it for FaceTime. And for a service that can support so many streams on each call, it was always unlikely that Zoom had actually achieved this protection, despite its marketing claims. Zoom did not return a request for comment from WIRED about how it is handling this deluge of security and privacy findings in its product. On Thursday, though, Zoom founder and CEO Eric Yuan wrote in an [extensive public statement](URL that the company is pausing feature development so its engineers can focus solely on security and privacy improvements. Yuan said that over the next 90 days, that Zoom will also conduct third-party security audits and penetration tests, expand its big bounty program, and prepare a transparency report on data requests the company has received from entities like governments and law enforcement. The recent blemishes are compounded by the fact that even before the pandemic, Zoom had a reputation for prioritizing ease of use over security and privacy. Notably, a researcher [revealed flaws](URL last summer about how Zoom seamlessly joined users into call links and shared their camera feeds without an initial check to let users confirm they wanted to launch the app. That means attackers could have crafted Zoom links that instantly gave them access to a user's video feedand everything going on around themwith one click. The research also built on [previous](URL Zoom vulnerability findings. Zoom's gaffes have also started to invite even more potentially consequential scrutiny. The company is [facing](URL a class action lawsuit over the data its iOS app sent to Facebook. And the office of New York attorney general Letitia James [sent a letter](URL to the company on Monday about its mounting punch list. ""While Zoom has remediated specific reported security vulnerabilities, we would like to understand whether Zoom has undertaken a broader review of its security practices,"" the attorney general's office wrote. Given this track record and all the commotion about Zoom security in the past few weeks, macOS security researcher Patrick Wardle says he recently got interested in poking at the Mac desktop Zoom app. Today he is [disclosing two new security flaws](URL he found during that brief analysis. ""Zoom, while great from a usability point of view, clearly hasnt been designed with security in mind,"" Wardle says. ""I saw some researchers [tweeting](URL about strange Zoom behavior and literally within 10 seconds of looking at it myself I was just like, aw, man. Granted I research this stuff, so I know what to look for. But Zoom has just had so many missteps, and thats very indicative of a product that has not been adequately audited from a security point of view."" Wardle's findings pose limited risk to users in practice, because they would first require the presence of malware on a target device. One attack focuses on a Zoom installation flow that still relies on a now-retired application programming interface from Apple. The company deprecated the API because of security concerns, but Wardle says that he sometimes still sees products using it as a lazy workaround. An attacker who has infected a victim device with malware, but hasn't yet achieved full access, could exploit Zoom's insecure install settings to gain root privileges. The other vulnerability Wardle found is also significant, though still only a local access bug. macOS offers a feature called ""hardened runtime"" that lets the operating system act as a sort of bouncer while programs are running and prevent code injections or other manipulations that are typically malicious. Developers can choose to add exemptions for third-party plugins if they want to have that additional functionality from an external source, but Wardle notes that such exceptions are typically a last resort, because they undermine the whole premise of ""hardened runtime."" Yet Zoom's macOS application has such an exemption for third-party libraries, meaning malware running on a victim's system could inject code into Zoom that's trusted and essentially link the two applicationsallowing the malware to piggyback on Zoom's legitimate microphone and video access and start listening in on a victim or watching through their webcam whenever the malware wants. Wardle [confirmed](URL that Zoom had fixed both flaws by Wednesday night. Though it doesn't look like researchers will stop finding flaws in Zoom any time soon, the most important takeaway for regular users is simply to think carefully about their security and privacy needs for each call they make. Zoom's security is likely sufficient for most people's general communications, but there are more protected group video chat optionslike those offered by WhatsApp, FaceTime, and [particularly Signal](URL could be a better fit for sensitive gatherings. ""The reality is that companies are going to have mistakes in their software,"" says Jonathan Leitschuh, a security researcher who found the webcam hijacking flaws in Zoom last summer. ""The more criticism of a platform, the more secure its hopefully going to be. So hopefully Zoom is taking the information that theyre gaining and actually acting on it. But if you *need* to be secure and secret, I would not recommend you have those conversations over Zoom. Use a platfor"

For the last several years I have slowly learned more about how the internet works, encryption, cybersecurity, company profit models, etc. I mostly just kept following this rabbit hole out of curiosity because I'm a nerd. After learning everything I have (which many on this subreddit are surely aware), I felt compelled to leave Google behind and do as much as possible to own my own data. I switched to a (paid) e-mail service that provides the ability for encrypted e-mail. I use a (paid) VPN most of the time. I use DuckDuckGo for web searches. I use the Brave browser. I try to use Signal for messaging. I use a password manager. I use HTTPS. I use 2FA when I feel it's warranted. Lastly, I began hosting my own cloud service, which even allows collaborative document editing (which I find a necessity). It's all working and I believe all of this is quite good for the goal of owning and controlling my data. Thank you to ""the internet"" for helping me get to this point. However, it takes time to manage this (mostly hosting my cloud). And others don't like the slight inconvenience I might ask of them, like a password on an e-mail or requesting to use Signal (or at least WhatsApp, although that metadata is very valuable to Facebook). As always with increased security and privacy, it comes at the expense of convenience. It would just be so much more *convenient* for me to just give up and *embed my whole life* into the Google (or Apple) atmosphere (Google even sent me a free Nest mini--how *nice*). It all just works so damn well together and would save me so much time. It's bad enough to have our personal data (which, in whole, is astoundingly revealing if you are not aware) shared/sold without or knowledge, but I actually worry more about the potential damage that we are not even aware of yet and the inevitability that some or all of this data will end up in the wrong hands with no chance to get it back. Also, with quantum computers, even if our data is sitting encrypted on a server it might not be safe in a decade (yeah I realize this is far off, but I'm a forward thinker). It'd be nice if there was a paid version of Google that took privacy seriously, but I don't see anything nearly as all-inclusive. I even found the Librem phone, which seems neat, but I don't know how far down this rabbit hole to go. In your opinions, **is it worth it to take a stand and avoid this ecosystem**? If so, for which aspects? Is there any all-inclusive solution in the works to try to compete with Google/Apple for those of us willing to pay? Or should I take the easy route and say ""screw it--I'll go back to Google--at least we'll all go down together""?"

BCM has a technology team composed of geeks and hackers who pursue excellence and value innovation, aiming to influence and change the world. Based on cybersecurity attack and defense, AI and blockchain technologies, we designed and developed a new generation communication platform with high-security level. Each communication message sent and received using BCM Messenger platform is based on end-to-end encryption, and no third party can decrypt the content of the message. We will consistently be devoted to privacy protection and communication interconnectionand strive to build a reliable and safe Internet of Everything. #### Q: Is BCM free to download/use? Yes BCM is free to download and free to use. BCM team is a group of developers who strive to make communication safer and the world a better place. Our goal is to create a disruptive blockchain product that's completely free to use which is different from most products based on blockchain technology worldwide these days. #### Q: How to register my BCM account? You can download the BCM App from the BCM official website bcm-im.com, App Store, or Google Play. After the download is completed, click the BCM icon, select ""Create Account"", click ""Stop"" to get your account key- the key is your unique certificate in BCM. #### Q: How to add friends in BCM? In the main interface, click the contact icon located at the bottom to enter the contact interface. You can scan the QR code to add a friend. #### Q: How is BCM different from Telegram? Technically, BCM is similar to Telegram in some aspects: both of them use 256-bit AES symmetric encryption algorithm for content encryption, and the encryption level is extremely high. The differences between BCM and Telegram are: 1) Every message in BCM private chat and group chat is end-to-end encrypted, the forwarding node cannot get access to its content 2) Telegram's encryption of group chat and default private chat both happen on the App &amp; both ends of the server which means the server can get access to the decrypted content. End-to-end encryption is used for private-chat only after the ""Secret Chat"" mode is turned on. #### Q: How is BCM different from WhatsApp? From technical perspectives, the private chat of BCM and WhatsApp are both based on Signal Protocol, and the security of the encryption algorithms of both Apps are the same. However, while group chat of both BCM and WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted and support Perfect Forward Security (PFS), the number of people in WhatsApp's group chat can't exceed 256/per group when every group of BCM can support up to 100,000 people. In addition, WhatsApp does not open source, but BCM will gradually open source. # About group #### Q: How do I start a group in BCM? Simply enter the chat interface, click the icon located at the upper right corner to open the new chat interface, click on ""New Group Chat"". You can select the group chat member directly from your contact list, or you can add people directly by entering their phone numbers. # Security of account #### Q: How to back up my account in BCM? For your privacy, please perform a cold backup on another device. You can click the ""..."" icon on the BCM main interface and select ""Account Security"" to open the account backup page. The page will display the QR code of your account. You need to install BCM on another mobile phone. Find the """" option like explained above to back up. BCM will provide more backup methods for our users in the near future. #### Q: How does BCM encrypt data? How safe is BCM? BCM's encryption method is one of the most secure encryption methods known in the world. The private (one-to-one) chat process uses the X3DH based on the elliptic curve-Curve25519 for key exchange, and implements the Double Ratchet process to ensure that the encryption key of each chat message is different. The chat contents are encrypted by AES-256 symmetric encryption algorithm. The encryption method guarantees: 1) Encryption is end-to-end. Third-party nodes such as forwarding nodes do not intervene in content encryption and decryption, and have no ability to decrypt any content. 2) Conform to perfect forward security (PFS) features. 3) In extremely special cases when the user's private key is exposed, the third party still cannot intercept nor decrypt any chat content. For group chats with up to 100,000 users/per group, BCM also uses AES-256 symmetric encryption algorithm for end-to-end encryption, and ensures that the encryption key of every unit of chat content is not repeated-meeting the requirements of perfect forward security(PFS). #### Q: Does BCM have a privacy policy? You can view our detailed Privacy Policy when registering for a BCM account. #### Q: Do chat messages in BCM go through the server? BCM chat messages pass through the forwarding node (either a user PC node on the P2P network or an officially deployed server). Because the contents are end-to-end encrypted, the forwarding node is only responsible for forwarding the data message and cannot decrypt the forwarded chat content. # Deeper questions #### Q: Will BCM open source? BCM is planning to open source, and we will gradually disclose source code of BCM to the public. #### Q: Can BCM replace Telegram? / What will happen to the future of BCM? When every disruptive product has just emerged, it is not necessarily the most recognized product in the market. However, as more and more users feel the revolutionary changes brought about by BCM and free communication, the more BCM will grow. Imagine the future where everything is interconnected, and when everyone has their own BCM IM account. Through BCM, people can not only communicate safely and conveniently, but also easily communicate and connect with everything. BCM will become the real ""smart assistant"" in the era of ""interconnected everything"", and truly make ""connect everything with one account"" reality. BCM, with its characteristics of decentralization, tamper-proof and multi-party consensus mechanism, will become the infrastructure for activating and connecting everything: not only in the field of communication, but also in the process of linking people and all things. #### Q: What is BCM's short-term goal/ long- term goal? In the short term, what BCM wants to achieve can be building a ""blockchain WeChat"", a cryptocurrency exchange, a mining platform, a small program, a digital currency financing platform, or a blockchain e-commerce platform, etc. In the long term, what BCM wants to accomplish is to use blockchain technology to change the traditional transmission path of information, people and things. BCM aims to fundamentally solve the information-transmission's path security &amp; trust problems."

Is that even such a thing? 3. **Access online resources.** We use a well regarded and (supposedly) logless VPN, but pay via personal credit/debit card. Is this a security concern? Are there additional holes that a VPN does not address? 4. **Distribute online resources.** This is just text and links. An HTML document could be ideal.

163,cybersecurity,privacy,7 Ways you can Protect your Clients data,2,bhkf6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/bhkf6k/7_ways_you_can_protect_your_clients_data/,2019-04-26 19:38:47,"When a client conducts business with your company, they entrust their personal information and credentials to you for safekeeping. The Data Protection Laws in Australia assert that businesses must make use of every possible tool at their disposal to ensure that the privacy of their customers is guaranteed. The escalating cases of wide scale ransomware attacks worldwide have only served to highlight the importance of finding different ways to keep your customers data in safe hands. Australian businesses were crippled by the recent outbreaks of the [Petya ransomware](URL attack, affecting legal firms, courier companies and other large businesses. The sheer size of a company didnt really matter to the virus and it affected everyone equally. However, it is true that smaller businesses have been hit the hardest. According to a 2017 Data Breach Investigation report by Verizon, [61% of data](URL breach victims are small to mid-sized businesses with less than 1000 employees. Although the tools that cyber criminals use to steal away confidential data are evolving, their best means of breaking through a systems security is by tapping into their victims lack of awareness. The most common means of compromising data is by using phishing attacks. It doesnt matter in the least to these cybercriminals whether the data belongs to patients inside a healthcare facility or sensitive accounts of financial institutions such banks; the end goal is to use this data as their meal ticket. # Here are a 7 ways of protecting your customers data: **1. Triple DES** It was meant to originally replace the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm and was hailed as an industry standard for being one of the [best symmetric algorithms](URL Triple DES makes use of three individual keys, each of which is 56 bits. It is gradually being replaced with other algorithms since 3DES does also seem to suffer from the same weaknesses that the original DES was plagued with. For instance if the first two or last two independent 64 bit keys are equal, the advantages of 3DES are negated. TDES was primarily designed to encrypt hardware, which means that it is especially slow to use in software. **2. AES** AES is fast in both hardware and software, using 128 bit, 192 bit and 256 bit keys. This means that a hacker would require 2256 combinations to break through with brute force. AES has become the preferred means of encrypting data so much so that even military, government and financial organizations make use of it to protect their data sent over the internet. Cracking AES encryption is  theoretically speaking  next to impossible because of the massive scale of combinations required; something which is only confined within the realms of fiction. Perhaps the evolving technology behind [quantum computing](URL might come close to breaking it. &amp;#x200B; **3. Blowfish** Using symmetric encryption that was meant to replace the DES algorithm, it is one of the fastest block ciphers which makes it perfect for use in smaller devices such as mobile phones and laptops. It is primarily used to send secure data packets over the internet. It has 64 bit block size with key lengths varying from 32 bits to a whopping 448 bits comprising of two keys, an expansion part and a data encryption part. Blowfish does have some known weaknesses with their keys, the discovery of which can lead to your data getting compromised. &amp;#x200B; **4. Encrypting the entire hard drive** It makes sense to protect your customers data by encrypting every bit and byte on your hard disk doesnt it? Thats what encrypting the entire hard drive accomplishes. Each time you want to access your hard drive, you will need to enter a password which is safely stored with you. This is especially useful if a thief manages to get access to your drive by stealing your desktop or laptop. They would not be able to access any data because of all encryption. It would require thousands of supercomputers working in tandem for over a thousand years to be able to force their way in  by then everyone will have either died or just have lost interest. &amp;#x200B; **5. File encryption** If you dont want to bother with protecting the entire hard drive, you can encrypt parts of it which contain sensitive information pertaining to your customers. There are various software that can encrypt your data such as [7-zip](URL which is free and more comprehensive paid solutions such as Folder Lock. &amp;#x200B; **6. Application based encryption** The application gets the key from the user and uses it to encrypt the data which is then written over the database. It can also retrieve encrypted data, decrypt it using the provided key and perform processing over it. The application itself can be reverse engineered, so it is imperative to avoid writing the keys within the application. &amp;#x200B; **7.** [**Training your employees**](URL Workers that arent very tech savvy are more prone to click on affected email and download malwares which can then make its way into the system. Even the best security systems will fail to protect you if your own employees are unaware of the harmful effects of downloading anything from the internet which says ***Click to download*** on a big red button with an arrow on it. So train them on the best practices for cybersecurity."

Yesterday, I decided to write to my professor about my concerns regarding the requirement of a LinkedIn account to complete an assignment. A summary of the email went something like this: &gt;Im a privacy conscious person, Im not comfortable creating an account with LinkedIn, by creating an account with LinkedIn I would be obligated to agree to their ToS, and can we discuss an alternate assignment? Today I received two separate responses. The first email arrived early in morning, the second one arrived late evening. A summary of the first email goes something like this: &gt;Creating an anonymous profile would defeat the purpose of connecting with like-minded security professional in your field. Try connecting with Alumni Services and write a report about career growth and development. So, the good news is, I have an alternate assignment now, which was my original goal.

I never had a chance to reply back to this email, but then the second email arrived in the evening and read: &gt;Hi Student, &gt;I talked with Dr. Chair, the Chair of the ____ program about your concern. He recommended an alternative written assignment that I would like you to do instead of the one that I suggested earlier today. &gt;Here is the assignment (I have also attached a copy). Many cybersecurity professionals use LinkedIn. Either these people are uninformed, careless or understand the risk and know what to share and what not to share. Considering these possibilities, address the following: &gt;1. How does the focus and function of LinkedIn differ from Facebook? &gt;2. What kinds of information in a LinkedIn profile might be dangerous? - What school, colleges, and universities have you attended? - When did you graduate from these educational institutions? - Your major? - Your areas of interest? &gt;3. In what ways could this information be harmful? &gt;4. For those that use LinkedIn, what are the best practices with respect to information that should &gt;and should not be included in their profile? &gt;5. What are best practices with respect to accepting a LinkedIn connection? &gt;6. Lastly, how does a student go about finding a job, if he/she is not using LinkedIn and/or recruiters? &gt;Thanks, &gt;Professor ___ This new, alternate assignment is obviously a play on my opposition towards LinkedIn. To this email, I was excited to begin writing since there are so many ways to approach these questions. I suppose the reason I am writing this is because I would like to pick your brain on what elements or areas you would focus on. One redditor made a good point to include a LinkedIn data breach that took place a few years ago. If anyone else has good insight on concepts to touch or areas to mention, even if its not related to this assignment, that would be great. Im all ears. Thanks"

To do this, they have designed a reliable environment that validates and processes the operations, the *marketplace* is 100% compatible with all Ethereum network. With recent (and not so recent) scandals about data breaches and growing concerns, initiatives as Wibson become necessary. In the project mentioned today, **the importance of privacy is highlighted at first sight** ; what caught our attention was the principle of sovereignty. To **decide which data are sold and wich data not, is capital** . Users, should be able to have the ability to analyze and decide whether to trade with their private data or not; and thus enjoy the profit they generate. The **titanic social networks that dominate the sector**, in agregation with a market of apps for mobile and tablets, **have traded and exploited all data openly** . **The Blockchain or Crypto sector is investing great efforts to raise awareness among users** . Wibson is ideal for those who venture into the sector and want to be encouraged by their valuable data. Veterans have established a sense of meaning and sovereignty which houses the privacy online. But ... Is it easy to get it ? Do we have the training for it? Wibson puts it in the palm of your hand, and this has led us to publish the article. In NoticiasBitcoin, we have [published on privacy above](URL , raising awareness about it . &amp;#x200B; ##### Wibson approach commitment to sovereignty over private user data To start in the correct scenario, initially it should be noted a general ignorance.

Giving to the user the power removed when ""Allow"" is pressed, it is the first step. Without sacrificing personal privacy, it is achieved with Wibson users to sell private information securely validated. For this, **the robust ethereum network has been chosen** , so **the decentralized data marketplace Wibson works in the second blockchain more adopted** at ""*cripto space*"". **The program designed by Wibson for users will provide financial incentives**, thus rewarding participants for such sales. For more details about the token Wibson (WIB), **please visit the official website**. Or stay pending updates at their Telegram channel. In the bottom of the article we share Wibson official social networks. &amp;#x200B; **Data collection violation reported a few days ago is another notice to internet surfers** A few days ago, while Christmass closes the last hours... A big security report the network. A large collection of ready filling credentials (combinations of email addresses and hacked passwords used to be discovered hijack accounts on other services).

Surely they can't build a backdoor into absolutely all software out there. The next best thing would be to create a list of software they would deem 'troublesome'. If they did this they could track users software super easily. And now that MSFT owns Github I wouldn't be surprised if spying is streamlined for the Five Eyes w/ open source 'troublesome' software. Whether they do that or not is beside the point though; if someone is somehow caught with a 'troublesome' program, how can we ensure they're not unfairly discriminated against? In law it's often required to have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt for something. If Google consented to one of those radius warrants that hands over info of everyone in an area, and someone has Orbot or an undocumented open source program on their device, they may be given a WAY harder time than an average person.

My main objection to that is very simple:If I have 10 different complex passwords that protect 10 different sites, how does it make any sense to put them under only 1 password, reducing the number of passwords to crack from 10 to 1? In fact, that would be the same that using the same password for all those other services, I would be creating an adittional potential fault point that would, also, compromise the rest of my keys. This is specially true for managers that require an internet conection and are not open source: as far as I know, they could very well exfiltrate the passwords out of my device.

I have a password manager and 2-factor authentication enabled for everything that supports it. My device isn't rooted. Hell, I use burner phone numbers whenever possible as well. Could this be considered ""enough""? My threat model is simply: I don't want to be tracked, monitored, or have my data collected. I want to avoid this wherever possible but without sacrificing too much convenience. I've been considering the possibility of using a custom ROM for a while - but then there are questions of ""Well, are any more secure or private than stock Android 9?""

I would say rather that I am a self-conscious individual who tries to live his life as best as he can without fucking up too often. For 4 years Ive been in the US as a refugee. For someone who came from the outside, I occasionally disagree with norms and truths which others take as granted. Like eating habits, or the fact that I do care about the environment, poverty, education system, and corruption on high political levels, unlike many of my peers. Im not going to sign up with a rebellion camp, but I try to be open-minded and really see what's going on around. On top of that, Im a writer. It is my passion, I love doing it and want to make for a living while doing it. However, it also makes me concerned. Im not exactly scared of anyone digging up some criminal secrets about me and sending to jail, but after being for so long on my own, I started to realize how vulnerable I am. For too long I didnt invest enough time into my own cybersecurity. &amp;#x200B; I installed Tor browser and decided to go from there. I looked back at how I store my information, my passwords, my identity online - it made me unhappy. My main concern is, of course, the fact that big corporations know about me more than I do. Im tired of being targeted with special offers, with receiving 100500 emails how did you enjoy your visit to Starbucks/bank/grocery shop, and I am not happy about my phone giving all the private information about my life away. This nation already suffers from overconsumption and I don't want to fall for it too. Its not my first time giving up an old lifestyle and taking on a new one. Those who are more experienced about their online security, could you land me an advice and give a few tips so that I start the right way and save myself a big deal of time. Trial and error is a great way to do things.. but slow :) &amp;#x200B; First of all, I dont trust google. For a little while Ive replaced it with DuckDuckGo. But I still have a Gmail account which I used for too long and, perhaps, carelessly. Any advice on how can I quit using the old email? Honestly, I wanted to delete it and start all over again, without signing up with 3 million websites which I dont even remember. But I believe that stop using it is not enough, is there anything else I should? Like wiping out my old footprints to some degree? I want to restart my digital life, but what do I do about all those facebook/instagram-like websites which, I'm sure, tracked me for so long? I've barely used them and uninstalled apps from my phone but at this point, they could collect a lot of information which I'm not aware of. &amp;#x200B; Obviously, what kind email box can I use instead? I know that I shouldnt open random and creepy-looking emails, but from what Ive read about google - it seems that it is too easy to retrieve my personal emails from the Gmail and some of it might have been sold and resold. On top of that, I cant know if I have any unwanted malware on my devices. Simply wiping out them all and reinstalling the OS - is that enough? With that said, I also wondered if there is a website like Reddit, but which only can be accessed with Tor? What Im looking for is some other reliable alternative, without ads and articles from big magazines. As I said, Im a refugee and there is this not much I can do to save the world. However, I want to be informed and protected. &amp;#x200B; Without being too paranoid, what are simple steps for me to take in order to start over and increase my awareness of how the information about me can be used without my permission?"

Machine learning is one option, as it can help todays modern solutions learn how to be more effective against advanced threats. On the other hand, whats stopping the other side from also taking advantage of artificial intelligence? The answer: nothing, nothing at all. If you think about it, this makes a lot of sense, as computers are capable of working much faster than humans. Plus, they are less prone to user error. Hackers have found A.I. to be effective for the deployment of phishing attacks. According to a study conducted by ZeroFOX in 2016, an A.I. called SNAP\_R was capable of administering spear-phishing tweets at a rate of about 6.75 per minute, tricking 275 out of 800 users into thinking they were legitimate messages. In comparison, a staff writer at Forbes could only churn out about 1.075 tweets a minute, and they only fooled 49 out of 129 users. A more recent development by IBM is using machine learning to create programs capable of breaking through some of the best security measures out there. Of course, this also means that well eventually have to deal with malware powered by artificial intelligence, assuming that it isnt already being leveraged somewhere. IBMs project, DeepLocker, showcased how video conferencing software can be hacked. The process involved the software being activated by the targets face being detected in a photograph. The IBM team, including lead researcher Marc Ph. Stoecklin, has this to say about these kinds of attacks: This may have happened already, and we will see it two or three years from now. Other researchers have demonstrated that A.I. can be used in cyberattacks, even going as far as using open-source tools to make them happen. What do you think about this development?

In the interview, Ms. Payton acknowledges the myriad privacy and security issues associated with facial recognition. But then she offers a disappointing solution: &gt;Payton isnt calling for an end to biometric scanning and facial recognition. Instead, she proposed a more responsible way to use it hand-in-hand with other technology. Rather than rely solely on something like a fingerprint scanner, Paytons advice was for companies to combine it with behavioral-based data that could act as biometric two-factor authentication. A system might be able to know things like when the individual typically makes transactions, what kind of operating system they use, or how fast they type. There is lots of other interesting info in the article that points out why we wouldn't want to be uniquely identified. like examples of Facebook patents for ""augmented commerce.""

The hackers known as Fancy Bear, who also intruded in the U.S. election, went after at least 87 people working on militarized drones, missiles, rockets, stealth fighter jets, cloud-computing platforms or other sensitive activities, the AP found.

I am taking a class called ""information Systems"" where we learn how to properly prepare material and prepare to create a system (basically it is charts/models class). Our professor gave us our final a few weeks ago instructing us to find a business and to ""interview"" them about a mock system that we would prepare for them based off of what they tell us they need (basically be an unpaid consultant). Although i understand the value in the ""real world"" experience, he wants us to get each persons contact info, the address of business, any information about their business we get from out interviews, and contact info from each ""potential stakeholder."" As someone who is supposed to be learning about how to protect information and an aspiring cybersecurity professional i feel so wrong doing something like this. The person i interviewed has expressed that they wish to remain anonymous and every person i talk to about this project thinks it's creepy and weird. I don't know my professor, in fact it's an online class so i have only seen him a handful of times and now i am expected to hand over the PII someone as well as the details of their job and the jobs of others? When i asked if i could keep everyone anonymous he basically said that i waited to long to have this problem and no one else had an issue (also a bit disturbing). I just got done writing a lengthy email to my dept chair to fight this, although i have never had to do anything like this before so i have no idea what step two is. I am continuing my final without giving away this information however i could potentially fail and have to take this class over again with the same professor. This was mostly a rant, but i am also looking for any advice. no idea if this is the right subreddit for this, so if it isn't I'm sorry."

Retrace your steps of how you came to understand a certain program or way of thinking. We have to take on the role of teachers, privacy isn't a blue or red issue but many are justifiably scared of a Trump presidency. I worried about privacy whether it was going to be Clinton or Trump, but that doesn't negate the fact that this is going to be a bad time for privacy and surveillance.

Seeing the massive anti-Trump protests across the nation gave me the idea to print literature that would appeal strongly to protestors, especially since many are young and new to the political scene. I think a flyer with one page full of useful protesting rights and tips, and the other side about protecting yourself with encryption, tor, secure email, taking off your fingerprint passcode at protests, etc., would engage the people attending these protests. By taking advantage of this time and political climate where people are now legitimately afraid of an authoritarian Trump presidency we can impact hundreds, maybe thousands of people with the turnout these events are having. What's great about this is you don't have to agree with any of these causes to participate, the purpose is to educate people on how to keep themselves secure and maintain their privacy. While the anti-Trump protests are dying down, they will spike again around inauguration and there are still similar rallies being held (like the Unity Rally coming up in Los Angeles). This gives us time to organize and put together flyers or leaflets for distribution. I can make something like a Slack page and that we can all keep in touch on and then split up by regions/counties. I'm from the Los Angeles area and coming up we have [Bernie's Unity March Los Angeles](URL on Sunday Dec. 4, [#NoDAPL March Los Angeles](URL on Saturday Dec. 10, and [#UnitedAgainstHate Anti-Trump Inauguration March Los Angeles](URL on Friday Jan. 20. Is anybody interested? PM me or comment below, I'll organize it. Even if we're from different parts of the nation we can use the use the resources we all pool together and recruit our friends and peers from our areas to collectively achieve the same effect. A bunch of people passing out the same flyer spread out throughout the rallies will reach more people and ripple to their friends and circles inspiring many, and we can speed up the adoption of privacy tools, encryption, and cybersecurity."

I know that there are several programs for iOS and Android that can be set up to control and monitor the devices. I've heard of mSpy and their security issues. Today, I wanted to ask about a program called TeenSafe, obviously meant for parents who want to ""keep an eye on"" their children. It is legal, available for both platforms, and supposedly captures GPS location, app usage, messaging, etc. After watching their installation videos, it appears that several security measures must be circumvented to set it up, especially on the iphone. On iOS, it looks like a certificate must be installed to allow the device to be managed. All this leads me to believe that there are inherent security risks to using these services, not to mention questionable ethics.

Along with the security demos, animations, news clips, and other footage, I am trying to get interviews from a variety of sources: Cybersecurity experts, black hat / grey hat hackers, victims of hacking / phishing / social media theft, experienced Deep Web users, and also informed Internet users with something to say on any of the subjects. You can be anonymous if you'd like to (It's almost encouraged, as I will be remaining anonymous in the film too), and I can offer up some services that could be pretty beneficial depending on your situation. For example, if you were a victim of a hacking, phishing, etc. attempt, then I'd do some investigation on how you made yourself vulnerable, who could have targeted you, and how to prevent it in the future. If you're a grey hat hacker, I could share with you some of the working exploits and scripts I've written myself. Or I could just buy you a nice dinner during or after the interview! Please let me know on here through PMs. Or email me, at the.web.the.film@gmail.com. I live in NYC, so if you were anywhere around, that'd be great so I can get live footage. Otherwise, a Skype interview or even a phone call would be good! Thanks for reading.

Sixty-two of the flaws were classified as medium risk. &gt;According to the report, the CMS agreed with all of the IG recommendations and began fixing the problems before the audit was complete. &gt;CMS reported that it remediated all vulnerabilities and addressed all findings we identified before we issued our final report, the report states. We have since reviewed the supporting documentation and verified CMSs remediation. &gt;The exchange site has been under fire from regulators since its disastrous rollout in 2013. &gt;A 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) said that health officials failed to implement best practices across the entire system, leaving small weaknesses that place sensitive information at risk. &gt;The GAO is expected to release another report at some stage this year about what it described as multiple cybersecurity incidents for HealthCare.gov. The system was apparently breached by hackers last summer, though according to reports, no consumer information was viewed or taken. &gt;We presently have work ongoing, looking at both the security and privacy of the state-based insurance marketplaces as well as looking at the incidents that have identified for HealthCare.gov by [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services], Gregory Wilshusen, director of information security issues, told members at a House Oversight Committee hearing in April. &gt;Approximately 10 million consumers currently rely on HealthCare.gov to buy health insurance coverage."
