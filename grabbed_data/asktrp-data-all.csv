People judge you social competence within 20 secs of meeting you. Never show ANY vulnerability, people subconsciously take this as weakness, despite the bullshit society tells us. Be arrogant when you are losing, admitting to your faults/what you should work on when confronted makes you look weak, unless you make it seem insincere. If people are still hanging out with you after they have seen weakness/weak frame, they are just really patronizing you because it makes them feel better about themselves, they dont actually respect you. Society is hypocritical, people say things that sound good so they dont seem callous or ill minded (Just Be yourself!)"

According to trp, if a woman picks up on a vulnerability, then shes probably going to indirectly exploit it and would have no need to act. So is this a sign that Im getting better at demonstrating an impeccable frame to the women around me? Or am I just delusional/completely wrong and the reason why shes asking is because she does see a vulnerability?"

Ive been on my grind and worked out, hung out with friends and put all my energy into work, but lately Ive been ill due to my pancreas and so Ive been a bit emotional and needy. This girl is needy too so I stooped down to her level in a moment of vulnerability. She asks me to hang out a few times this week and I went to see her, and I even asked to see her last night.

It's hard to explain the feeling but it's like an extreme state of catharsis from vulnerability (emotional nakedness), acceptance of one's existence as a human being, and in a sense a form of validation that ""everyone's like this in their own way and you're normal"". I'm aware that this should be self-achieved, but even with self-work, I've never been able to achieve this state to that level. I've found that most chicks (and just human beings in general) don't want to hear all the truth, and want selective truth that sounds nice. I don't think I'll ever be able to achieve this again, outside of selective vulnerability. I've been doing affirmations in the morning and finding other ways to simulate that without giving up my frame but I'm not sure if that state is ever achievable again. Is there any hope to achieve this? Is this what therapists are basically for? Do I need to always be sort of finessing on the down low with everyone, and then just coping with a therapist, online anonymous interactions, and then maybe VR?"

Is this reasonable, or is there some issue on my end in terms of my perspective? Like some sort of fear of vulnerability or leadership, or desire to keep the control mentally and avoid conflict? Because this bleeds into everything. Here are some examples: (1) I can't donate to the homeless in person. Once I humanize them and interact with them, I start to actually care about them deeply to a self-harming emotional state, and them being in that vulnerable state and me being in that power position makes me intensely uncomfortable and ruins my day. (2) When a girl really likes me or when a girl is naive or needy, I feel uncomfortable continuing the relationship or accepting advances because having that sense of control makes me feel like some sort of wolf in a sheep's den. That's the best way to explain it. I know that I'm a good person in terms of my actions, but I also feel like I'm being selfish by having that awareness or power over the person. Like maybe I don't trust my shadow self? I don't know. (3) I love children, and can accept what raising a child entails to a degree, but the concept of having complete control over another individual's choice to exist brings me a sense of dread. I could bear raising them, while ensuring as much individual freedom for them as possible, but how could I justify birthing them without being a hypocrite or self-centered in enacting my personal wishes or morality?"

She got a tinder match while we were fucking (Mad? Nah; maybe a 3some buddy If you let me reply to the messages), but told me later shes also talking with girls. I dont want to let my feelz get in the way of the potential glory here. My current goal is to continue to let her do the work, take advantage of her presence when she makes it convenient, FOCUS ON MYSELF, CHANNEL MY ANGER-PHASE INTO MORE LIFTING... So after seeing myself write all this, I guess the idea here besides the above should be: how can I get her comfortable sharing her sexcapades with me without getting butthurt. Example: If she actually follows through with a potential 3some buddy, it would be harder for me to accept it emotionally If she selected a dude. Im open to MMF (never done it) but (obviously?) would prefer to start with/make routine the FFM situation. Can some veterans comment on downgrading an LTR to a successful plate who continues to open up and share sexual vulnerability? Is comfortable talking about her orbiters..

Sharing that makes you look open and honest and the other person doesn't view you as less since that vulnerability doesn't affect them or pull them down. This is in contrast to crying about something that you're currently dealing with and having to burden others with it. This is a huge turn off to not just girls, but guys too. Unless they also have their own issues or are people pleasers. Do you have any examples of flaws, or mistakes, or past vulnerabilities that can be admitted to in order to make someone feel like ""damn they even admitted to that?

Sometimes some would mention my insecurities and it does get to me. Yeah bitch test or not but I've always had self esteem issues even though objectively I was blessed with incredible genetics. Women often manage to make me doubt my own value while my emotions are involved. Then after the relationship I can't believe I put up with that shit and kept her around. It keeps happening. They get you hooked and then fuck with your mind. Usually it starts off with them worshipping me and thinking I am way above them and I do act accordingly but later the dynamic changes and they think they're better I guess. Not all women are like that. I suspect I am overly confident and that triggers them to try to fuck with me when they find a vulnerability. How would you deal with that?

It's implied here that even in a solid LTR of years, showing emotion or vulnerability even for 1 day means the doom of the LTR as she will never respect you again. That kind of thinking seems so absolutist. &amp;#x200B; The concepts of RP seem to be more true the more the woman is ingrained into pop-culture. In other words, the more her identity is based in pop-culture, the more predictable her behavior in which case RP really shines. However, in my city I've never encountered quite the level a lot of field reports and anecdotes people talk about here regularly.

I really though ""she's different"" since I was her first and she was mine, no social media whoring, good family etc. We broke up eventually because I couldn't be in a relationship like that. &amp;#x200B; Here's the catch, she's now with another guy from my city, surprisingly just 2 months after the so called break up and posting it on the internet. How did this happen ? Super simple: we went to Uni in another big city, I rented a flat for myself and she decided to stay in campus since she couldn't afford anything else(and RP advises to not live with your bitches). I remember that she said one time that she went with her roommates to some boys room one night for playing some games. I didn't thought much of it because she was still behaving. Add a little bit of no comfort on my part because I was focusing on exams and the female nature comes to life. She's now with one of those dudes. The funny thing is that he's not even better looking or better career ( I am in IT, he's physical education or some shit). He was someone new and fresh and was there with her every day while I was the dude who gave her the chills in the past but slipped here and there with comfort tests and maybe too much vulnerability. &amp;#x200B; So boys , don't be like me!

She had a literal BDSM room which she funded for herself. She never insulted or tried to throw me off guard, and she'd call me out if I was negging too harshly.

Ive met this super cute girl who told me beforehand she isnt looking for something serious but just wants a fwb. We met in a bar, talked a long time and drink some beer. It was a great convo, it made me relax a bit. Then we drove to her place and my nightmare begun. We drink 2 glasses of wine and suddenly start making out and the fun begins. Well. Atleast I hoped so. All the evening long I was thinking about the upcoming sex and how to perform and what will happen and all this shit because I know myself that if I start to overthink or something my dick stays soft. The funny thing is, when making out, and all foreplay long Im SUPER hard and horny. But as soon as we get naked and we need to get a condom on, its often over. My dick is soft. Or its semi hard and I try to bang her in a position for some seconds and my head is spinning so many thoughts if Im doing it right and shit and its soft again. And even if she blows me rly good or we relax and I kiss her or finger her or even lick her pussy, most of the time I dont get back hard. So this Time I started to panic as I could see how disappointed and bored she got. And i felt super shitty, like a complete loser. The fullest bluepilled shit came out of me as I was thinking about vulnerability and that trying to hide my insecurities and performance anxiety would make it worse because I was thinking: if I act like its not a big deal, she will ghost me afterwards because she will think I dont find her attractive or I cant fuck properly so instead I opened up and tried to express my thoughts. We talked a long time about why this happened and that I feel like shes disappointed and shit. She tried to tell me its okay and all but I felt like she is just lying to me. Well at the end I luckily got hard again and came within 5 minutes, but its getting worse. Also she started to text me a lot less, so its obvious she lost all attraction for me. And this is hard to swallow, because its happens every time with a cute girl that I try to plate. Yesterday met another girl at her place, it got all super wild and she tried to please me in all different forms, blow me rly good and shit. But even after 4 hours I could not get hard again. God, this is killing me. I cant stop thinking about it. How can I have a ONS or build plates when I cant fuck them? Already lost some plates because of my dick that is not working the way I want it. And i know its all pure psychological, BECAUSE Im a horny bastard, Im horny all day all night, get morning woods, random hard boners all day and yet when Im with a woman I cant stay hard. BUT in the foreplay Im super hard! But the foreplay often takes too long so I start to get soft, also putting a condom on and all those immersion breakers destroy my errection. What should I do? I never tried viagra. Today I ordered a pack of 25mg generic viagra (hope this dosage is enough, cuz I thought 50 would be too much). do you have any tips? It doesnt matter if I drink some alcohol or not, but in my experience drinking a bit alcohol to relax, helps more than being nervous without it. Im starting to freak out. Yes, i was my whole life extremely porn addicted and fapped a lot. Im on nofap right now, and been avoiding porn since 2 months. Also trieing to masturbate only once per month at most. Until now it didnt helped shit, but guess it takes way more months until my brain rewires. TLDR: failed to stay hard with 3 girls already, even tho in the foreplay Im super hard, but as soon as it turns into sex and have to take condom on, i get soft and cant get hard for hours after. I have huge performance anxiety and my head does not stop thinking about it. Tried alcohol to relax and without, no changes. Im going for Nofap now since 2 months, because I was my whole life extremely porn addicted. Plates lose interest after this incident. What can help me?"
37,vulnerability,asktrp,Being open vs never opening up,1,f5gjam,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/f5gjam/being_open_vs_never_opening_up/,2020-02-18 08:59:30,"I've picked up Models by Mark Manson. Found it to be quite an interesting read which in many ways enhanced things I've already known after reading TRP for some years. However, I found some inconsistencies between the book and other basic sidebar material. In the book the concept of vulnerability is explained. Mark mentions that for those who do not live their 'true' self, those who are looking for validation from others, including women, it is vitally important to open up and accept yourself, to show vulnerability and move on from the past. He mentions that it doesn't happen overnight and one needs to open up bit by bit before his individuality is fully exposed. This allows a man to accept himself which in turn improves relationships with other people as they see you as a real vulnerable yet learning person and not a fake. As someone who lived (and in many ways still lives) a life of seeking validation from others, this resonated. I get what he's saying. However, in those years with RP I've learned from both reading and personal experience that opening up, especially to women, can backfire massively. This happened with my LTR from a few years ago, I opened up about my past failures with women and this changed everything. Since then, I've been very careful with not exposing such things. I've also seen quite a few comments here suggesting to never open up to a woman. I can't put this together at the moment. I feel that was he's saying is that one must risk losing a relationship with a woman, or many women, until his true self is exposed and he accepts himself. Does the end result depend on HOW a man exposes himself, as in 'I've had hurtful previous experiences but it made me stronger' against 'I've had hurtful previous experiences so please be gentle with me'? Of course, in the former case a man allegedly gains respect while with latter he asks for pity and thus loses respect. Or, is not opening up reserved for those who have already accepted themselves fully?"

Throughout my life, i've dated many girls and have also talked to many of them: usually 99% of them said that they prefer to deal with a guy who is more masculine, dangerous/brutal...That's who they get attracted to, when it comes to sex. So, i really don't see how does vulnerability adjust to those criterias. How can you be lets say if not brutal and masculine, but an alpha and be vulnerable? Doesn't this mean that you need to keep on approaching girls until you find the one that likes you? How about the seduction? How about a chick that is being a bitch to you right away, but you end up banging her at the end of the night? What do you think about it?"

I had finally separated from my babys mom of 13 years. Two months in I was going strong alpha, but unchecked and ignorant to how to act and make the correct decisions. I worked in a brand new dispensary, in a state where MJ has just become legal. I am a tall good looking guy. Many girls wanted to fuck me but I was awkward because I didnt have much experience and I grew up on historical feminism and never had a dad as he left when I was a baby. I was very respectful to girls and while alpha outside I was beta inside. The most beautiful girl who came in to the dispensary kept coming in and flirting with me. She basically took me out and fucked me immediately. I thought it was awesome and that I was the man. She was cheating on her husband with me because she said he didnt care. She was mad because he let one of his friends fuck her while he watched and participated. True cuckold. She became obsessed with me as my SMV increased every day as more and more women began showing interest in me. The biggest mistake I made was getting her a job with me. Then it all went to hell. Her SMV increased because she went from being a lonely stay at home mom to now having friends and being invited places and having an awesome life that she needed me for until I bought her into my world. Long story short over the course of time I became more beta, specifically displaying symptoms of neuroticism and being reactionary. I alienated people in our circle who were important to us and kind of separated myself from everyone except her. They ended up taking her away from me and she allowed it to happen. I became an AFC as she slowly separated herself from me. I gave her everything she wanted and then she didnt need me so she cut me out of the equation. I pushed her away. She was so into me though. All she did was talk about me and how much she loved me and she didnt care who knew she wanted everyone to know for a really long time. She tried so hard to stay with me even through my beta transformation. I lost my job and then it really went down hill. She purposely put nails in the coffin. She fucked a guy that works there. She had orgies. She started drinking and doing drugs. She lied to me and said bad things about me to make me look like a fool. She led me on for a couple months too. She just couldnt take it any more and needed to be done and it was the only way she knew how because I kept breaking up with her and coming back and she took me back and over and over and she just snapped. I dont blame her. I should have trusted her but I didnt trust myself. It really was legit the real deal. She did everything she could to be with me. I just pushed too far with bad decisions and becoming a pussy. I embarrassed her. She also has a very fast spinning rationalization hamster. I had to find out from someone else. I feel like she is now tarnished, used up trash, used goods but it kills me because of what we had. It could have been a scarcity mindset on my part. It also could be I am fabricating what I wish was there. But there were times I even thought about that while it was happening to make sure it wasnt that and it wasnt. She truly desires me. It was in her eyes. She had a vulnerability that screamed help me tommy. That she needed me to be an alpha for her and she would have loved me and only me forever. We were the perfect fit. She was 29 I was 34 we were the perfect height, perfect looks for each other, I have 3 kids she had 2 and we loved each others kids. But all the while we also had serious problems with our spouses we were trying to separate from. I became more and more beta and tried to rely on her for strength but I should have been her strength. I took the best thing I ever had and became weak and lost it. I feel like she is just lashing out now because some of what she did she did specifically to hurt me. She wouldnt have done it otherwise these were specific incidents. She needed me. I ended up needing her and that is where I failed. I lost my alpha and she needed an alpha and I dont blame her. Its her instinctual desire. But now I see she is the definition of hypergamy but she doesnt know that. If she would learn about redpill and read Rollo Tomassi Rational Male I feel like it would make her look at her life and her choices differently. And she would then be able to better control her instincts and be with me. Let me play my role as kind and hers as queen. But I think it is all gone. I think she may have died inside and there is no coming back. I can get all the pussy in the world. Its not worth it to me to spin plates. But that is what she is doing. I believe that she would not have left me for a bigger better deal. She loved me and I believe as long as we had necessities and a bit more she would have been with me forever. Everything I have learned from researching the shit out of red pill and the rational male and stoicism I see that she was a scared little girl who needed me to be her daddy. I say that in the right way. Not a father. But her daddy. I understand it now. And now that I see where I failed and pushed her away I know how to correct it but I feel it is too late. I want her and only her. Oneitis? Other girls dont do it for me. I just dont care about them. I want her back. But she may be gone. What we had was not a fabrication. It was a real thing and I destroyed it. I could have been so much better if I understood how to be a man. Now that I do I feel like it is a day late and a short bus. It is killing me inside. I want her back but I will never be able to see past what she did. Ill never be able to trust her again. So I have to move on but I could be Chad and fuck 1000 smoking hot college girls and it wont fill a void. She really was it for me and I was it for her. We were perfect with each other and it wasnt bullshit. I know the principals in the manosphere say what we had was stereotypical and a lot of it was but I see clearly some intangibles were not. I just dont know what to do. She didnt have to go as low as she did but it was my fault for losing her. She would have stayed with me forever. I just became a bitch and she needed to be done with me and I dont blame her. I lost the best thing I ever had and it was not a lie. It was not bullshit. I had something with her. And I fucked it up and Im just destroyed. Im really struggling to move on. What should I do try to get her back or move on to meaningless fucks. Thanks in advance."

I felt great and this gave me huge ego and self esteem boosts, but after 1-2 dates I didnt event feel the need to see them again because I wasnt feeling any chemistry something was missing. So I acted busy, hard to get, douche, dumped/friendzoned some even. I got 2 plates and dating life was great. I loved to be a Fuckboy/asshole. Then I had a talk with my mother about women. She brainwashed my mind heavily, told me I must not treat women like shit because it all will return to me 3 times and all that bluepill shit. Im a religious guy, like I really believe in god, and she told me god will never forgive what Im doing with these girls and in return I wont ever find the love of my life if I keep doing this because if I treat women like shit and break their hearts, the same will happen to me. So... I dumped all my plates, friendzoned all girls I played games on and told to myself to be honest with women. Btw all those girls I met through dating apps. Now the hard rejection phase starts. I met a cute girl through tinder, we had great chemistry and when we met, I thought wow, we have so much in common Blabla bp thoughts and my hopes for a ltr came up. I made a move and we made out, cuddled a lot but no f close. Next date is at her place (and thinking about this makes me sick of how stupid I was) to watch a movie. I did not even try to escalate because she told me she wants a ltr and so I behaved and acted like a boyfriend. She also did not Give me the impression that she wants more, she felt really passive. Well anyway. Next few days she suddenly texted less, lost interest, flaked and I recognized I lost her. I blocked her and got all depressed, couldnt understand why. Today I do. But it still hurts somehow when girls tell you they want something serious, they want to take it slow , they feel the connection and then they flake and lose interest the next day. Holy shit. Only with trp I am starting to understand this, but its still hard to get it in my brain, because Ive been all my life hard bp and in my youth even a niceguy. The next months I got rejected so often its insane. All my luck was gone. I got so many numbers from apps, all girls which seemed high interested and almost all of them flaked and always seemed busy for a meetup. And it fucking killed my ego and my self esteem. Im back to the ground again. Recently even though I discovered trp, I still have not successfully swallowed it and am still more of a purple pill even though I dont want to. But its a hard and slowly process. So recently I met an amazing girl through bumble. We met and made out, had nice talk and she was looking for a ltr. My hopes went up again and I played my cards again like boyfriend material. Second date she told me about her sick grandpa and I opened up so much and talked about emotions and shit and how much i understand and bla and tried to follow the advise of vulnerability from Mark. This date was no kiss and in the evening we sent each other a big text. Next thing is I ask her when shes free and she acts suddenly all busy and I told her to hit me up when shes free. Its been 2 weeks and she unmatched and deleted me. Yeah... oh. And I finally got a new plate which is only a 4/10 smv, we met twice and fucked each time, but I often got ED and had a bad time trying to stay hard when using a condom. Today i asked her to meetup and she also suddenly tells me shes super busy and has no time in the next weeks. Guys. I know this is a lot of bullshit cry from my side. I just feel lost. Since I am reading everything about trp and trying to manifest nothing succeeds with girls. Maybe I suddenly act like I have 2 personalities? Or girls smell that i try to act alpha but deep inside am totally weak? Also I lost some weight during this phase, stopped working out, and am only 140lbs while being 64. I am skinny and have low self esteem, depression every now and then because of this and overall feel like im living in a nightmare since I cant trust any women anymore, realized all girls are sluts somehow and the dream of finding the love of my life like I searched all life is all fake and not existing. And all this Information fucks with my head. I wish I had a mentor who would guide me and who i could talk to. But all people I know are hard bluepilled and I dont know how to become the rep pill. I crave it, i want to be a man of high value, an alpha, and want to Manifest a DGAF attitude but I cant. I get hurt so easily, I care for everything what people say or think and have several anxiety. I dont have many friends, more like none nearby and after school sit in my room trying to hide from society. Then I read and read everything about trp and think hell yeah lets go. And as soon as I step out of the door, I get scared, nervous, anxious, crave for female and male attention, look after every girl I see and get flooded by needy thoughts 24/7. God. Writing this makes me even disgusted by myself. Yesterday I started to concentrate to gain more calories, to gain weight (even tho Im a hard gainer and been super skinny my whole life), deleted all numbers from girls I was secretly waiting to reach out, deleted all apps except tinder (also want to but somehow cant) and am thinking about going monk mode until summer. I have hurt my left hand, so I cant work also cant go lift, so Im stucked ... but as soon as my hand is healed I will go to the gym again and lift like a mofo. This all has to come out. I know I sound weak and pussy, but I am just seeking for some help. Somehow I feel like the people here are the only ones who truly understand me even though some people are harsh. But its necessary I guess. I dont know how to continue in life, Im 25, still in school, and feel like i am completely lost in this life and am stucked since years in the same position without success in any aspect of life. I dont want to be this loser anymore. I want to become the best a man can become..."

Don't get me wrong, I'm on a right path in life, thanks to you guys, red pill and own progress in the past three years I've changed my life around, found motivation and energy to work hard towards my goals. I don't sit around either, I stay busy at work, I've been regularly going to the gym for the past 7 years. I am not ugly. Sometimes, especially when I go home for holidays, I have to block girls from messaging me. I cook, read, keep everything clean and tidy, work on being more positive towards my coworkers, learning to be an example for others. In fact, I've noticed that lately, I started becoming significantly overqualified in everything but beauty for the girls I'm seeing, who are usually not older than 23 (I'm 28). I just do everything a hundred times better than them. When I have a girl around I feel even more motivated, like if there is a muse, I feel complete. But alone? I feel loneliness sinking in, I become erratic, overthinking and swiping on Tinder like a maniac only to find the next girl to be the same old, same old. I have game, I almost always either k- or s-close on the first date. I seem to always choose one girl, catch oneitis, expose my vulnerability and move on when I feel it's over. Rinse and repeat. I believe it stems from my childhood - my mom never really loved me. It seems that I'm looking for this love in every girl that I'm seeing, and despite reading a hundred times that women love men conditionally, I am still looking for that love from them. I am a melancholic romantic and it doesn't seem to be changing. How can I be happy alone?"
42,vulnerability,asktrp,"How's Mark Mansons Models ""Vulnerability"" in par with trp?",1,eim59q,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/eim59q/hows_mark_mansons_models_vulnerability_in_par/,2020-01-02 06:04:02,"So I'm curious in trying to understand the things Mark is writing in his book. When he's talking about vulnerability he explicitly said its very important to start getting vulnerable. He said its not beta to tell the girl you're dating or about to fuck what you feel, what anxiety you got and all the things to open up to a girl. I get this and it makes sense, but on the other side, how is this not a beta trait when im meeting a girl and start telling her im nervous, i cant get hard because of less sexual experience or whatever? People in this sub tell you must never open up to a girl, not even in a LTR. You have to always keep your fears, your weekness to yourself. But Mark guides to a different path. So where's the fine line? Should you really skip this advice even though it makes sense and as he said its an important step to become Non-Needy. And if so, maybe I got it wrong. How do I have to internalize this step counseled by Mark? He explained it like, if you try to manipulate a girl or EXPECT to get laid when you open up, then you're doing it wrong. But when you just let your emotions flow, like in his example when he went over to this girl who wanted to fuck and he couldnt get hard, he told her he's nervous, havent had sex for a long time and first wants to ""get to know her"". At first she looked at him like she lost interest and creeped out, but then they talked and get to know each other and had great sex. Im trying to understand this, as im trying to swallow the pill. But I just don't get it. People here tell the opposite and also I dont know how to apply vulnerability in my dating life. Whats your thoughts on this?"
43,vulnerability,asktrp,"Curiosity and ego burden - Is there a way to admit guilt in LTR, without giving up at all to your frame?",3,d2z2b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/d2z2b9/curiosity_and_ego_burden_is_there_a_way_to_admit/,2019-09-12 09:31:21,"Sorry for the long post, but the below is an internal conflict which I have from game, TRP and life experience and I'm just looking for an opinion, cause, at this point in my life, I'm still very excited about TRP, I started learning a lot, but I tend to have a very big ego and I'm also, somehow, tired of games. It's stuff I don't quite get, although I want to. Disclaimer. The following has a 'rant' character. It's very big, it's pure madness, didn't edit any of them, are my thoughts, which represent a very big inner conflict I recently developed on The Red Pill. If passionate about meta, please leave your input below. I'm looking for, encourage and appreciate it in advance. But beware. It is a lot of (abstract) thinking. Thanks! I'm not drunk high, or even tired. I didn't take some time, but I had some time off recently and, based on some personal situations and what I know, it hit me. . . So.. In a relationship. You do mistakes. You recover. Then you do some more similar mistakes in time. You're an idiot. And you know it. But not cause she implies it. Cause you feel it right after the moment you were mistaken. But you don't want to apologize. You know she also did wrong to you (some disrespect), but you started shit. You know she has to apologize first, but she tends to do this when she's feeling you're alpha again i.e. safe. When she's not submissive to you and wants or expects something from you... Is there a way to bypass all those games, without giving up to your wants, not even 1 percent? Can you resolve what you did wrong with your girl, without apologizing, attracting bigger similar shit tests, repeating the situation or involving too much no contact and SMV raise, for frame loss? And without winning the lottery or other similar sudden soap opera transformations? I looked into soft next, but I'm looking for something like authenticity, assume your failures, without changing the dynamic or giving the power away. More like giving the power without giving the power. Is it possible? I did some soft next in the past, but it's like after she chased me like crazy, for me to leave her and chase her again (contact her, not chasing like crazy), feels odd. And I'm either desperate (showed up announced at her place, from where I gamed) or in doubts and she can feel both from me, of course. And once a chick approached you, gamed you and you let her, then, with some input here and there, you had her in your palms, after doing some wrongs cause you're stupid sometimes, for me, to contact her without being chased feels like giving up to something and setting a rhythm which I don't like. Assuming it works, which can, if value still present or raised back, sure. I read this post today about auto-rejection. It's the state girls tend to enter, when they actually are hurt by you. And this comes from expectations. Which come from you setting the frame from the start and not keeping it or, if you change it, you do it in a tiranic manner (no finesse, calibration). Shit happens. URL But it's game stuff. TRP is more direct, in like go do you, invest yourself in you, do other chicks, detach etc. But what if you want to do this and also not wait for things to calm down or for you to recover? Isn't TRP a mindset and a strategy? What if I want inside TRP to behave in a way that is congruent to it, while still recovering almost instantly? When you take time after frame loss, it's like you don't allow yourself mistakes. Judging yourself. But the, again, you have to analyze yourself as well. Where is the fine line? It's like.. I have this mindset I want to implement. I do good and I do bad. I do mistakes our of reaction (not my intent, not assuming them and doing them on purpose). Then, OUT OF REACTION TO MY STUPIDITY, I HAVE TO take time, recover, forget, invest elsewhere and in me. Isn't this still an action at the mercy of the context created by myself, put of reaction to a different context? Why do you have to go even lower (reaction to reaction) than before, just to recover? Can't you recover at that point you made the mistake? Like on the spot? Without apology or giving up to something, except to the mistake itself? Isn't TRP actually making us needy in terms of holding frame? Like adversarial mode? It kind of made me see women, WHEN I FAIL SOME TESTS, in adversarial mode, not collaborative. Like if I fail, YOU HAVE TO HOLD FRAME. So it's needy, even though directed towards my own beliefs. But the girl senses she somehow affected you, cause you HAVE TO hold frame, thus you NEED TO hold frame. But if I apologize, it's weakness. And leaves room for more. To see what more she can get away with, in the future. But if you don't apologise and don't hold frame, you don't care. And you're not aware. A thing I recently did was, when it happened to lose frame, to let her know it's as intended. Or even blame her for the lack of trust (cause it's intended) and reframe-ing as me testing her. But one thing I k know from women is, if it's something you do and it looks like you know what you're doing, they are buying it. Even beating them (to an extent, of course). How come? If you take time away after frame loss, doesn't this show like you don't know what you did and you reflect? And, if you do you meanwhile and come back as nothing happened, doesn't this mean a lack of awareness? How can a powerful man hunt without being aware? If you don't treat the subject, unless she opens it, after soft next, then you treat it as a shit test or comfort test, doesn't this mean like you submit your lead to her, for a moment? Isn't a true leader aware and comforting? Even though a true leader is not DEERing, isn't he anticipating and diffusing a situation before it rises? Isn't taking time after frame loss actually admitting guilt, therefore weakness? Like I need to recover? I'm not talking here about her testing you by acting bad, without you losing the frame, and you don't reward it with attention. I'm talking about the need to recover from frame loss. Why the need? What is to recover. From vulnerability? Isn't suppressing vulnerability in front of women in a proactive manner, makes it come out at some point in a reactive manner? Isn't making us humans? Not the weaknesses, but the awareness and the work we put on them, for new heights. Isn't TRP.. Anti-antifragile (for connaisseurs)? Am I looking for the Holy Grail of TRP? Like, if emergency, use this. Isn't this reacting? A lot of guys, including myself, talk about dread. Like she says this or does this, do dread. Do you. But this is reaction. And the place it's coming from has her on a somehow pedestal. Can't you do a constant dread, by actually being authentic with her and feeling and living the bad emotions of rejection, disrespect or failure with your SO? Doesn't this make you at a very deep level take the best decision, based on what you truly want? Why all the mental? Why all the strategy? If you truly want something, don't you develop your own strategy, inspired from others who had success? If you have a big ego and want something from a place of ego... Isn't more helpful to expose yourself in situations where that ego is challenged and see if you still want it after your ego is crashed and there is no chance of achieving it? Yes, I'm still talking about LTR. Cause I was that guy. To want something very bad, with big ego, but the desire is not authentic and it transformed into need. The need to serve the ego, that wants to either grow, either not get hurt again. And in LTRs, this was highlighted in very subtle but brutal manners and I didn't get it. Cause, somehow, I feel TRP is promoting a big ego idea. Ego is good, but keeps you in place or helps you recover, if you want to go up. So I think the biggest question out of all my madness is... What if abundance mentality IS NOT healthy? Or... How can you have abundance, without getting into your own way? How can you become more powerful, how can you be without having to do? Are men valued by what they do (as per TRP) or are men actually valued by what they are AND THEY EXPRESS? By their courage TO BE THEMSELVES and act on their inner power towards outside? Is what you do valued or is what you are as a man, as well as a woman, but, cause you're masculine, your courage is a self expression in a more... Abrasive manner? Isn't the starting point of TRP a reaction? Isn't the starting point of it putting men, from the beginning, lower than women (you have to work to get there, same level)? What if the pro-action is the expression of inner masculine, like re-action is the expression of inner feminine? What if, when you do mistakes and resort to dread, you are feminine (re-action)? But what if you apologize or admit and this is submissive, as a re-action to what you did out of fear or arrogance (ego)? Isn't David Deida talking about your dark side and you have to embrace it? How can you accept her dark side, if you haven't accepted yours? How can you fear something you accepted? How can you te-act to something you don't fear? All this rambling rant leaves me to this final (and finally lol) question: ISN'T TRP A COPPING MINDSET AND STRATEGY, DISGUISED AS A THRIVING ONE? (worst of worst) Thoughts? Help? Thanks again. . . Tl,dr Inner conflict on TRP. Possible debate (if interest popping, if not, at least cleared my mind). Deep level misunderstandings. Meta frame and values alteration. Inner fuel and some loss of trust. Madness for most, possible reframe of TRP for the rest. Too bad reddit TRP is under quarantine now."
44,vulnerability,asktrp,I don't think TRP is the absolute truth (vulnerability related),1,d314n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/d314n1/i_dont_think_trp_is_the_absolute_truth/,2019-09-12 12:12:06,"I just gave a comment to someone on another thread and I felt to write it as a post here, as well. I had an inner conflict on some TRP ideas and how things may work in some context, related to vulnerability. Which is a tricky subject within the manosphere and mostly here. If you feel to challenge the below words, question anything (even me) or contribute to them with additional insight, it will be much appreciated. I don't know what exactly happened, but something hit me these days. OK, I had some situations with some failed shit tests, some stuff in my personal life and new things I learned, but these thoughts came almost out of nowhere, in the middle of the dark. Beware, long post. . . . I don't think TRP is the absolute truth. I do think it can be, if it's part of the absolute truth. As an expression of the absolute truth. I think it's a new way to see what has to be seen. Which was already there. I don't think TRP is new. It's only uncovering of something that is old. And was already there. TRP is a tool. A powerful one. But it's like having a knife. You have to be willing, in case of emergency or any other situation, to adapt without the knife, as well. Hence, the exception of the rule. And, if there are exceptions, it doesn't stand for absolute truth. The power and responsibility of vulnerability and authenticity is what I'm currently discovering and it's an inner conflict I have from TRP and game. TRP was born out of need. But as a reaction to something that, perhaps, isn't even there. Like feminism and sexual revolution. It is there, yes, but as an expression to something else, not as an absolute truth! A truth, in some way, cause it's true by expression. But it's a masculine expression of a feminine reaction to a weakness in masculine. If that makes sense. So TRP is a reaction to an over reaction. Isn't this a prerequisite for shit test failing? What I want to say is... Accept TRP and accept feminism. To use them wisely to your advantage. As tools. One as a tool for a powerful mindset and life, other as a millennial lesson for improper masculinity. And, to accept it, you have to respect it. I hated feminism. Now I don't know if I should love it, cause it brought me to RP. Love is more powerful than hate. Love gives understanding. And motivates. Hate gives denial. And scares. Why the hate phase? Feminism had to happen. TRP had to happen. So.. You hide your weaknesses. But. You should love them and be proud of them, cause they push you to your strengths. Accept them. If your wewakenesses are revealed, assume it's as intended. That's why they shit test. To see if you have control over your weaknesses. If you refuse them and react by force dread and frame reset, this is another reaction. And, when she tests, she has to do it to check if you already knew about those weaknesses and this was only your masculine expression out of sheer situational awareness or you did it cause she did it first, to test you. The first tempers further tests, the latter ensures for more, even on the same category, in the future. Until you learn your lesson. That you should be working on your weaknesses anytime and not be afraid to uncover them, if pressured. BUT! At your own pace and volition. And only to gain more, not to preserve. To gain is masculine, to preserve is feminine. And since TRP tries to preserve some values, it lacks adaptability. If those values were there before, yes But.. Only the personal truth and the absolute truth get to truly preserve their values. Also, since TRP appeared as a reaction to another reaction, it cannot be the absolute truth. So.. There are cases where TRP may be wrong. Edge cases, of course. And vulnerability and HOW TO PROACTIVELY use it from your own intent is one of them. ""Never show weakness"" only works so far for me. Cause, if totally true, how come, in pickup, you have massive success when you exaggerate your flaws? How come this determines confidence? Everybody knows that pickup is relationship dynamic concentrated and fast paced, in order to skip weeks of dating and get the lay. I say use weakness and show it PROACTIVELY. Anything can be used. This is true power. Adaptability and options. If you don't show your weakness voluntarily and as a man (from above, when you want and it's not needed), your woman will dig them from you. She wants to see you. Fully. She also wants your power. But to experience it, not to have it all and having to move to another. She wants to be with a powerful man and stay like this. She is more comfort oriented than you. That's why the power play. It's cause she saw your power and you didn't want to give it to her a little and now she wants it to see why is it so valuable. And I mentioned fully. This means weaknesses as well. Holding frame as a reaction to something is not holding frame. Is holding a reaction. Is being afraid. She wants your power? Test her, make her qualify, give her the power, then take it back. Be willing to survive without a tool. When needed. And be willing to show this to her. When you want it and when she needs it. Not when she wants it and you think you need it to show it. Alpha without flaws is fake. And she knows it. That's why, when it would have been smooth sailing, it won't be. Because of this. Smooth sailing won't be anytime. But it can be more often than you think. I do believe this. That's why telling her you miss her (rarely, of course) out of your own volition and after her investment is not weakness. Although some redpillers say the contrary. It's like she feels she deserves to see you fully. TRP appeared out of fear. To make it a powerful tool, I believe we have to accept it also has flaws. Or can have. Although very limited, of course. It seems unnatural only when it promotes the male strength without vulnerability. It's basically a tool promoting another tool. But this is not antifragile. Cause antifragile is focused on growth. Vulnerabilities make you powerful, within the proper context. You can pass a shit test by displaying vulnerability and you can fail a shit test by not displaying vulnerability. It's in how you do it and why, more than in what. It has more weight. Of course, there are guidelines. But recommended ones. Doesn't mean I can choose to be vulnerable. If it's from a position of strength, to gain something, can work. And will work. If it's to preserve something, it may not. PS: In Antifragile, Nassim Taleb gives an example of several restaurants. Some of them are beating the hell out of the rest and some of them disappear. Restaurants by itself are fragile. But the whole restaurants system is fragile, due to competition. And it grows. Same with vulnerability. And shit tests are only verification tools by applying pressure. To remove the shit or to see if you gave your shit together. And, if you react by not displaying weakness, you will have to display it at some point. But why all the tactics? RSD talks about prevention oriented and promotion oriented. And this lesson I took it hard the last days. I'm just saying that, even if you use TRP proactively, to gain a better lifestyle, for it to work you have to accept it may have flaws, in specific contexts, and one of them is this: the power of vulnerability, as far as I see it here. I do believe you can use it. Sure with caution. Thanks."

In addition, **the vast majority of other men aren't worth befriending.** However, I'm wondering if any of ya'll have dogs or any other pets.

She drove me to my car at the end and when i asked her if well see each other again she said ""Why do you ask that all the time?"" (I asked at the first Date too - mistake i know now). She will think about it. Then asked me jokingly if i want a hug so i can have a good sleep. Answered yes, went in for the kiss and made out a bit again. &amp;#x200B; When driving home she texted me she a deer jumped infront of her car and she killed it accidently. Asked her if her car and even more she is ok. Got a text the next morning ""I hope it was dead on an instant"" to wich i didnt replied so far. Havent texted since then. When would be a good time to ask her out again and how should i even phrase it?"

52,vulnerability,asktrp,How to become emotionally healthy?,1,c2v8lj,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/c2v8lj/how_to_become_emotionally_healthy/,2019-06-20 22:10:22,"I read an amazing comment in another post, written by u/itswr1tten , which really opened my eyes. He said that most people look for validation, which is true also in my case, making people behave disfunctionally. Men seeing that women seek validation, start to behave as detached, which gets you pussy, but in the long run is not healthy for a man, that gets addicted on women pursuing. This way you can't form stable, healthy relationships, not only with other people, but also with yourself. I'm looking for a routine or online resources, to better my emotional health. Because I think that this is really the source of not only my problems, but for many. The PC can't work correctly if the software is badly designed. Here is the comment: &gt; Just read this and quit your validation drug addiction by liking yourself first. It's typically a sign of low self-esteem. Often it's not a relationship we think we're looking for but really validation. And that need for validation is something that we feel neurotic about receiving when we lacked appropriate validation as a child. If a father was emotionally distant, then the daughter tends to form a model of love that resembles that. Love to her looks and feels like the anxiety of the fear of abandonment and need. When we lack a true relationship with ourselves then it becomes very difficult to have a true relationship with others. When we cannot love ourselves then its difficult to accept the possibility of love from others. Validation is an attractive alternative because it doesn't require vulnerability. And we tend to avoid vulnerability when we lack the maturity and wisdom to be able to process pain and trauma, which is typically a sign that we've repressed a lot of trauma and have this subconscious fear of re-experiencing it again. As an adult, validation is more like a drug we use to distract ourselves away from our own underlying state. It's why emotionally unavailable people can be so attractive. It's not the person you're attracted to per se, but the drug of validation. In this case, relationships just appear in the form of symbiotic arrangements where one or both parties narcotize each other. There's no connection, it's just people using each other as drugs. And then modern culture tends to portray this as love in popular media, and that can cause even more confusion where we think that this is romantic. In reality, emotionally healthy and mature people find emotional availability to be attractive, and emotional unavailability to be unattractive. The anxiety that comes from seeing an unavailable person is a warning sign. When we're not emotionally healthy because we have internalized a corrupted concept of love, we interpret that warning sign as love rather than as danger. But when we're healthy, we know that we should stay away from that person. A person who is unavailable typically means they have issues they need to deal with and aren't fit for a relationship right now. But with the way that society is going, with consumerism constantly providing distractions for people to avoid inner confrontations, everyone seems to be carrying issues with them for prolonged periods of time. If you find someone that is genuinely secure and available because they are abundant, that is a confident person. And being around them can raise your personality attachment style, assuming its of the insecure variety such as avoidant or preoccupied, to a secure attachment style. Overall, being around healthy people can improve your mental health and confidence too. Receiving secure and consistent affection can change how we see ourselves in a positive way."

Which I brushed off but took note of it. At first I thought she meant dont come back. As in you again, your at it again or stop coming. But then to my surprise she was really friendly and open. A strange change from last week. I pushed the vulnerability and asked for selfie seizing the moment. I wanted to test her open friendliness. She quickly accepted it. Though it was strange to ask fir it as its not the setting or why would I want one? I gave no explaination and was sort of aggressive on the selfie. She didnt protest. I had to come back for a second one because I came out wrong in the first and she was friendly again. Both pictures came out good but I dont take that stuff seriously. The reason I am stuck on the again comment is that she made a reference to our past communication and women never openly indicate they remember you. But she did point out it was on her mind. I didnt know if to take it as interest. That with her new found warmth attitude throw me for a tail spin. It wouldve been better if she had acted as cold as she did in the past and I wouldve just accepted she wasnt into it and moved on."

Got a very practical lesson recently. A girl was very into me, she even seemed very emotially supportive and empathetic, but I didn't think she was a good match for a number of reasons. So I showed vulnerability to her, thinking this would either bring her closer to the soulmate state or drive her away. Perhaps my own weird shit test for her. And of course the latter happened, the panties dried up immediately. Now, my question is what motivates you to still keep going in the dating game, knowing and accepting the red pill? Is it only sex? I mean, I like sex but it's a whole lot easier, faster and cheaper to masturbate. If I have to constantly pretend to be someone I'm not and put on a super alpha show for them, just so that I could occasionally deposit a load, that seems like a horrible deal.

Both have their benefits but in attempts to improve my social relationships (both sexual and non sexual), Ive tried to be more transparent and open in situations when I sense a truly genuine connection with someone. Im guessing one should have a selective vulnerability to people like close friends and family and will having an air of ambiguity and mystery to strangers? Sometimes its hard for me not to give full disclosure and be constantly aware of what Im revealing as Ive purposely tried not to overthink when conversing with people (an issue from my more introverted past) Any thoughts?

However, is being too loving/vulnerable without being over invested a bad thing? For example, i value my own time and goals, but when I'm with her I'm making the moves, organizing surprise dates, trying to provide pleasure and love, and willing to be vulnerable/make risky propositions and be honest about my emotions, putting my feelings on the line. For example, when we started dating I commited a red pill sin. She said she wanted to break things off, because she didnt like casual hookups. I first expressed i understood where she was coming from and that she was free to do whatever she wanted. Then, after a few minutes of talking about her qualms, I told her i had feelings for her and proposed we date so that it wouldnt be casual. She was surprised at first but thought about it for a bit, 20 minutes later we were dating. According to red pill, the guy should never be the one to propose commitment. But isnt that what old fashioned men, who led their relationships and who swept women off their feet did all the time? Couldnt this vulnerability be seen as confidence, and this willingness to be a leader be attractive? Or would this turn her off and lower my value in her eyes? "

I also lost 45 pounds coming off rexulti and effexor xr but now also lift much less in the gym unless it's just winter and my career circumstances. When I had these emotions blunted before on effexor xr and rexulti, I didnt care as much about anything but it was beneficial for attracting women and working out like a machine every morning. however, currently getting my MBA on scholarship money I live off of and dont have a job lined up until next spring as a scout for a professional sports team, so sitting home at the moment without a current job takes its toll more now than it did. The sports job next spring has been something I wanted for years and im trying to occupy my time until then but cant get a job in the mean time for whatever reason past 6 weeks. Was I just attracting hot sluts when I blunted my emotions and didnt care? according to my friends that was the case until I came off effexor xr and rexulti which were the 2 antidepressants i was on and now I'm on wellbutrin xl for post-ssri sexual side effects, adderall xr 25 mg for adhd and low dose anti-anxiety alprazolam for withdrawals and severe anxiety. After being off the two antidepressants the past 5 weeks I did have a fling with a quality woman but she was coming out of a 5 year engagement so maybe she had red flags as well. when i slept with with her, it was one of my worst sexual performances compared to before. she bailed cause I'm only getting my mba living off that money at the moment until my sports job next spring and cant get anything here right now and also not sure I should retake the bar exam. I genuinely believe emotions do make you weak and I truly didnt give AF about anything on those meds before, but maybe coming off them and finding root causes is a better solution which hasnt worked yet. Maybe the practice of law isnt for me and I'm just becoming more aware of my circumstances, but the correlation between not caring/blunted emotions leading to attracting more women and getting more sex seems to be a real thing for whatever reason. I also do come from a broken single mother home and I'm just trying to figure out if it's better to stay off those old antidepressants and try to fix my life now despite being more anxious, depressed, and not lifting as much (i did lose about 45 pounds though which was only reason I quit them besides some lethargy and wanting new career direction). I wanted opinions from those of you who have had similar experiences on antidepressants or meds or going through professional schooling to find out maybe it isnt for you. Thank you in advance "

Then I learned 'confidence' from a place of weakness (anger phase shit), which turned into confidence from a place of strength eventually (genuine self-confidence/amused mastery/the like). I have genuine confidence now from a place of strength, but it's been hurting me and my relationships (family, friendships, and romantic) by being too cocky and insensitive. This has brought me to the final thing to incorporate, vulnerability from a place of strength. Even Trump said that his dad gave him advice to sprinkle in some softness every once and a while (presumably in his personal life, which we don't get to see). I'm curious about material that more accurately touches upon this phenomena. TRP seems like a nice base but doesn't really give insight or reflect on deep relationships with other people.

Heres the situation: 0.) 27yo, former bluepiller, looking to plate and potentially LTR. 1.) New HB7-8 starts at workplace. There was some looks but we never really talked. She sent out a mass email offering cheap tickets to the entire office for a local show (she says her boyfriend is the opener). 2.) I hit her up about the tickets, immediately after figuring out the logistical stuff, she sends me her # unnecessarily. We talk all day at work from that point on (skype). She is extremely open about her personal life (bordering on TMI), but expressing vulnerability, tons of IOIs, etc. She complains about her BF, talks about how she already broke up with him for a period of time, that hes inexperienced, unmotivated, doesnt know how to deal with me and is basically a super beta. I dont validate or respond to any of this. I change the subject or redirect Were talking 8 hours+ a day(texting after work), she finds excuses to send me lots of selfies, talks about doing creative stuff together (shes the artist type). I fucked up a couple times by offering actual solutions to her problems (Peterson type thought in response to run of the mill Nihilism and Solipsism- made me loose some frame). Her BIG 5 is O-extremely high, C-extremely low, E-extremely high, A-extremely low, N-extremely high. She has suggested we go for drinks the first day we started talking, and I formally asked her after about 3 days (which she talks about looking forward too). Theres definitely some legit attraction (shes a legit gamer), although she is obviously trying to branch swing, and theres no way Im going commit to being that branch without some considerable vetting. I have subtly suggested that her next step (she talks about her options) must be moving out (to even begin considering options). I would consider LTR, but not untill she demonstrates herself. 3.) She lives with her boyfriend, but hes in a hard beta frame, and I can only imagine she is constantly shit testing him (honestly seems like a decent guy  just young (shes 29, hes 22), and he has oneitus BAD. She essentially describes catch 22 shit tests where his only non-beta move would be to walkwhich he isnt going to do due to the oneitus. 4.) TRP has been working wonders in terms of predicting and analyzing her moves. How should I proceed in order to plate or get into LTR consideration? Also looking for tips to avoid friendzoning (she talks a lot about what essentially equates to friendzoning guys- although they all sound like incel betas who loose it because shes basically a veronica. Also she does sound extremely emotionally volatile (see big 5). Also she falls right into my frame (which is pretty solid), but has what amounts to petty grievances about her current LTR - essentially ""he's a beta"". Thanks!"

They are much more emphatic individuals. Given the circumstances, if you ever come across a highly sensitive female who has a multitude of green flags and only one or two red flags, theyre very much LTR material. Heres why: - They are less likely to cheat - They are not as hypergamous as other females - They will rarely shit test you - They are very submissive and shy, making it easier for you to lead and be in control of the relationship - On paper, they make very great mothers - You are able to be emotionally vulnerable to an extent. What I mean by this is that they will understand your emotions better than other females, but they wont use this vulnerability against you. Like the sidebar says, vulnerability is like taking your man points out of a jar. Take too much out and youll still look like a bitch to a HSP. Overall, they are much more understanding and know that deep down, even the most stoic men have emotions. There are several other reasons why, but thats what I could come up with off the top of my head. The only downsides to dating one is that you occasionally have to be careful of what you say or how you say it, as they could interpret something much different than what you intended. Also, a heightened sense of emotion could lead to the cause of anxiety, depression, or other acute emotional/behavioral disorders down the line. This is probably the only thing you should watch out for while dating a HSP. If you play your cards right and if she checks all of your criteria for an LTR, there shouldnt be any problems in the relationship as long as you apply TRP knowledge. These women pair best with men who seek to become the best version of themselves in their craft that eventually would like to become fathers. These women will be by your side with every milestone your reach and any pitfalls you encounter. This is why Ive come to find that HSPs are the only wife-material women out there. What are your thoughts? Have you ever dated a HSP? Let me know what your experience has been like."

I exercised every day, made a ton of friends, and got laid more than I ever have in my life during those years (also went to a party school in a cheap area, so it probably helped). Fast forward after finishing, I worked as a paralegal for a large Law firm moving back home to my city area and realized if I wanted grad school or law school I needed to go right away. I was diagnosed adhd and used adderall to fight my way through the work and was prescribed antidepressants as well like lexapro effexor and wellbutrin. I was dating an absolute dime during Law school when I was on lexapro and adderall and spent my entire last year screwing her instead of going to class and prepping for the bar exam because lexapro impacted my sense of reality without realizing it at least I think. she had no career but a part time job so she moved with me to Washington for my summer job during law school and I took care of her etc. once i wasnt proposing right away and finances got a little tight during bat prep, she cheated on me and left me instantly after 4 years. I had a mental breakdown and havent passed the bar exam since. saw different psychs and docs and was taken off lexapro and put on effexor xr with rexulti wellbutrin for major depression and anxiety along with adderall for adhd and xanax for severe panic attacks and anxiety that left me unable to function. I'm waiting on results from Julys exam right now but not sure I passed again because I recently stopped seeing a psych and my new primary doctor thought I was on too many meds, so when I had my appendix removed recently for rupturing I quit effexor xr and rexulti antidepressants cold Turkey and fought withdrawals while recovering from surgery in the hospital. While I was medicated prior to this I would bang the occasional 7 or 8 but not one woman took me seriously and I started realizing maybe meds have destroyed me more than I realize. Once I got out of the hospital 4 weeks ago I took a quality woman out that has a career and confided in her about my messy past with ex gf coming off meds and how things were now going to come together. She also came out of a 5 year relationship in which she was engaged to a guy that never worked and recently became a cop so she also felt like she supported him like I supported my ex gf. Past 4 weeks recovering and only being on wellbutrin xl xanax and adderall xr, I felt more emotions and authentic, getting closer to this girl all weekend hanging out past 4 weeks and going on interviews. i moved back home until I'm on my feet but I have privacy being I come from a single parent home and my mother is always working but I cant move until I repair my life. she understood and I told her to run but she said she wasnt going anywhere. after our 5th date she came over and we were pretty hammered off wine but she blew me and we screwed although it wasnt my best performance (im either better on more meds or need to regain better natural stamina coming back to myself). we both got off and laughed about it and then she invited me to go meet her sisters their boyfriends and to be a guest at her company sports event. every one of them from her company to her sister to her sisters boyfriends said great things about me and topd her family I was a great guy. she was feeling me but out of no where said we couldn't be serious until I started working again despite her knowing it's only been 4 weeks since quitting major meds I was on for past 2 years. I deleted a pic of me and her on my Instagram and she snapped cried little bit and said that was immature but she was stating the truth and I told her I'll be on my feet soon but if were not serious I'm not advertising her anymore on social media. she wanted me to upload the pic again so i did and we went home very happy with each other. I even picked her up from a bus stop when she got on wrong bus and bought her a gift when she asked for it immediately thinking maybe it was better to be more romantic as I'm in my later 20s and last relationship I was an emotionless monster on lexapro with my dime ex. last week, she calls me Thursday when i find out i wasnt getting some part time bank job although interviewed for bigger position on Friday and tells me i have no sense of direction, discredits any past accomplishments like working in the WH second summer of law school or working for large law firm as a summer associate my first law school summer so I told her I thought she understood I was waking up out of a medicated coma and I'll have a new job here soon as I'm repairing my life, she continued ripping me so I lost it and took a shot at her back because she claimed she was a doctor (shes a physical therapist and my brother and father who I dont speak to are medical doctors) and i told her she wasnt she was a physical therapist she told me I was a doctor too I said no I'm a lawyer got doctoral degree in law but that's not a doctor so relax. I was insulted she seemed to have been surprised I fought back but we calmed down and agreed to take a step back before meeting families. she told me she still wanted to hang out and see me and talk just no family meetings yet till I'm working which I agreed with. going into interview Friday she was wishing me luck asking me how it went and I told her it went very well but then silence the entire weekend last week. I reached out that Sunday and told her maybe we should have made plans and invited her to my family event Sunday if she still wanted to come and she just said enjoy your day with the family so I asked for clarity being things seemed off, she said we arent on same page etc. I told her I was in process of getting it together and thought she understood that but she said she wasnt ready to move forward so I wished her luck and said I wish I didnt confide in her so much. my friends and family were surprised as the past 4 weeks since I got out of hospital and quit those two big antidepressants me and her were inseparable but this came out of no where and I'm assuming it was the fight. Despite family and friends telling me that I'm doing better now and lost weight since coming off two antidepressants, I think my vulnerability and emotions are either hurting me or I'm still healing from what I went through past two years. waiting to land a job and after being put down like that, its only making me question myself more if I should go back or keep fighting forward. If you're going to be negative or tear into me for acting like a beta, try putting yourself in my shoes coming from a broken home, getting my law degree and MBA despite the disaster with meds and having no guidance or anyone around to help you out. I sincerely appreciate the input ahead of time and not sure what direction is the right one anymore. "

To put things simply, I showed my emotions so much that I reduced myself to a groveling piece of trash. It wasn't that I cried and sputtered whenever I was around her, it's just that I was always pussyfooting, showing too much vulnerability, and explaining myself too goddamm much. It wasn't the worst situation you'll read on this sub, but it was bad enough to slink away in shame after learning of rp principles. She removed me on IG, said it was an accident, but never added me back. Come to find out, she's also unfriended me on Facebook. She was always super polite to my face, but I realized she just didn't consider me that important. Or important at all to that matter. I'm a *very* different person now. Not only mentally and emotionally, having matured quite a bit and learned the ins and outs of the sexual marketplace, but also physically. I still get told I look like a model, but I'm too inches taller and twenty lbs buffer than the last time she saw me. Should I reconnect with her? I mean, I don't *need* to, but I want to see if I she'll view me different or if I can turn around my past mistakes. And not gonna lie, I look forward to a badass ""look at me now"" moment."

They avoid eye contact, they don't say hi, they don't talk to me, if I talk to them they seem uninterested, they don't smile or laugh, they fidget with objects or pluck their hair like they are trying to play a harp and I can often hear their breathing become more rapid if we are close together and there aren't many people around. There's nothing positive coming out of them. And what makes it worse is that when I first meet them they are fine with me - they look into my eyes, they talk, they smile, they laugh and then it changes suddenly overnight so it feels like I've done or said something wrong. Especially when they are still their normal selves around other guys. &amp;#x200B; **""Bro, they are actually uncomfortable, leave them alone and learn to be less creepy""**. Yeah, that's my reaction, too. But then I hear from my friends or their friends that they are attracted to me. Their friends say ""she's crushing on you hard, why haven't you asked her out, yet?"" and my friends will say ""all she does is ask about you"". But even though someone else tells me that the girl is just insanely attracted to me and that makes her so closed off because she can't handle the tingles, I never pursue them ever. I just leave them alone because being around them makes me really uncomfortable. I feel like I'm seconds away from being accused of harassment and that feeling starts building anxiety that I know eventually leads into a full-blown panic attack. So I just focus on girls that are comfortable around me - which rationally thinking isn't a good thing because there's no attraction without anxiety and nervousness. Girls are only 100% comfortable around harmless average guys they have 0% attraction towards, right? &amp;#x200B; Some relevant background: 6'1, muscles, shaved head, stubble, been told that I have a resting bitch face but I'm also handsome enough that I get approached by girls in public. Here's the kicker: got accused of sexual harassment years ago when I was AFC as fuck and even though the girl was a mentally ill attention seeker and tried to take the accusation back, the company I worked with still had to investigate. The accusation came as a surprise because I wasn't gaming her. The higher ups were understanding and I knew that I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time but it still left a scar emotionally. So nowadays whenever a girl is nervous around me, I instantly think that ""oh fuck, not again"" and get away from them ASAP. &amp;#x200B; I've been trying to come up with a solution on my own and one thing that came to mind was that I should try to give the girls more comfort AKA be more beta so they open up. Be more attainable, I guess? The problem is, in my formative AFC days when I was way less attractive, I learned that showing any beta traits or vulnerability leads straight to Friendzonetown so I learned to be funny, tough and socially dominating. It's very hard to unlearn that without always feeling like I'm going to get hit with a LJBF if I show any softness or warmth. &amp;#x200B; Also, in the end, do I even have a problem? I can still score girls who have a normal/good self-esteem with no problem because they give me tons of positive signals even though they might act slightly nervous, it's only the low self-esteem ones that behave this way. But personally I feel I should strive to fix this, at least my own anxiety regarding nervous girls. Any tips? "

We went on our first 2 dates in August, 3rd in September. 4th last week and during dates 2-4 I actually opened up and she showed more signs of interest and liked me more. Maybe I have too much of a boyish energy when I open up. But anyway she started liking me more after that, and I thought this could be a good relationship and she asked me out next week but in the mean time invited me to a concert with her and her friends. Went to the pregame for it and maybe I teased her too much, idk what it was but she started getting more distant and distant as the night wore on. When we got there she would distant her self from me and go talk with her friend. I didnt think too much of it and brought her close to me, I asked if she wanted to talk outside from where the music was playing and thats when she told me, I think Ive been leading you on and I feel bad I dont have time for a relationship. At that point I knew it was over but I really want to know what went wrong... I told her that I had been seeing other girls (I have) but that I saw potential for a relationship with her, she responded that there have been other guys too () but she just doesnt have time for a relationship right now cause shes falling behind on graduation and has a lot of sorority stuff going on... I asked her where it went wrong was it me opening up more and she told me that is NOT the case and that I should do that more and it was very attractive and she wishes she met me a year later. Look I know its over with her. I just have this sadness of where did I go wrong? I read all this TRP stuff of status and frame and teasing but a lot of relationships are not like that... her friends In fact just had normal relationships.. I see so many people who we would call blue pill in relationships, yet me, who with the people Im comparing myself too have more red pill awareness and game, is left alone. I keep pointing this to my vulnerability and whether I should always have my guard up or if I should have it down. In the end I knew it really wasnt meant to be with her, we love completely different lifestyles, hers is full of parties and movement and crazy shit; mine is more family and close friends and quiet moments. I cant stop thinking about last night and what really fucking happened AND why I just lack this small elusive space between dating and actually being in a relationship. Every girl that Ive dated its been the building to a relationship part, building to a relationship part and then right when Im ready for the next step, I fall. I keep having self hatred and thinking that this has something to do with my internal energy this part of me that wants to me mothered. If anyone has seen the show Mad Men i feel really connected to those scenes where Don wants to drop everything and leave with whichever mistress he is with and theyre like lol no. And hes left alone. I feel like when I keep this strong manly bravado I get attraction (obviously) but when I open up and the boyish nature and some self deprecation comes out. Boom door closed. What do I do? What am I missing? Sometimes Im too redpill with some girls sometimes Im too blue pilled. Id appreciate support and advice "

And thus have better and an easier time finding people to match with and have casual sex ans overall better life with better relationships with women. And when speaking about vulnerability no not ""boohoo my dad left me when I was young. Help me"" sort of vulnerability...I don't think this is what he is advocating. Obviously you'd need to show that you are stronger or don't care from that kind of thing to a girl. But his idea of qualifying women. Seeing them as just incompatible if they are childish, manipulative etc is interesting in how it relates to TRP. He uses an example of telling a girl he is about to have sex with that be has had a dry spell and might have some performance anxiety as an example of being honest, working. Basically he told the girl that and .... she was turned off but understanding and he said after a few days they got back together and had sex for over six months after that. Because... she was decent, he filtered out with that honesty and she was decent and passed. A girl who would have laughed or shouted would not have been worth the PUA or TRP banter/shit test joking that is so often promoted in that situation. I guess it depends on the tone/ general response of a girl in that situation. My question is this. If Mark Manson says qualify women. He's saved money, time and energy and has had a better time with women because of it. Doesn't that mean the girls we are able to spin, keep on rotation are the type of girls who aren't interested or are unable to hold their ground on monogamy with a guy? Basically, doesn't like attract like? Guy who spins plates attracts girls who do the same, the inverse? Or at least weak girls who can't push for monogamy, exclusivity and such. I mean us guys like virgins right? How can we get a virgin if we are pushing so hard, trying to unlock her chastity belt? What if she was talented, smart, loved you dearly, and just wanted an exclusive relationship that included sex after marriage. On principle and practically. How does TRP prepare for that kind of girl?"

Other than that, I am in no way exagerating when I say she was the kindest person I've met. We had to break up because we go to schools two hours away from each other and summer is ending and LDRs don't work. We may see each other once or twice in the next year but that's it.

I hope it's ok to ask here instead of trpwomen. I'm not interested in female game of trapping a guy in a LTR. But I do want a LTR with it being his decision without pressure and something he'd love to do. Backstory: I was raised in a conservative Muslim family (and was a believing, practicing Muslim up until 5 years ago). I had to get over a lot of religiously oriented sexual shame to consider having a premarital relationship but I finally got into one that lasted 3 1/2 years. It never resulted in any sex but we did kiss and were generally touchy-feely with each other. Now I'm single again and trying to figure out my next steps. I always sort of doubted common ""Western wisdom"" on sex and relationship even after I lost my faith but only until recently thought to actively apply RP principles in my life. Right now I'm in a situation where I want to proceed in the RP way but not sure how. There is a man on the outer peripheries of my social circle that I'm interested in, who seems to be ""blue pill"" philosophy-wise but is a generally confident guy who has sex with various women. He doesn't pedestalize women at all. Maybe purple-pill but not consciously aware of it. I'm not too sure. The main reason I think he's BP is because he's also from a Muslim background and doesn't like the views on sexuality/gender he was raised with and associates many RP views with an ideology he's already rejected in his mind. Anyways, I was very attracted to him and hinted heavily at it, he caught on and said we should hook up. I was a little bit apprehensive but agreed to go along with it because I didn't want to turn him down (I am very sexually attracted to him though). At the time I actually thought he was serious but he tells me later he was joking and I believe him. Well, I guess he was semi-serious and just saying something to get a reaction from me, and he thought ""if it results in sex then great!"" but it's not as if he was seriously suggesting it. We ended up not hooking up. It's a long story and nothing to do with apprehension on my part. However, now I'm a bit relieved because maybe that would have ""cheapened"" me in his eyes before he got to know me personality-wise. But he was disappointed and I felt really guilty he was anticipating to have sex with me for a while and then everything falling through last minute. On the other hand, I already regret being so forward with him or agreed to have sex (even though it didn't pan out). I wish I had just deflected his advance, played it cool and worked on displaying value. He knew I was a virgin after I told him that I would probably be a bit nervous when we hook up. Well, he tells me that he finds nervousness off-putting. He's definitely the type that likes ""sexually confident liberated"" women and I get that mentality isn't BP per-se, but is it possible that due to the fact that he is BP, *wanting to act RP would actually backfire and turn him off? Should I not worry about my past behavior with him and do I explain to him my regret at how I acted or is that too much? I also care about him and feel a kinship with him based on our common culture, language and whatnot and would like to tell him how I feel...but would that scare him off? My confusion comes from the fact that there appears to be two competing RP strategies for women to get a guy's interest 1. Be feminine as possible personality wise, less overtly sexual. Display emotional sensitivity, vulnerability, depth, compassion, etc. 2. Be overtly sexual, hold back emotional cues, be ""cool"" and ""fun"" The 3rd option I'm assuming, is combining both 1 and 2 to build sexual tension with the guy (in a strategic way that doesn't appear slutty) but then be very caring/doting as well. Many TRP guys openly state if a girl doesn't have sex with them, they drop contact immediately. Is this common among non-RP guys? And is that because the girls don't provide any other value? So can I circumvent that by doing other things for him and would that be a fair trade-off? On the other hand, if I don't have sex with him immediately, there's no way he could possibly lose interest in me emotionally due to categorizing me as a fwb, plate, etc. when I would rather date him seriously. Which is my fear with going with the 3rd option. Since the time of us not hooking up, we've talked sporadically online about various things like family, cartoons, FIFA, etc. but not sex. No flirting either. I had to move far away temporarily and that's partly why we couldn't hook up. I'll be moving back soon and want to start things up again. He's initiated contact a couple times to ask how I am, if I'm alright, etc. so my guess is he's at least somewhat interested. But I don't know his full intentions yet. *by ""wanting to act RP"" I meant, for now, I mean withholding sex while displaying value in other ways but I understand this isn't always an ideal strategy. In fact based on what I've read, withholding sex could be BP under certain circumstances. I understand the aim of TRP is for men to maximize benefit from their interactions with women, which a lot of the time means getting sex without a lot of emotional investment. Of course I would also like to ""win"" at my interaction with this guy while having him derive benefit from me. Which is why I don't know whether to have sex, or not, or how much emotionality to display (of which he'd feel pressured to respond to thus ""losing"" especially if he isn't getting sex from me). I don't want to be unfair at all to him. Also do I introduce him to any RP ideas? Thank you so much (yes I'm also slightly neurotic in real-life.)"

In the RP community (please correct me if I'm cherrypicking), a lot of the information is contradictory: many advocate complete honesty / vulnerability in terms of thoughts, actions, and words (Models, etc.), yet the core foundation of RP is rooted in its darker side (Dark Triad)  manipulation and deceit to achieve one's goals if need be. To this end, I've lied about my sexual past (truth is n-count = 0) to first potential dates  to which it helped me get significantly further, then to strangers at parties, and now even to some of my close friends. Essentially, during activities which allow for deep emotional bonding (one on one truth games, hot seat, etc.), I never share who I truly am, and that has hurt me when I freeze up due to inexperience and incongruence later on in the night (even next to a girl in her bed). I realized that at first I did all this for fun as a way to practice on women, which initially worked great, but now it has become a part of my identity which is really difficult to shed, especially to close friends. And no one can tell I'm lying  the other benefits of RP (lifting, diet, etc.) have made it seem expected that someone in my position has had many successes. This has affected my confidence and my frame, as I cannot stand to see myself saying I'm someone who I'm not to impress others. I thought to align my actions with my thoughts: to make truth to what I'm saying, but that is far easier said than done  a feat made harder by the fact that I need to pretend to be someone else in order to maintain my image. No matter how much I fake it, the feeling of incongruence and inexperience can never leave me, and it disgusts me. Is complete honesty the only solution? In my area of business (IB), social image is just as important as being able to tell others what they want to hear in a way that is beneficial to my goals  essentially, a portion of my personal success is through calculated manipulation, which does not seem to align with good personal mental health or sexual success."

Is it too late?",2,8ym082,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/8ym082/38_single_beta_and_lost_is_it_too_late/,2018-07-14 03:35:16,"Thanks in advance to anyone reading this post. I am a newbie here but I am trying to get some help anywhere I can. I am a 38 single guy, well-fit (I believe I am between 7/10 and 8/10 in appearance) with a good engineering career (not wealthy) who had a few situations of Oneitis in his life, the one being a month ago (and by Oneitis I refer to the relationship ending because of me exposing my vulnerability and the need to keep that unique girl in my life), and who has major self-esteem and aging issues. I have been with quite a few women, with most of whom I would have an 1-month sexual-mostly relationship and end it because of the belief that I could do better. Most of these girls were 6s or 7s (I apologize for objectifying women here but I see that in most communities, PUA etc., they are talking about 9s and 10s to describe a woman's appearance, so I will try and give you some idea here as well). Whenever an 8 or 9 would appear in my life that's when the Oneitis would arise and this has happened in total 4 times. After a short 1.5 month relationship with a beautiful girl 10 years younger than me, I hit rock bottom. I am feeling that I am too old to regain my self-esteem and that the years have passed and I won't be able to fulfill my dream to have a healthy relationship with an 8 (as I obviously already feel inferior to her even by looking at her). People believe because I am good at my job that I am an alpha male. I strongly believe that I am a Beta and the Alpha only appears when I flirt with a girl, that the odds look good from the start (from an appearance perspective). Any advise or help would be much appreciated guys as this has started to influence my everyday life in all social aspects of it. Can I fix my confidence and start dating a young beautiful woman at this age? I am really in the dark here. "
82,vulnerability,asktrp,"A Psychology Grad Student's Experience with Vulnerability, Empathy, and Attraction",1,8l7qrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/8l7qrw/a_psychology_grad_students_experience_with/,2018-05-22 15:59:49,"I've only very recently swallowed the red pill, went through the anger, depression, and am working on acceptance and integration right now. Everything TRP teaches overlays well with so much of my experiences that I'm almost upset I didn't swallow the damn thing sooner. That being said, there are a few things taught by TRP that do not correspond with my experience of reality with women , namely that vulnerability and empathy are repulsive to women. A little background I am getting my MA in counseling psychology in a feminist cultured private college that is 70&amp;#37; female and almost half the males are gay. Masculine men are very rare here, I would say that I have only ever met 3 other real alpha personalities in my 3 years of school. We are trained to be vulnerable and empathic as part of the job. I'm good at it. Very good. I really don't give a shit what anyone thinks about me and when I'm in a position where vulnerability and empathy are required of me I don't hold back. I share my honest internal response with people and when I am asked to act as 'the client' and be vulnerable so that someone can practice working with clients I give them my authentic vulnerable self even if it's fucking messy. It helps a lot that I have a talent for communication and a well\-developed emotional vocabulary from a great deal of practice \(this did not come naturally to me as it does not for most men\). Girls. Fucking. Love it. I have had a session where I was the client and told this girl extremely intimate things about how isolating and sad it can feel at times having moved cross country to go to this school and being so far away from anyone who loves or truly gives a shit about me and how difficult it is to form real connections with people in a new city. After the session she gave me her number \(which is extremely unethical in our profession, technically speaking\) and soon after that we're fucking. I'm still plating her 6 months later. Girls are constantly sniffing around and putting themselves in my orbit. The amount of married and engaged women that flirt with me without shame is insane. They literally just can't help it. I don't have a concrete theory around this yet, at least not one that I can fit into a red pill frame as I am still very new to TRP, but I am quite confident that vulnerability and empathy can be carried and owned in a masculine way that does indeed attract and turn women on in a way that game by itself just can't. From what I've read so far I think most people associate vulnerability with weakness and empathy with losing frame. This has not been my experience with either of these. If you are vulnerable in a way that has complete ownership of your feelings, in other words you're not looking for support or nurturing for these feelings and are seeking only their honest and unfiltered expression, it can be extremely attractive to women because it is not coming from a place of weakness. I'm talking about being vulnerable in the same way that an artist is vulnerable, not in the way that a depressed beta who needs a mommy is. There's a very different felt sense that women get about these two kinds of vulnerability. When you own your vulnerability in such a way that it can't be attacked \(like the artist does because the artist creates value through their vulnerability by creating a shared sense of humanity through it\) it is worthy of a woman's respect because it is difficult to do without appearing weak. The seconds it comes off as needy or wanting in any way though, it causes sexual repulsion and/or triggers the nurturing 'mommy response'. Likewise, at least in my experience, empathy is often times respected because is demonstrates social intelligence. Empathizing in such a way that you lose your frame, however, is dangerous and can quickly turn into supplication which is not respected. It's a thin line to be sure, but completely doable in a masculine way and without losing frame. I find that empathizing with a women makes them much more comfortable submitting to my frame as well because it fosters trust. It's also important to note that I only display these things somewhat infrequently to any one person \- maybe once a week at most. I feel like if vulnerability or empathy was just the common experience someone has of me it would be unattractive very quickly as I would no longer be mysterious and my internal life would lose value to them as it becomes easily accessible. All things in moderation. Just wanted to share these insights and observations from my experience with them. I'm sure some people will be happy to tear into them and completely discard these insights and to you I only wish I could show you how much attraction I get on the daily whenever I show masculine vulnerability and accurate empathy. The power it has is very real. It is also worth mentioning that we have an entire section of our program dedicated to how to handle clients that have erotic feelings towards us as therapists because it is so incredibly common for a client to become sexually attracted to their therapist and therapists fucking clients is a surprisingly big issue in our profession. I can write so much more on this and might one day if anyone actually gives a fuck. Just wanted to share those thoughts and spark some conversation. **TL;DR:** It has been my experience that vulnerability and empathy can be VERY attractive to women when it is divorced from neediness or wanting and when it comes from a masculine place and occurs relatively infrequently \(scarcity and mystery create value and challenge\).

83,vulnerability,asktrp,Given TRP why would any guy fake a vulnerability?,30,8q4353,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/8q4353/given_trp_why_would_any_guy_fake_a_vulnerability/,2018-06-11 07:35:24,"So I read some advice which included this: &gt;* She will start asking you lots of questions. This is what chicks do when they suddenly find themselves attracted to a man they know nothing about. This is your chance to open up a little and also find out more about her and build a deeper connection. You have to do this, or she will flake later (even if you've kissed her!) Women are the worst flakes in the world! Don't make it too easy for her, make her work for it a bit. Then talk about connections and childhood memories and things you have in common, etc. She needs to feel that this is genuine. ***This is usually the time when I throw in a few fake vulnerabilities, like pretending I'm shy or insecure about something.*** I know it's fucked up but women need to see that there are at least a few small holes where they can sink their hooks in you. They get uneasy if you are too perfect. Gentleman, this works. The ONLY people I've picked up and fucked recently I consciously followed this advice, thinking to myself, ""God this is so fucked up. I am literally sitting here acting and pretending to be vulnerable about something I'm totally confident in. How fucked up is this."" Gentlemen: the women I didn't do this with, I didn't get farther with. So what the FUCK kind of advice is this given The Red Pill? How is faking vulnerability ""holding frame""? Why is this necessary? Why, or how, can this *possibly* work? The advice is totally, completely at odds with holding frame all the time: but I did that, and was rejected. so....? Explain."

My world shattered when the blinders came off. It is something that keeps on coming back to me. The anger, the shame, the guilt at all the opportunities that I let slip by. I feel a seething rage in me towards society for lying to me, Hollywood for putting all this romanticized shit in my head, my former oneitises for playing me like a fiddle, and myself for being dumb enough to buy into that shit and play along. The white, lonely nights spent staring at the ceiling when everybody else was out on weekend parties. The complete lack of a true, human connection. Nobody has ever invited me to a gathering outside of school, and I've never had any true deep bonds other than the faux-socialization at highschool (e.g. ""hey Dark how was your bio test"". The lack of intimacy and the crippling ridicule / ostracization I got for trying to ascend the ladder and mould myself into the best version of myself. They knew who I was, I can't blame them. I've come a very far way since... Just about every muscle is now starting to show. I've lost my titties. Given up PMO and gaming. Picked up rugby and have been meditating for a very long time. But I still feel very hurt deep on the inside, like I've lost a large chunk of the best part of my adolescence. When I have to sit with these other people in my grade (Junior year) all the hurt, the shame come back and I just barely repress the urge to scream. To cry out and tell them ""the hell with all of you"" and flip over a table or two. To punch the ""best friend"" who betrayed me in a moment of vulnerability and made sure to throw me under the bus to improve his standing with the girls I liked. I've been told not to care what people think of you, but it's hard not to when you have to see these people every single day. After a while, all the flak of being called ""awkward"", or ""rapey"" or ""fake"" and unanimously rejected by both girls and guys, having to sit alone every break because of the stigma of people associating themselves with me. The rugby team is alright, but their group is already tightly knit and I don't think they want to associate themselves with me. It's been a month or so but I haven't been invited anywhere. What to do...? Does the ridicule ever end?"

Something that confused me in the article is that apparently if a woman shit tests you, she isn't even worth your time because she doesn't share your values. Additionally, by responding to the shit test, you are trying to make her like you by using a manufactured shit test response. The book No More Mr. Nice Guy defines a nice guy as someone who tries to make people like him despite his own values, so wouldn't responding to shit tests using agree and amplify or one of the other methods make you a Nice Guy in a way, or am I missing something?"

Though she really often tells things like this in a playful way (so I take that as a shit test) but gets (or acts) butthurt if I amplify (like, okay then... you don't love me.. right.. ) This time, after telling me about her fear of losing me, she asked me what could be the worst thing she could do to me, expecting me to reply the same thing (losing her).. I don't know how to take this.. is she trying to evaluate my level of attachment or just sincerely seeking the same emotional response from me? Got to mention she often ""plays"" with this, probably because I do and often make jokes when she projects herself without me.. but she's pretty insecure inside and legitimately fears losing me. I don't know if I should fully act Red-Pilled and stay away from emotional reactions to her words or just go ""fuck it"" and just tell her I want to be with her and don't want to lose her either. Inside, that's what she probably wants to hear, but I don't know if it could play against me in the long term. Inside I know she's begging for more love from me, would love to hear things like ""I want to be with you and only you"" ""you're my only love"".. and would start crying if I said that, but I don't know if it would kill the magic and the chase - be counter productive. Yesterday we got emotional on the phone and talked about some insecurities she has with herself.. a simple message from me telling her ""I just want you to be herself and be happy .. because I love you"" and she started crying on the phone and apparently didn't sleep for half of the night after this... She's sensitive for sure. **TD;LR** *When dealing with vulnerability, I'm split between the Red-Pill asshole attitude where you're less attached and still manage to ""keep the girl"" because of this, or the legit vulnerable guy who just gives the love his GF asks for and stays honest with himself (the Mark Manson way)* **Maybe I'm a fucking moron for posting such a message, should stop overthinking this and tell her what I feel, but I've seen so much shit here and in r/seduction about guys killing relationships when sharing their true fears and feelings that I'm lost...** Any thoughts?

In general doesn't TRP show that you should hold a strong, stoic frame. I don't think TRP would advocate sharing compromising old childhood memories or so forth. So these two approaches are at odds, aren't they? Basically I'm asking here how Models relates to TRP and specifically the parts about vulnerability and emotional connection. it seems not to be necessary or helpful in a man with strong frame. what are your thoughts?"

During college I was very focused on studies; had 2 long term relationships and didnt really do much outside of those. Those relationships were with girls I wasnt too attracted to, and it didnt really matter to me because I watched so much porn to numb my sexuality. Once I moved here, I became depressed and unsure of what my purpose was in life. I started taking up some hobbies to meet people, and met some cool friends I could hang out with. One day I met an extremely beautiful girl at my apartment. I talked briefly with her before saying goodbye and going back to my room. We matched on tinder that night and started hanging out. From the get-go i was very nervous and anxious around her. My porn addiction and nervousness caused erectile dysfunction which was a feedback loop into more anxiety and nervousness. Despite this she continued to show interest. I had blinders on and was doing basically everything wrong - continuing to watch porn, showing vulnerability, being clingy, being too available. Looking back I believe I was a rebound for her, and Im relatively sure she was seeing other people while we were together. One day we were together and I broke down. I cried and told her how much she meant to me. I felt helpless and afraid, and in response she broke things off with me. I understand why and feel pathetic looking back. This was a few months ago. We had a lot of fun times and I feel like I enjoyed being around her more than anyone else in my life. I dont harbor ill will, but I cant get over things. I still have dreams of her being with me and when I wake up Im thrown into despair. I cut off contact with her but the thoughts of her wont stop. Im without a doubt depressed and am too afraid to tell anyone out of shame. My parents know about the breakup but I dont want them to know how long its been affecting me. Im lifting, trying to be social, and trying to pick up hobbies. Ive also been trying no fap to get rid of this porn addiction. I even have had sex with 2 other girls, but that didnt help. I saw a doctor who recommended a therapist, but the therapist didnt pick up and never contacted me after I left a message I am now in a state where I cant see things getting better. I think about suicide a lot, and am hit with overwhelming waves of sadness when around other people. This happens a lot at work, in restaurants with friends, and even at the club recently with friends. I started watching porn again and am having trouble stopping. Things just feel miserable without any sign of stopping. Im looking for any advice from people who have been in a similar situation, namely advice on how to move on and fix my emotional imbalance"
89,vulnerability,asktrp,Blindsided by LTR after a trip and meeting her mother. What happened?,7,856azv,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/856azv/blindsided_by_ltr_after_a_trip_and_meeting_her/,2018-03-18 07:06:20,"Posting from a throwaway because I'm a public figure. A little about myself - I am a 26 year old veteran and athlete that has come into the national spotlight through para sports and activism. I am a decorated combat veteran that was severely injured about five years ago. I had a long and difficult recovery, but have made strides. I am proud of where I am, but the suddenness of my girlfriend ending and how it ended has me pretty shaken. I am pursuing my education, started a veteran's organization to help other vets do the same and have gotten national press for my efforts. I have met with members of parliament on several occasions, played a part in the national Remembrance Day ceremony, speak at schools frequently and on a board for disabled veterans. My former regiment has named a trophy after me, and I have received a promotion and award from the head of my country's military in a large, publicized ceremony. However, I still make a corporal's pay ($50k in garrison - $100k overseas). I don't mind as I have my education paid for and want to decompress after the experiences I went through in the service. In addition, after being unable to walk I motivated myself to drive through physio therapy and beyond, taking up two sports. I devote most of my time to training, being on 2 varsity university teams, 2 competitive teams, and the national para team. Last summer I won a national title in sprinting. In addition to this I taught myself a language, and instrument and to dance. The media loves a good veteran story so I have received quite a bit of national press in TV, Radio, Newspapers and the like. I don't like the attention personally, but it gives me a platform to help other vets. The focus of my interviews is always to thank the people who helped me and to draw attention to veterans that often go ignored. My attitude has always been that I shouldn't have to sprint national times to raise awareness of issues facing vets, but things are what they are. For the entirety of last summer I was training for an international para competition for injured veterans. This is a fairly well known one, supported by a member of the British Royal Family. I was selected for my national team the previous November, and devoted my life to training. I spent a significant chunk of my disability award of coaching and personal training, and put in 4-6 hours a day. I do not drink alcohol when I train, I eat a clean diet, and I go to bed early. This somewhat limited my personal life, although I was able to pick up women very easily essentially whenever I wanted either through Tinder/Bumble, or chatting with them in class/at the training venues. I met a 27 year old woman in August. I was a speaker and athlete at the Army Run, and she is an amateur runner. She is an intelligence officer who also is the editor of an award-winning local blog. Between these two jobs she makes $80k. She also is involved in one of my sports at a recreational level, as well as dragon boat, a running club, an instagram club, and runs the social media accounts for our city's (1M, national capital) tourism and a few other things. She is often paid for her photo submissions. She owns a very nice house that she bought when she was only 25. When we met, because of our shared passion for sport we immediately hit it off. She initially struck me as a bit of a braggart. Coming from the combat arms, I prefer quiet professionalism but in my experience women in their mid twenties who are starting to make ""real"" money like to show off their accomplishments. I was impressed by her hustle, but noticed she was spending most of her time working or doing her various activities. I like alpha women, but I came from a military family that prioritised achievement above all else and I find it a little discomforting. She also carried her (very expensive) camera with her at nearly all times, and many of our dates felt like photos ops. As I said, I begrudgingly tolerate media because of my public life, but in my personal life I like to just unwind. She Instagram'd almost every single meal we had, often rearranging drinks, menus etc. for the shot. Whether we were going for a fall walk, to a museum of whatever, she was taking and posting photos across all kinds of media. I have had to create social media at the instance of a military Public Affairs Officer, and its all public. I gave my girlfriend the password to my twitter account and she was pretty eager to run it. In September, I went into competition and she was head over heels about me. She posted and took many great photos of me, DVR'd the competition to get shots of me, found every single news article, tv interview, radio that I did during competition. Everything, she seemed to be all-in. When I came back I decided to commit to her. I don't think I'd ever felt a woman to be this into me. Attracted, sure but she was as I said involved in every aspect of my ""story"". I thought that most women were only superficially interested, either in my athletic body, achievements, or publicity and that she was different. It was that thought process that guided me towards a LTR. She insisted we film an audition video for the Amazing Race. They were focusing on wounded warriors and first responders. I didnt want to, but she was crazy about it. We submitted and I went back to my regular life but she was crushed when we didnt get it. I really felt like she was over the moon for me. After competition I went back to school, continued my work, and recovered from exhaustion and training injuries. I felt the post-competition crash they warn you about in training camp. On top of that of course are my physical and psychological injuries. I began to bring my meds over to her place, and slept with headphones in because of the tinnitus and flashbacks. At this point I also received my discharge date. This was incredibly hard for me as I have given years of my life to the military, as well as the physical cost. I received many job offers, admissions to schools and so-on but I was trying to have a semblance of stability. I didnt want to move because I thought we could really build something. I turned down a union apprenticeship so I would stay in the same city. I was pretty depressed between December-January, but rallied. An Army buddy and I decided to put ourselves through a special forces PT plan, just like we were back in battalion. I started to feel like my old self again, and while depressed that my career was over, felt good about where I was in life. My attitude was that my life wasn't where it would be if I wasn't hurt, but I had achieved a lot more than anyone expected in my recovery, and was helping other vets who had it worse. By February she had met my parents on several occasions, and I had met her father - a telecom executive (60s)- and brother (Early 30s M) - a silicon valley programmer. They were both very impressive but I felt like I built rapport with them. Over the holidays my girlfriend excitedly showed me to her family on facetime, sent them newspapers and magazines that featured me, and her family began to follow me on social media. I got the feeling as I said that this was a goal and achievement oriented family, but as I mentioned I feel like I've done enough for my country and myself that I can take the time to get my head right as I go through a major life change. In this time she got a major promotion and moved to a different department of the government, still in intelligence but at the level where she briefs ministers and the prime minister. I was very proud of her for this, although I am not a careerist. I was always happy as a private, and even becoming a corporal for me was not a big deal. I feel like my decorations say more about me than my rank. I should also mention that we had been having less sex after her promotion. My girlfriend often got tickets and promotions because of her social media activity, and she won an all-expenses paid trip to a city across the country for a major sporting event. This included airfare, a fancy hotel, VIP tickets, meals at fancy restaurants etc. About two weeks before we went, she told me she had convinced these people to also include her mother (late 50s F) and sister (22F), who would fly out from the other coast to meet us there. I felt like this was a big relationship hallmark (our second big trip together and meeting the rest of her family) and looked forward to it. I was a little concerned because the trip included a helicopter ride and I hadn't been in a helo since my deployment, and it would be my first airplane trip since flying overseas as well. Having said that, I talked to my friends, my shrink etc. and decided to make the effort both to face these triggers and to tell her about them. When we were at the airport I told her that after our time together I wanted her to be a bigger part of my life, and that would mean knowing things I do not like to talk about. I told her some details about my deployment, injury and PTSD and thanked her for being so supportive. She seemed distant and even disinterested during this conversation. In previous relationships, or even telling my friends and family these stories, people usually cry so her muted response was a surprise to me. I had a hard time reading her reaction. Once we arrived I met her mom and sister. At first things seemed to go pretty well. However her mother immediately began to rub me the wrong way. She was a grown woman and also spent most of her time on twitter, instagram, taking photos of every activity, and so on. She was also a braggart, and was very happy with the ""swag"" we were provided with. Each of us received a $200 gift card for a major shopping centre, but the mother took them all and gave them to my girlfriend saying ""coming with her on the trip is a reward enough"". My jean's inseam had torn at the airport and I mentioned that I could probably use a new pair and got a withering glance from both women. Her mother also did my least favorite thing, as a veteran. Within 20-30 minutes of meeting her she was asking specific questions about my deployments, injuries, ptsd, combat, if I had killed anyone etc. I usually get these questions for elementary age schoolchildren but even high school students typically know better. Her attitude and style of questioning also bothered me. It felt like I was being judged and found unworthy. She also threw her other daughter under the bus by casually disclosing information about her mental health, seemingly to justify why she hadn't achieved as much as the other two children. I felt very bad to this other daughter and related to her. In one instance the mother was talking about how she had won $15k from a contest and lavishly spent it on my LTR and her brother. I saw a look come across the younger daughter's face and asked what she had got. She said ""nothing"". The mother insisted that she had, but the younger daughter quietly and pleadingly maintained that she hadn't. The mother just causally said ""oh well I'll get you those boots you want at the mall."" As I said I felt a sympathy for her. I've often felt like a bit of a loser over the past few years, but have had my confidence built up through success. Still I feel a lot of sympathy towards people who feel like they aren't enough. The way the mother talked to the youngest daughter made my skin crawl. The itinerary of this trip was exhausting and both the other daughter and I went to bed early each night. I don't drink both because of medication and because I have seen many vets with PTSD go down that path. The first night my girlfriend and her mother went to a fancy bar to drink and talk and my girlfriend came back several hours later. We didn't have sex for the duration of our trip which struck me as odd because on previous trips we had had fantastic sex. I also got the sense from things her mother said that my girlfriend was sharing details about me I'd rather not get out, and she made many negative comments. She would say things like ""Oh my daughter makes so much money because she works hard"" and commented on how she was the top of her class in high school and university and had to carry less intelligent classmates in group work. This kind of talk was often interposed with pointed questions about what I would do next with my life, next career and so on. As the weekend wore on her mother was increasingly disrespectful, dismissive and outright rude to me. On one occasion I asked if I could spend time with my girlfriend and she said ""oh no I won't let you separate us"". My girlfriend also grew even more distant, to the point where we were hardly talking. All the while her and her mother are having a great time, taking photos of everything and so on. I went for several long runs and to the gym to keep up my training and cool my head and my absence went unremarked and maybe unnoticed. Finally at the airport after I said goodbye to her family and stood with our luggage at the gate, she stood with her mother and talked for 10-15 minutes often looking over in my direction. It made me feel uneasy. She didn't say much to me after that, including the flight home. We just ubered to her house and went to sleep. In the morning she insisted I go off to class and said she was having brunch with friends (she had taken the day off). Again, it seemed like she was trying to get rid of me. When we flew back I talked to my friend's and shrink about this and they suggested I talk to my girlfriend. Between our return and Tuesday the only text I had gotten from her was to arrange afternoon coffee before her run club. This was an immediate red flag for me. I can't really explain why but between what and when the plan was, I felt a kind of suspicion. Of course I was also planning on talking to her at this point because my friends and therapist insisted that how her mom talked to me was totally unacceptable, that Im not a loser, that I am worthy and that my partner should not allow anyone to talk about me like that. She didn't kiss me as a greeting and our conversation was stilted. She suggested we go for a walk (it was -10 c) I decided to just speak my mind. I said I had a problem with how her mother behaved, that I know my life isn't where I would like it to be, but I'm proud of my service, even if it has meant that I don't make a great salary, that I had tried to let her in on these feelings and that at this point if she wanted to be a part of my life she had to know about the consequences and pain behind the fame and accolades. She said she had wanted to talk to me and said she felt that things weren't working out. She said that we had different priorities (she specifically mentioned time and money), she said that she was bothered that she was doing things alone that she'd rather do with her boyfriend, a few other things like that. It felt, rehearsed? I pressed and said that all of those things could be worked on if she had been willing to communicate. I said that I am willing to work on these things, but I had the sense that she was justifying checking out. She agreed that she had, and said that her reason was ""we are at different places in life"". That really burns. It's not like I'm a scrub, a deadbeat or a stoner. I bled for my country, nearly died and have spent every day of the past few years healing and helping other veterans. I have gone from paralysis to winning national athletic titles. She said she had already been thinking about this before the trip. I asked why even bring me? I told her that I had spent weeks in therapy to get on an airplane again, let alone a helicopter. She said ""if I had known I would have asked someone else to come."" I was hurt. I really felt like I was willing to put the work in but if things weren't just-so with her, she was indifferent. I held frame the whole time, and really did feel like it was a Seinfeldian break-up, you know shake hands and move on. However, as we were leaving she said ""I'm looking forward to reading about you in (National Newspaper)"". The story will run next week, but I had been interviewed and photographed the previous few weeks. It was very hard to have the focus on me specifically and not on sport, but opening up to the reporter helped me open up more in therapy and to my girlfriend. She often brought up this story in the last few weeks, as it is a major feature in a national newspaper, but I kept telling her it made me uncomfortable and that I am only doing it to further other vets. I don't celebrate fame, and I certainly don't seek it out. Anyway, after she said that I felt a revulsion I have never felt before. It was like in one shining moment I went from loving to loathing someone. I said ""If there is one thing you learn about me from reading a newspaper than this has been a waste of my time. I am not my medals, I am not my athletic awards, I am not the trophy named after me, I am not any of those things. I am not TV, or Radio, or Twitter about me, I am not press, I am not commendations. I had a hard time opening up to that reporter but the hardest thing I've ever had to do, the thing that meant far more to me was opening up to you one-on-one."" She started crying and sobbing, said she had to go, and that was that. I haven't contacted her since. I'm just left wondering, what the hell happened?! My friends insist she only saw me as a famous athlete and was only attracted to the fame and glory. I feel such a deep sense of loss and betrayal. It's hard for me to balance the public and private aspects of my life, and even harder for me to open up and show vulnerability. I feel like an idiot most of all.I let her in and I wasn't good enough for her or her mother. I have worked hard to be where I am today, hell I nearly died! To have that discarded as not enough makes me feel like I'll never be good enough, or at least never be the person people think I am. It makes me resentful of sports and media for building me up just to be torn down in my personal life. tldr: My ex-girlfriend is a high achieving woman who lives her life through media. I am a wounded warrior who is still putting the pieces of my life together. We met at the peak of a media circus around me, and it seems like she fell for the story not the man. Once I started to let her in she abruptly left me. "

"" ""Actually I know you don't love me"" ""- ..But maybe it's just that.. you know you can tell me if it's the case.. - What? ""Maybe you don't really love me after all"" (then stares deep in the eyes) I know she's playing when she acts like this, but she might have back thoughts, like thinking I'm not loving her the way she loves me. But this needy, loving, almost childish behavior boggles me. Maybe it's her way to ask for love, I don't know. Most of the time I kiss her hard as a pledge of answer but right after she insists: ""so? I'm waiting for your reply"" like she perfectly knows the answer but wants to *hear* it. ""- How do you love me??"" -You don't have a clue"" That's really cliche but I've already replied this once or twice. She wants some kind of ""proof"" of love from me but the more I will give her what she wants the less she will ask for it. That's not something I want. *I like the current state our relationship is in: she asks for more love and affection, and not the opposite.*  So this emotional investment &amp; vulnerability question comes to mind: How do I manage my vulnerability and honestly show my feelings (we're in a relationship, FFS) to her without falling in the trap of the needy beta that shows too much love and gets boring? Where to draw the line? Thanks guys and sorry for the nooby question. I've asked this in other subs and got really mixed replies and opinions. "
91,vulnerability,asktrp,Red Pill and Relationships,2,89ub9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/89ub9b/red_pill_and_relationships/,2018-04-05 08:37:19,"Been lurking in TRP for a little while and a few recurrent questions keep popping in my head: - Will all women eventually cheat on or dump their beta man at some point? Then why and how some healthy and long (sometimes lifetime) LTRs work, while the dude is a complete beta? How the f*** his woman remains faithful until they break up or one of them dies? It surely exists, but how does it even work? I know a dude who's been with a girl in the same school than him since 3 years, and he's the perfect example of the complete beta (waiting her for hours until she leaves school at 19:00 instead of doing something else, texting her every single hour of the day, being jealous when she talks to other guys...) They even live together in the same appartement to go to school together. Usually such a LTR should fuck up at some point. So either she's already cheating on him, either some women actually like boring relationships and beta bucks? - I often see on TRP guys saying women cheating can't be blamed for being women and wanting alphas instead of beta bucks. That's true, but assuming you've swallowed the pill and maintain frame in your relationship, why would the girl dump you for someone else if you fill all her needs (sex, fun, status...) ? Just boringness? Randomly finding another alpha looking even better? Hypergamy for the sake of it? Considering women *can't* be faithful eternally, due to their nature, how the hell some relationships last forever? - I'm currently in a relationship since 3 months, and I'd say it's looking good, the girl is investing more and she can't help but thinking I don't appreciate her as much as she does, that I'm seeing other girls, etc.. I've never shown too much vulnerability or never ""confessed"" to her, shown flaws or insecurities. Justly, that's the opposite. She's the one that, in the back of her mind, questions my love, thinking she must not be good enough for me, wondering why I'm staying with her. She talks about her insecurities, sending me messages everyday to keep in touch, talks about travelling together. Funnily, with other people, she's the type of really social girl that shows confidence and is almost authoritarian. I'm not here in this relationship to screw up anything and don't want tables to turn, me becoming the needy guy and her loosing all her attraction for me. But, with so much investment from her side, should I change anything to my state of mind? I most of the time act stoic to some of her advances, remain distant and not needy when I'm supposed to, and it drives her crazy. She already told me she doesn't know how to read me sometimes. For how long can I keep behaving like that? When do I start investing a bit more to make her understand I take this relationship as seriously as her? I don't know what could kill attraction. The lack of reciprocate investment or me slowly becoming too much invested until she doesn't want to chase me anymore? Thanks guys and sorry for the messy post."

93,vulnerability,asktrp,Is this advice on Frame-control smart?,1,83x2mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/83x2mr/is_this_advice_on_framecontrol_smart/,2018-03-13 05:08:09,"This is the advice: &gt;Controlling the Frame comes naturally from believing you are superior to others, as you would do if you were dealing with children. Search the Manosphere for ""Amused Mastery"". Start with the post with that name on The Rational Male. To develop Amused Mastery, you need to develop both the feeling that you are the shit, the PRIZE (which comes easier if your SMV actually is high), and the feeling that the woman you interact with (or any other people you interact with) are just children. Whenever you deal with someone, think of which way you actually ARE superior to them (Age? Job? Salary? Skills at playing pool?) and focus on JUST THAT. Force yourself thinking there is nothing else that is relevant (Her beauty? Irrelevant. His business? Irrelevant). The belief that your reality and your perspective is more important and accurate than that of others will naturally flow from there. &gt;But the problem is that when you successfully do this, you can easily be seen as arrogant. Which is not necessarily an issue in women's attraction, but is an issue for anything else (women's sense of security, your reputation, etc.) &gt;That's where the second part comes is. Resisting giving the impression that you are controlling the Frame consists in giving hints to people that you are NOT leading them, or treating them as children (when in fact you are). This is the response: &gt;Terrible advice. You're only fooling yourself with this. This is how 12 year olds act to assert status in elementary school. Actual high status people don't act like this. They're calm, confident, and reward people with their attention and interest. They don't have to put of a ridiculous charade in order to appear cool - they know they're the shit. &gt;Guys who try to ""Control the frame"" are exhausting to be around. Treating people around you as children by using techniques such as ""Amused mastery"" makes it very obvious that you're trying to act as if you're better than everyone. Even if you drop all of these ""hints"" that you're not doing this on purpose - you'll find that people will simply stop hanging out with you if you act like this. They'll see you as a tiresome, slightly narcissistic man who you can't have a real conversation with because he's always preoccupied with trying to be ""the best"" in the room. &gt;I would say a very potent and superior alternative to these ideas is the idea of (vulnerability and polarization)[URL by Mark Manson. It's basically being comfortable in your own skin expressing yourself honestly with the risk of rejection (without hiding behind coping techniques such as ""Amused Mastery""). You will become, and be seen as - confident, consistent and trustworthy."
94,vulnerability,asktrp,7 questions to Rollo and TRPs,8,7l510x,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/7l510x/7_questions_to_rollo_and_trps/,2017-12-21 09:36:22,"After a long time in the manosphere, I have few remaining, crucial questions to u/Rollo-Tomassi and would like to kindly ask for his insights. Answers from other sub contributors are welcome as well. Dear Rollo, I'm an avid fan of your work and consider ""The Rational Male"" series a top contribution to the Red Pill, which I perceive as a protoscience of complex gender dynamics in the broad socio-political context. Can I kindly ask you to briefly address these 6 neglected questions? Answers would be extremely helpful for many men trying to gain an in-depth understanding of TRP. 1. Since the first romantic pursuits and a long time before reading the famous ""Women in love"", I've been intuitively noticing a mismatch between the male and female styles of love. For a romantic man under the standard social conditioning, it feels like a fundamental, underlying ""unsatisfactoriness"" resembling the Buddhist concept of _dukkha_. **Could you provide me with some good research papers from various disciplines suggesting, confirming or describing the different, opportunistic character of female-to-male love?** 2. Furthermore, while men and women can't have a direct access to each others' subjective experiences (qualia) in terms of experiencing love, I wonder if we could design a thought experiment for gaining mutual understanding and **encompassing these differences at a gut level**. It might be interesting to study groups of men, women and trans people with different SMVs, attachment styles (secure, anxious, avoidant), orientations (homo-, hetero-, bi-), as well as asexual and aromantic individuals. Are there any ideas which come up to your mind? 3. I decided to maintain the life-long MGTOW Lite policy (stay unmarried and childfree, avoid falling into the common law marriage and false accusation traps, thus prioritizing my self-ownership). I don't cross out the possibility of enjoying short-term and long-term romantic relationships. I am, however, anxious about the far future when I might need support and a safety net due to the potential adverse life circumstances, including health and financial issues. While marriage certainly doesn't guarantee help and reassurance for men, my MGTOW friends also worry about the unpredictable downsides of staying childfree bachelors, surviving the inevitable loss of their close family members (with the last unconditional, irreplaceable bonds), as well as thriving through the upcoming decades in the age of self-perpetuating social polarization, isolation and distrust. **Can you recommend any good safety measures or remedies we can take in our late 20s / early 30s?** 4. My impression is that most men don't genuinely embrace the Iron Rule of Tomassi #1, as their obsessive focus on Game is a manifestation of underlying neediness; subreddits are full of posts unnecessarily re-iterating the same basic concepts and seeking non-existent ""one weird tricks"", and that's why the manosphere offers rapidly diminishing returns. In addition, many of the wannabe-pickup artists fall into the codependent-narcissist trap which has been perfectly described in The Rawness post (URL We want True Romance and Intimacy to happen. The more we want them, the more needy we are, and the harder they are to pursue. Contrary to the Manson's claim, vulnerability is not a key to attractive non-neediness, but a good addition when you earned your macho tokens as a men with a high SMV and are now considered as a long-term match aka a ""tamed alpha"" archetype. **Is there a different, valid way of breaking the clear trade-off between wanting and neediness, between increasing DMV and outcome independence?** One can always dive into the Stoic and Buddhist teachings on non-attachment, but I'm not sure if it's healthy or achievable to get rid of the natural craving for romantic love and intimacy. Should we strive for finding individual sweet spots to reduce the effects of vicious circle? 5. The rapid changes on dating market, perpetuated by cultural shifts and social media, resulted in a total confusion and self-perpetuating chaos. While the Marriage 1.0 might have been the best stable configuration for solving all the major coordination problems in heterosexual relationships, it will never be socially reinforced again. Monogamy is in decline, polyamory is hijacked by SJWs and further perpetuates dating market inequalities, increasing men's disposability and intrasexual competition. **Do you see any major social alternative model that may work, like the assortative, regulated evo-psych polyamory?** 6. Would you agree that despite the extensive knowledge related to open hypergamy, dual mating strategy and evolutionary psychology, **relationships are still really mysterious at the level of individual cases**, given that no-one has examined the core nature and dynamics of romantic infatuation? See: URL URL As a side note, any **protips for increasing the DMV/social status** of a sensitive 26 yo guy with sort of average attractiveness (6/10), struggling with really strong anxiety and psychosomatic complaints? Therapies may help a lot in damage control, but I realistically don't expect full recovery or a strong inner game. Diverse passions, intellectual and a sense of humor might be helpful in some niches."

But am starting to question the validity of the redpill on multiple levels, first , is it really a valid way of living globally ? men and women are not the same everywhere , redpill came out as a solution for the western 3rd wave feminism, I can agree that hypergamy is on motion everywhere, but on some level the redpill is more applicable to western society. Second, I wonder if the redpill works on long run , lets face it we all have a wall , after 50 we will all hit one , we might hit it later than women but still denying there is a wall is not a little hard to grasp , even doing your best and being in good shape , still being 50+ is not an easy deal to pickup strangers or even settle down. Third, this was the part that got me to question everything , I see Mark Manson's Model's suggested alot here , I didn't read the book yet but I listened to one of his podcast and he is recommending vulnerability which is something very frowned upon by redpill , he mentioned that he discovered this because he found that after living the lifestyle of PUA sleeping and traveling around the world he found it all depressing. and it improved the quality of relations. There is also Rooshv, I listened to one of his podcasts and he is started talking about hedonic treadmill, and how he tried to make it work on LTR but it didn't work , he described his past life as empty and meaningless. This all got me to question the whole thing. Plus as the title said , I'm 30 and part of me feels like I'm old and want to settle down , I don't know , set me straight guys if I'm wrong"

TRUST AND BELIEVE WOMEN - don't use your power to get women's attention/company/sex/etc - if you get asked to be on a panel/team and see that it's all men, say something. maybe even refuse the spot! - be aware of your inherent power in situations and use it to protect women, especially via talking to other men - stop thinking that because you're also marginalized or a survivor that you cannot inflict pain or oppress women - stop thinking about how women's pain makes YOU feel pain - don't read a list like this and think that most of these don't apply to you That's it.

It's a theory I want to test and get advice on. It feels terribly blue though. So advice, bros! A chick that seemed really into me stayed over and put up LMR which I couldn't diffuse. The next morning I ignored her as much as I could and mumbled a few words to her attempts at making conversation. She cuddled up to me to get some attention so I told her no cuddles, pulled out my phone and started texting another chick for her to see. She tried giving me a foot rub and kept asking for a hug. I kept ignoring her and she was asking who is the girl I'm texting is, where did you meet her, do you like her more than me etc. I was aloof with her. Then eventually she said 'well you've clearly moved on' then she started texting on her phone. We both ignored each other until she said bye and left. **First question**, did I play this freeze out wrong? I didn't want to give her the attention she was craving. We haven't been in touch since (5 days). It's gone from her calling me daily to nothing. I'd usually hard next. **Second question**, she's alpha so I don't know if the usual techniques work? Or maybe I should stop kidding myself and she saw me as a orbiter despite her seeming very interested? The theory and final questions... I've since read Models by Mark Manson. I want to try his honest, direct approach that shows vulnerability. My bro, with a super hot girlfriend, naturally does what Mark Manson teaches. My bro has a canned text he sends out that only has a 50/50 success rate, but he made a good point that if she rejects you then she clearly wasn't that interested in the first place. So, here is the stomach churning text he suggests I send (modified for my situation): ""I was off the other morning because things with us aren't progressing** how I expected. I know for a fact we enjoy each others company. So let's go out to XYZ and then back to my place? But this won't work if you want to be a platonic friend."" **disclaimer: she knows I don't want commitment from a previous discussion we had. I'm basically asking for sex. Feels wrong. But having thought about it, is this solid inner game? Going after what you want, not giving a shit about whether she agrees or not. There's no neediness in that text. Just honesty and a bit of vulnerability. And is vulnerability even vulnerability if you don't give a shit? Or stick to what I know? The good old RP theory. The old 'act like NOTHING has happened' when we get in touch again?"

103,vulnerability,asktrp,Should I admit to my lack of experience?,1,6nmozm,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/6nmozm/should_i_admit_to_my_lack_of_experience/,2017-07-17 01:20:58,"I've been lifting now for close to three years over a five year period (on and off training), and manage a portfolio of retail footwear stores. I drive a nice car, and ride a motorcycle. I was a dancer, and a gymnast, and tend to be very social and outgoing, knowing how to work a room at parties or business events. Having said that, I am by nature, an introvert, I mention all this so you understand that I am already well-dressed, confident, somewhat successful in my early career as a 23 year old. The problem though is that everyone assumes that I am successful in dating, and that I fuck a lot of women. The truth is, I am very good at first dates (kiss closing them early) but I am too scared to go further because I lack experience in the bedroom. I don't want to undermine all the hype and build up beforehand simply because I lack confidence in my skills when it comes to foreplay or intercourse. Especially, when women see how confident and flirty I am when we first go out. Thus, I end up leaving or abandoning the girl before things go any further. I am not a virgin, but the five girls I have bedded was from two cruises I have taken over the past two years, who I will never see again so I didn't care about them judging me in the bedroom. Everything I have read on TRP seems to suggest that admitting my lack of experience in intimacy to a girl will direct her to a chink in the armour and see vulnerability, and is not a good idea. BUT, when it comes to sales, the cards are typically in your favour when you admit to being new to the job because customers willingly let their guards down and allow you to work your charm, slow them down and work them through the road to a sale. There are only two people in my life who know about this insecurity, and they were both surprised when I told them this because not once have they ever seen a chink in my armour before. Letting them into this secret feels empowering, but even still, should I admit to my lack of experience so that women are more understanding of my lack of skill? Or should I fumble my way through, acting confident and self-assured?"

I was hoping that we could gather some great A&amp;A examples in this thread to help illustrate the concept. I also want to know what you guys think about A&amp;A...when it works and when it doesn't. Here's one example from **[this](URL post: &gt;A shit test will be instituted when a girl seeks to test your fitness and this will take the form of a rapport break. A girl will ask a question or make a statement, usually diminishing your position (either explicitly or implicitly), and will gauge your reaction. For example, a shit test I recently received at a music festival: &gt;*I bet you have a small dick. Of course. Leaves me more space to sneak in drinks.* Note: I later hooked up with this girl. &gt;To male logic, agreeing with the shit-test acknowledges a fault and indicates a lack of fitness. This logic forms the basis of the blue pill idea that we should conceal our weakness. The same blue pill reasoning would ask, How is it youve just admitted to having a small dick, and this girl is now more interested? However, to those with red pill awareness it is evident that the true confidence displayed, rather than the content of the conversation, is what generated the attraction. Whether I have a small dick or not is irrelevant. Furthermore, amplification to absurdity was not necessary. *Rather, I have displayed vulnerability in agreeing to a fault, but obvious strength in the fact that Ive accepted it and clearly do not care what her position on the matter is.* I'm not sure exactly how A&amp;A is supposed to work in all contexts, though. As it says above, sometimes a girl will ask/state something that ***implicitly*** diminishes your position; in other words, shit tests are not always so easy to understand and respond to and can be quite sneaky. **[Here](URL is a comment that challenged whether A&amp;A is a good tactic: &gt;If you want to talk about why shit tests work you may want to incorporate frame into your argument. You can think of a shit test as a certain frame that the girl is attempting to impose onto the interaction. Your goal should be to have the entire situation controlled by your frame. Essentially you should not resist or argue her shit tests, instead make them your own. &gt;When a girl says you have a small dick, if you agree and amplify you effectively allow the girl to feed into your frame. If you let her frame feed into your frame, or say no we go by my frame, you have passed the shit test. **[This](URL comment gives some great examples: &gt;Agree and amplify is about destroying a shit test by blowing it up and making a joke out of it: &gt;You look pretty young. Yeah, I'm getting my braces in next month. &gt;Are you hitting on me? Yeah, do you think we should have a big wedding, or just invite our closest friends and family? &gt;How much have you had to drink? All of it...there's no more left. It's all about being a smart ass, and ***how*** you say it is everything: one suggestion was to ""Be a passive smart ass with a chuckle and a smile."" "

I never expected to be back here but its the only place where I can get some serious advice. I used to go through redpill a lot back in the day, then I got super depressed and thank god decided to turn my life around by practicing positive thinking. From then I started meditating, reading books on business, self-improvement, lots of podcasts(art of charm, etc) and lots of audiobooks..Also finally feel like I got over binge eating. I've never looked back. Well coincidentally an old fwb hit me up(I used to be a complete ""douche"" to her) and we got together just to have sex(at first)..This lasted 3 weeks until last week where she completely cut contact. I couldn't hold it in anymore, as I didn't understand why and sent her a text saying I still want to see her, and opened up a bit vulnerability wise. She said she wanted to be alone and learn and apologized, etc, etc. We ended it in good terms. Yet deep down I did expect her to in a way change her mind and come back to see me..And the fact she just stopped texting me once we essentially said our goodbyes hurts. I know its partially scarcity mentality speaking, and I know the best answer is ""spin more plates"" but it sucks. I'm trying to accept the feeling like when I meditate but its hard because in the back of my head I hear ""She doesn't think you're good enough anymore"". It seriously stings as I always thought she was head over heels for me and this non caring attitude she's giving off makes me feel like I wanted her more. It's that ""You want what you can't have"" Edit: In retrospect, being more self-aware, I can feel that my real emptiness and pain with this comes from a girl that gave me what I have been wanting leaving. I haven't had much luck in general and so inside I tell myself ""Now how are you going to get a girl to do the same"", its not so much her, but the act of sex, the touch, the feel, and the adrenaline rush I get from feeling desired sexually and emotionally"

One who unapologetically expresses how he feels and says what he thinks, which all ties into the concept of vulnerability. On the other hand I've also read that vulnerability is exposing one's weaknesses, and that being a vulnerable man who expresses himself freely is just an idea pushed by the feminization of society. I realize that there are subtle differences between the two. A congruent man who relentlessly goes after a girl is seen differently from a vulnerable man who confesses his love for a girl. Congruent behaviour is attractive or not unattractive, and requires vulnerability, but some vulnerable behaviours are unattractive. How can you tell the difference? Is it something you learn through experience? Then there's also being an emotional rock. The stressed out man who refuses to share this information with his wife and pushes on forward is seen to be more attractive than the same man who expresses his stressed out position then pushes on forward. In this case what is congruent attractive behavior? "

Selfish with her time and tries to guilt trip me in. Basically she knows she can get away with it. When I have her by the balls is when I don't answer her for a couple days but act totally indifferent and not butt hurt. If for example, when she doesn't answer me.. and I say... ""Hello, where are you"" and do the same thing she does to me... is this beta? Sometimes I think I am too cold and never show vulnerability and she just assumes I am just gaming another girl since I dont put up a fight or dont really get bothered by it. She seems to always come back but shes young and obviously isn't ready for anything serious, and I think I'm Beta Bucks but she still sleeps with me here and there which is cool. We also talk on the phone and I do enjoy her in my life as I think she does with me as well, but she knows there is no way we can be ""just friends"" and I always escalate now. I understand some may suggest to ""next"" however I realize this type of girl is good for me to keep in rotation because she was definitely a girl I always wanted to hook up with and even though its not always on my terms I'm just wondering if I call her out on it, or act aloof like I have been doing.

He's going to go through some uncomfortable times here for a while, and I want to make sure I can be there for my Dad and Mom while they deal with this.

I'm still a virgin, although I have been obsessing over Pickup and TRP for 4 years. In the last year I had more opportunities to close than ever, but I backed out of most of them, out of fear of disappointing them, but I think mostly to protect my ego of embarassment. I had one bad experience, when I took a girl from tinder home, after we accidentally ran into each other in a club. First night I was dominant and horny and drunk. She said ""I hope you are just as horny tomorrow"", because we had a date scheduled for the next day and allegedly she was on her period that day, so it stayed at heavy petting the first night. Next night with little sleep and hungover, we met up at a bar, took her home again, way to long foreplay(like heavy petting for an hour or sth.), since I was afraid of doing the deed and didn't know when to stick my dick in. Tried to go down on her, pussy smelled like tuna, which didn't really get me hornier. Finally lost my erection, when trying to put the condom on and had big anxiety. She even came back twice, either to prove sth to herself and/or because I'm very well endowed, but I always blocked her advances. I overthink and analyze stuff alot, probably more than many can imagine. So that first experience kind of marked me. I think I would be a good in bed after some practice, I'm very sensitive to how and what people feel and once I know what to do, I can see myself being very dominant. But for now I don't have any background and feel ashamed for that. I always feel like the girls would compare me to their former lovers and I would pale in comparison. They already experienced so much, have mostly 6-7 years of sexual activity in advance and I'm still a 21 years old virgin. I hate people seeing me weak. I especially hate the idea of her talking with her friends about her experience with me. And I can't go full alpha with a new girl, if I most likely won't be able to back it up. ( Along the lines of ""Wear no panties"" or describing what I'm gonna do to her) What would you advice me to do? Should I just go full beta and try to work through it with an understanding girl? Should I try to find some girls to just fail with and then dump them? I live in a rather small city, so the pool of sloots with no social strings attached is not too big. It's really eating me up inside, it's like one big part of adult life is till missing for me. I just want to experience it, to see that it's not as big of a deal as it is made out to be."

I ask this question because some people handle the harsh truths of the world better than others.

I don't know what was I hoping by writing these but whatever. I am what you would call a loser. I have no friends or people to hangout with. I usually feel a bit of sadness out of boredoom and being alone all the time. People can sense the negative energy I am radiating. I know this because occasionally I feel good and people like me more. This is like job search. When you have no experience, it is hard to find a job. When you can't find a job, you can't have experience. My vibe is bad because I'm alone. I'm alone because my vibe is bad. I don't know how to break the cycle. I was in this cycle pretty much my whole life. I can force myself to go to 20 meetups, and smiling, being positive until I make some friends. I can fake it till I make it but I can't find the energy and I end up staying in my shell. I guess I have some deeply rooted fears. I don't know. I can't be comfortable around people.

I have a diet and sometimes I screw up and waste the progress of a whole god damn week and I hate myself for it. SOmetimes I get tempted and eat or do bad activities. Maybe I'm addicted to misery or comfort. I think I don't want to get out because I'm afraid it means I fucking killed my life until now. I'm responsbile for the worst thing happened to me, which is I've been not really living. Never even hold hands with a girl. Never even fucking drink a beer and watch a movie with a friend. Never travelled with people I like. Never did anything exciting and reckless because I've been alone. I only went to a movie one time with a friend and I talk to him once a year. He is my best friend because I got no relly friends. He doesn't know anything real about me because if I tell him we would stop talking. I'm probably his 50th best friend. It is like formality. Well I accepted these and it doesn't really hurt. I'm too old to be bothered by it. I was saying I am like a rat in a box. I do whatever the fuck I want in my cage and scared to go outside.

My LTR now possesses a lot of these traits and it makes me desire her more than anything. I guess it is in an extended way a display of femininity, of smallness and triggers the protective instinct in me. But I can't help feeling somewhat paedophilic when I get unbelievably aroused by this sort of submissiveness, this outright stupidity and vulnerability. Even after sex, the sort of smallness associated with her. The curling up of her torso in a foetal position. Any display of this kind of innocence or endangerment drives me mad with desire.

Is she interesting?"" ect. With the correct intent of emotional vulnerability, a girl that is not in an unattracted state will not be seek reasons to reject you. Mapping the investment spectrum: &gt; A needy guy is invested in others. &gt; A confident guy is at the intersection of investment. &gt; A narcissistic guy is invested in himself. Here is the part that drives me crazy: Clearly the guy is the one who takes initiative; You find an attractive girl, you approach, you make your sexual interest known, and after all of that you should not need the girl's validation? Isn't that scenario the definition of investment and neediness? All men need the sexual agency of a woman. Even if there's many fish in the sea, you still need to get a fish. Even if you don't like the book ""Models"", not seeking female validation is a very common theme in game. It feels like there's a very fine line to thread.

Now, the problem is that I still remain an emotional and extremelly romantic guy. With women, for me, it's never only about sex... I like to feel the love i feel toward one particular girl, to make her feel special, since she's for me. I love to create a strong emotional connection, an attraction that goes beyond the merely physical impulses. Needless to say, this attitude has always brought me huge pain and a lot of suffering... now I know that's because I showed my vulnerability to women and it's never a good idea to do that. So the question is, based on the real women behavior and not the idealistic or romantic idea of them, how do I deal with my emotional and delicate inner side? Sometimes i feel like I have to pretend to be a person I'm not in order to attract women, and that sucks."

I had abusive parents and I grew up with very little self esteem. At first I was quiet and shy but eventually I began to overcompensate for this by becoming an arrogant asshole who only cares about himself, and hates everyone else. I don't want to be like this anymore. I get away with it because I'm tall and fairly handsome but I don't want to be this way. Deep down I believe I am a good person who has gone through a lot of pain and suffering. How much vulnerability do I actually show? Mentally I go from extreme neediness towards women (wanting then to cuddle and hold me) to complete contempt (wanting to fuck them and get rid of them). This is obviously unhealthy and I want to make a change. I have a lot of demons inside that I've never told anyone about. My childhood was very abusive and I don't know how much of this I should disclose to people. Being dishonest about my true nature doesn't work very well and I need to change. I need to present myself as what I am and be brave enough to be judged for it. I do quite well in other areas of life (sport, academics) but socialising is my Achilles heel. "

If you can manage to put a boundary between yourself and this women to protect yourself and what you have, the only downside is losing somethings you value. Even if you are going to lose her, you would still enjoy the process and journey. None of us will be here in 2100 but we still work hard to make our lives better. Nothing is permanant and everything sortof pointless because there is the end, but we keep going. Same logic applies. Why girlfriend-ing women is considered bad? Yes, it might be a delusion at some level and it might be counter intuitive (attachment leads to lower SMV thus less attraction over time), but it is still better than the alternative, which is fucking meats that are attached to big egos you are not connected to on human level. Personally I'd want it to be more than a mere sexual transaction. I'd want to fuck and be around a girl that I love. With that said, I'm ""assuming"" I wouldn't make myself vulnerable financially even if I'm in love. Even if that's the case, it is still a huge vulnerability.

I'm not at the stage of dating/meeting women yet so I mean any woman I encounter at work or socially. I can only respond from a place of apathy or amused mastery if that makes sense. It feels like I'm protecting myself before I allow any communication to take place so I'm never in a 'vulnerable' situation. It feels 'overly protected' and not real. When I do talk to girls in my social circle in a flirty context, it's either from a place of AM otherwise I mentally beat myself up if I ever slip up and say something slightly genuine or real that might have implications. How normal is this, if you can grasp what I'm trying to put across; I'm not sure if I grasp it myself. I'm not sure if I'm just too scared to try and talk to a woman in a genuine sense after being scared off of the idea. I've been on one date since TRP and I generally was a boring fuck because I didn't have anything to say. The 2 pre TRP dates I had I opened up a bit (in a care free lighthearted way) where I talked about my upbringing and other personal shit and it created a connection with the girl. I used to be very into self depreciating humour back then and it helped when used correctly and sparingly but I've mostly killed it since TRP instead having a faux confident and cocky demeanour. Something is off and I can't figure out what it is. Is it the lack of vulnerability. Are we supposed to completely kill any trace of it? I personally never used to be able to connect with someone until they exposed a vulnerable part of themselves. "

See, I was going through Monk Mode with positive results: I felt no more the need for masturbation (I did at last three times a week beforehand), I was gaining strength and confidence, I started seeing women for the actual value that they bring to my life, I let no one step on my toes, etc. And that was until last week where I finished reading Mark Manson's fucking *Attracting Women Through Honesty*. TL;DR, it's a recommended reading at the end of the RP Handbook that claims true attraction comes from the ability to show vulnerability and non-neediness. &gt;making yourself vulnerable doesnt just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, joining a table of people you dont know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. All of these things require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way. Youre making yourself vulnerable when you do them. In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. A man whos able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, I dont care what you think of me; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else. Hes saying hes not needy and that hes high status. Manson about women: &gt;Think about it. Why do women spend so much time and effort on their appearance? Why do they go to singles bars and join dating sites and give blind dates a try? They dont do it so that they can revel in rejecting a bunch of guys. Theyre just as lonely and frustrated as we are. They want to meet a man. But not just a man, a great man. A man who is confident, charming, fun and interesting. A man who isnt needy, who is vulnerable, and who will honestly express himself to her. She wants YOU to be that man. Shes secretly rooting for you. She doesnt want to reject you. Every time a new man walks up to her, shes secretly saying to herself, Please, please, please be the man. Be the attractive man that I cant say no to. And then he nervously stutters around buying her a drink and makes uncomfortable jokes about the weather and shes back to that horribly uncomfortable position of having to reject him again. The more I was reading Manson's book, the more I considered the RP Handbook and Rollo's *The Rational Male* to be more radical approaches, the more I felt my willpower to resist the traditional Blue Pill fantasies being shattered. I started telling myself that finally women are not that screwed up, that men who objectifying women are shitty ""fake alphas"" and that being a real alpha is about overcoming the fear of rejection from women/anyone (which still seems to me not 100% false). Ultimately, I feel as if *Attracting Women Through Honesty* reignited my desire to meet women/have fun/have sex, so my neediness. It's as if my mind, reminding me that I'm still overweight, that school (therefore opportunities with beautiful women) is coming and that my experience with women is limited, decided to put me once again in a state of feeling worthless. As a result, I had to once again fight urges not to workout, to eat like shit (which I succumbed sometimes) and to masturbate myself. So in conclusion, I woke up at 3:00am realizing that even though I resisted my urges to masturbate, MY WET DREAMS FUCKING CAME BACK. Since I took the habit of sleeping naked to reduce my dick's sensitivity (which worked amazingly until now), I just soiled my bed sheets like a shitty teenager. I'm super pissed and I feel like shit as well. Where have I gone wrong? Thanks for the support fellow RedPillers. "

As a result, I find it hard to be comfortable with putting myself out there with any women in why way, and this makes me default to asshole mode. It also makes it hard for me to be nurturing or supportive around them, because I always feel as if I can't expect them to support me in things I want to do.

She has demonstrated herself to be good LTR material, frequently pays for meals, very submissive in bed, confirmed (very) low n-count and good relationship with her father, typically follows my lead and engages in interests of mine with enjoyment. However, as the relationship has continued I've noticed a tapering-off of some of these characteristics. That can be expected in any LTR, and I have to accept responsibility for following a good Captain/First Mate dynamic; a dynamic she still accepts for the most part. Content: Within the last two months or so, she hasn't been putting quite as much effort into the relationship as she used to. Her and I are both very artistic by nature and one of the main facets of our relationship is expressing this. She presents me with a drawing or a poem, I make her a mixtape that has some personal significance etc. These expressions have become much less frequent. She has also been shit-testing me more and even copping a passive-aggressive attitude when I'm busy pursuing hobbies or playing music instead of hanging out with her. She is still almost always the one to text first or wish me a goodnight, but the texting has become a tad less frequent. More often she'll even get snippy and resistant when I issue a friendly/amused order of compliance. Text exchange for example: Her (after haircut): My hair is officially too short to braid. You're welcome to take a mournful moment of silence. (She knows I like braids and pulling on them during sex) Me: Really that short huh. Show me a picture. Her: Nah, see yourself this weekend. Maybe tomorrow night? While an exchange like this isn't a big deal to me at all, its been happening more and more often. She used to be more compliant and excited about sharing things like that with me. The sex is still frequent and amazing but her attitude is taking a gradual turn for the worse. Or if I take my time texting her back when she knows I'm practicing, she'll say something like ""Night. Have fun with your band."" which I know from experience she means passive-aggressively. In response, I've been making myself even more busy, improving my SMV by talking to other girls casually and dressing better, continuing to implement the 2/3 rule and even incorporating soft-dread by letting her see artwork other people have given me recently lying around. The effect hasn't been as profound as I was expecting. Summary: Interested in further advice to get her to invest more in me, re-establishment my power in the relationship. I am aware desire is non-negotiable, but I believe there are things I can do to continue to build more attraction in the relationship. I have no problem walking away if her attitude continues to head in a bad direction, but she still genuinely adds value to my life and is fun to fuck/be around. If it makes giving advice any easier, she seems to respond well to vulnerability. She is also going through a slight bout of depression (but this isn't out of the ordinary and doesn't phase me or affect my frame). Any advice greatly appreciated."

At my deepest core, it seems that I am a sexually submissive male and it's huge problem for me because it gets in the way of my ability to be Alpha. Since I was a child I remember fantasizing about women dominating and lowering me. I watched fem-dom porn to fulfill those fantasies. Submissive behavior is innately a BETA mind-set and it seems to be ingrained in me as it satisfies my ultimate pleasures/desires. I'm not sure how to break free. I've had sex with over 40 woman, do fairly fell with spinning plates, and as as tempting it may be I try to prevent myself from exposing these BETA fantasies. Unfortunately when I found a high enough caliber woman to enter an LTR with everything flipped on its head. I entered an LTR for two years. I've never connected with a woman on this level so I decided to be monogamous. I was the alpha and dominate figure in the relationship but I gradually opened my cards to her. She became my one-itis and I stopped spinning plates. One thing to consider is that I had partial control in being submissive because I willingly allowed it to happen but at the same time it takes a certain kind of woman (confident, powerful, dominating, manipulative, etc.) to tap that within me. We had a serious love for each-other and discussed building a life together/having kids. She moved with me across the country while I pursue my career. Somewhere along the way things got out of hand. I became addicted to her and how well she played into the dom role that I fantasized so much as a child. She fulfilled my desires like no one ever has and I reverted to becoming a dependent Beta. When I submit to those desires, I crave her 24/7 and would let her do anything she wants. I have thoughts of being monogamous while she uses me, spends my money and does whatever else she wants. I fantasize about her sucking another mans dick while I fuck her, and she perpetuates that fantasy by sucking on a dildo to tease me. She knows exactly how to rile me up and I eat it up. It drives me absolutely crazy and I instantly ejaculate uncontrollably. She ended up cheating on me (no surprise there). I crumbled, lost confidence went through much anguish. I separated from her to pick myself back up and regain my alpha-ness. I was successful to an extent however, I don't enjoy sex with other girls because I don't feel stimulated. Sex with my ex was stimulation overload so I go limp having casual sex with others. It is only when I imagine her instructing me to fuck these girls, that I start enjoying it. I am self-perpetuating this addiction. Thankfully I'm able to have a certain amount of control but It's a constant struggle to stay above it. When I give into the impulse, I go sniff her panties and uncontrollably masturbate all day. I could easily ejaculate 6-8 times in given day. It's a sickness and I feel ashamed writing about it. The arousal of being submissive comes from being a strong, physically fit Alpha male and being turned on by someone who's able to belittle me at their whim. I get so powerless and pathetic but I enjoy submitting more than anything I've ever felt in my life. I realize that if share this fantasy with someone, I expose myself to extreme vulnerability. I would compare this to a SERIOUS drug addiction. I have seen her since our breakup and fucking her makes me re-live this addiction. I'm able to hide it to an extent but she knows she has a Kryptonite effect on me. I realize that this woman is not special in any way. She was the first woman to fulfill my desires and it could have been any woman with similar personality traits. This is a internal problem I have that is affecting my ability to have a healthy sex life and relationship. For some context, my dad has been an alpha since I can remember. He's been spinning plates his whole life, managed a commanding presence with everyone in his circle, and all while being married to my mother for 30 years. My up-bringing has put the red pill in my face at a young age. Because of this, all the concepts in The Rational Male come very naturally to me. Being submissive is currently my biggest hurdle to becoming an Alpha. If there's anyone who has struggled with this, please share your wisdom. I feel like my situation is pretty unique and fucked up so I'm hoping there are brothers out there who have gone through what I'm dealing with. "

Reading Models has helped me understand that healthy relationships require that the man be slightly less invested than the woman, and that the goal of seduction is to get her more invested over time. Besides developing inner game, it seemed to me like one has to show some kind of investment first to invoke investment. However, now I think I'm making the mistake of showing too much interest to girls who (although interested) aren't emotionally invested in me yet. My rationale was that showing direct interest shows vulnerability, but now I feel like this is hurting my chances with potential plates rather than helping. If anyone can provide some insight: - How does one show the right amount of investment without coming across as being needy? - Does showing too much investment too early (or more investment than the girl) mean a failed attempt at plating/dating the girl and that I should move on? - Is it possible to reduce/reverse the amount of investment (statements of direct interest, initiating contact, etc.) that one has already shown?

In fact, he says that the combination of self-improvement improving physique and style combined with showing vulnerability (through honesty) and non-neediness is the best technique to strongly attract women to escalate with.

I'm feeling shit I haven't felt since I was a stupid teenager with my first ltr who I lost my virginity to. She's started to get significantly more invested in me too. I'm fairly sure she's more invested than me. But she is damaged goods. It is true what they say about single mothers being more aggressive to make up for the lack of man in the house. She shit tests when she should comfort test which just reduces her smv more, to which she shit tests again and has a general aggressive response to most conflict situations. It has taken some months for her to start actively behaving passively in the relationship. Basically what I'm saying is, for the first time since I started TRP, I'm anxiously invested in a woman I don't want to lose and she is invested in me. She is in no way a unicorn and absolutely has her faults and typical female shit flinging but I like her enough that I want it to work and would be noticeably shaken if it didn't. The situation becomes more complex because I noticed this change in my perception of her a little while back and decided to actively pursue other girls to try and break it (instead of just being open to fucking someone else and not going out of my way to achieve it). I ended up plating a new girl. It didn't help with my developing feelings for the original girl and now I'm strongly considering means of breaking it off so that it doesn't effect the relationship with her. My original girl (although we aren't in a relationship) is supposed to be exclusive with me and me with her. So I very much feel guilty and have found myself more to hiding this from her than agreeing and amplifying when she shit tests me about potentially seeing other girls. ------------------------------------------------------------------- I'll explain a little more on the exclusivity agreement here. I was and am still fairly sure she did some misbehaving of her own a little while back - (she had stressed the notion of us being exclusive but then suddenly insisted on us wearing condoms after coming back from a cruise. She claimed it was because she didn't know what I had been doing while she was away but after I probed a little she very vaguely implied that she had done something on the ship. I think it was something along the lines of 'I just met loads of people there' Me - 'What does that have to do with anything?' 'I was just meeting lots of people all the time' Me - 'If you slept with someone I'm not going to be jealous, I just don't want to wear condoms unless we have to 'I didn't sleep with anyone' So I didn't get the truth out of her, but I had decided by that stage that she was just a plate so it didn't matter and continued on with life. We also recently bumped into a guy in public that she seemed a little guilty to run into with me around and he greeted her with a very warm hand grab with the other hand rubbing her elbow. She later admitted to me that this was a guy she had been spending time with a weekend before I'd already been told about. He took her and her kids target shooting. It was at this point that she confessed he is an ex boyfriend she still spends time with.) So pretty much after the cruise incident, she had informally cancelled our being exclusive by both saying that if I had been fucking other girls, she and I were still on and by implying that she had been sexual outside of our relationship herself. ----------------------------------------------------------------- Recently however, some months later I have landed a new plate and my relationship with the original girl has become muuuch more invested. My original girl apparently didn't see the cruise incident as a withdrawal of our 'only fucking each other agreement' because she came to me the other night with a concerned look on her face and asked me if I had other girls on the go. I didn't outright lie to her but I certainly implied that I wanted to be exclusive with her. I apologise if this is long winded and all over the place but I'm really not in a good mental place right now hashing this all out. Basically, I'm finding myself more and more in a full blown relationship type situation I didn't consciously intend on being in and it frightens me because the more I like this girl the less in control of the situation I feel. I'm seeing another girl just for the sake of trying to maintain some abundance mentality but it seems totally wrong and that I'm not plate spinning, but cheating on a girl I'm really into. The girl I'm super into does a range of things that would grant her an upgrade normally, but also has a load of red flags as well. I'm just super confused and finding myself swinging one way and then another. I want to be with this girl exclusively now and she very strongly is pushing for an upgrade but I'm scared because I haven't had these feelings for someone for a long while and I'm not comfortable with the vulnerability that comes with being invested in a girl and the power it takes out of my hands in the potential to hurt me. I'm also unsure whether I should just try and friend my other girl as a backup for the future. "
140,vulnerability,asktrp,Only consider marrying a HB5 or below?,3,3yqivw,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/3yqivw/only_consider_marrying_a_hb5_or_below/,2015-12-30 14:09:02,"TL;DR - We have our eyes wide open to how messed up women are but we have some of our own issues, discuss. When I first started learning game I met up with a cool French guy who used to travel the world doing nothing but day game (he had enough money to travel and not work, but was not rich). He had been to most major cities and never approached less than 100 women per week. I saw him in action several times, he would get numbers about 80% of the time. We are both philosophically minded and we had a discussion one day about why we do it. We both agreed it would be nice to find a good girl and have someone who really loved you and cared about you, yet here we both were, sleeping with several women each per week and devoting so much time to our appearance and getting laid by vapid hotties. We both quickly agreed that the easiest way to have what we want is to be with a less hot, more nerdy sort of girl, who has a soul, a brain and wants a partner to take care of. A girl who is not naturally pretty but who has a good personality and would display loyalty. Yet we both agreed that our biological and sexual urges drive us to sleep around, and only with hot girls. It makes me think about our role in the whole fucked up mess we find ourselves in. We all see the issues associated with women, hypergamy, branch swinging, AFBB. We all agree that they are genetically hardwired to behave like this. I think we would all agree that as men we are hardwired to want to sleep with as many young, attractive women as we can. The harsh reality that both sexes find themselves born into is the inability to satisfy all of our urges. We exist in a paradigm which can never be reconciled. ""Never the twain shall meet"". Women would love a society where it is acceptable for her to get pounded weekly by Chad and have Chad's baby, while having a skinny nerd at home to provide the beta bucks, emotional validation and care for the children and household. Men would love a society where they have 2-8 plates, plenty of fresh girls, have children and a loving mother for those kids. To actually be loved exclusively by one woman and be emotionally and mentally satisfied with her. Essentially there is no way to have all that we want, and that is the same for women. We have all been lied to for a long time by an old world society which told us we could have a happy marriage, a loyal wife and children. Now these things are possible in a society which shames or punishes those who break the rules (muslim nations, old fashioned christian communities, tribal areas where there is severe punishment for adultery etc.). So without an artificial punitive system which rigorously enforces fidelity in marriage it is impossible to have a secure or happy marriage. What we have in the west today is a society which has been corrupted by toxic feminist logic to place female needs above male needs and the long term needs of children. We have a system which rewards a woman for cheating and punishes a man purely because he is a man. So taking all of this into consideration, as my friend and I realised, the only way to have a loving partner, children and some security in your future plans is to LTR a less attractive girl. Even if you are Chad Thundercock, if your girl is a HB7 or above, hypergamy will eventually bite you in the ass, she will divorce rape you and take your kids. If she is HB5 or below, her options for finding someone better than you are non-existent. She will be madly in love with you, faithful, she will cum every time you have sex, she will be a loving and devoted mother and she will care for you and stay with you in your rare moments of vulnerability or weakness. Your sacrifice in this is sex with someone stunning. LESSONS LEARNED/ SUMMARY: 1) Red pill logic is sound. If you want to pump plates for the rest of your life then follow it to the letter. 2) Marriage for a man in this society is like signing a power of attorney which allows for someone to rape you, break your heart and abduct your children. 3) Perhaps the only way to have a decent LTR and kids is to take a girl who is at least 4 points lower than you in SMV. Just like the old song says : If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life Never make a pretty woman your wife So for my personal point of view Get an ugly girl to marry you A pretty woman makes her husband look small And very often causes his downfall As soon as he married her and then she starts To do the things that will break his heart But if you make an ugly woman your wife A-you'll be happy for the rest of your life An ug-a-ly woman cooks meals on time And she'll always give you peace of mind Don't let your friends say you have no taste Go ahead and marry anyway Though her face is ugly, her eyes don't match Take it from me, she's a better catch [Spoken:] Say man! Hey baby! I saw your wife the other day! Yeah? Yeah, an' she's ug-leeee! Yeah, she's ugly, but she sure can cook, baby! Yeah, alright! Thoughts?"

I didn't turn into a helpless BP, but I leaned on a her a bit for support and she seriously did some wonderful things for me, and for the first time I can say I'd be devastated if she wasn't in my life. I view this as a positive, but obviously it increases my vulnerability and the possibility of beta qualities surfacing. It's at the point where if she is to stay in my life I will have to make some big commitments (moving for my career etc.). I want her to know she's important to me.

Several times, she has gotten mad to the point of leaving my house and not contacting me for a few days. She always comes back and apologizes. This scenario is playing out again, she just texted me that she wants to come over after work tomorrow. If it's anything like the last 4 times, I will open the door and we will hug for a bit.

I read Models seeing as it was one of the top 5 or even 3 books on TRP subs/sites/booklists. Now maybe I cataclysmically misread the book, but ""Vulnerability"" is *literally the one word* I would and do use to sum up the entire book. It hammers it into you, it's the critical base of power, the solution to the paradox of neediness, investedness (sacrifice/altering), and fake alphaness. Vulnerability is the theoretical base that everything in the book is based on and refers back to. This is like saying we advocate Jezebel.com except for the feminist stuff. Am I missing something here? What else in the book stands out as red pill compared to any other pua rag if you remove vulnerability? I thought that was the one thing that made Models popular in TRP. More importantly, how is Mark Manson's definition of Vulnerability not something /r/TRP agrees with? I mean he even quotes No More Mr Nice Guy, one of the other TRP bible's, in the exposition of the term. &gt;As Psychologist Robert Glover says: ""Humans are attracted to each others rough edges."" &gt; ...**a man who becomes comfortable with his vulnerability becomes the opposite of needy**. If neediness is prioritizing others perceptions about you over your own, then vulnerability is the exact opposite. Being vulnerable forces you to accept and prioritize your own perception over those of others. If you take this vulnerable stuff out there's like nothing novel in the book. "

On many occasions with different girls, I have had problems with getting/maintaining an erection during sex. With a girl I've currently been hooking up with, it's been 6 or 7 times now where we've tried, but I've only been able to get and maintain an erection during sex one of the times (and it was great sex) I'm almost positive this is an issue with my brain and not my dick. I always get hard from making out, cuddling, and foreplay but it's only right at the moment I'm about to put it in, that I go limp. Then after that no matter what I try to do I can't get it up until she starts blowing me again. It's been ending with her giving me a blowjob which i can always stay hard from but if she stops for a second and we try to fuck again, it goes down within a matter of seconds. I've learned about how porn / masturbation can lead to ED on r/nofap and r/pornfree. So I haven't watched porn in over two months and I've been masturbating much less. I also know that overthinking the fact that I'm about to lose it will only make me more likely to go limp too. Anyway I'm just looking for advice on how to maintain frame here while I psychologically deal with this issue. The girl has been really good about it. She has not once acted disappointed or tried to pressure me into getting hard enough to fuck her, but the last time it happened, she could tell I was frustrated, which shows weakness and vulnerability. So, what's a good way I can handle this while still seeming in control and in my own frame? And any tips from people who have had a similar problem with ED and overcome it would be great too.

Student at this point. I've made it as far as halfway through ""The Manipulated Man"" and I had a question. &gt; We have already mentioned woman's lack of emotional capacity. The fact that women make every attempt to suppress man's ability to express his emotions is a certain indication of this. Yet she still contrives to create the myth of feminine depth of feeling and vulnerability. &gt; This is obviously a mistaken interpretation. Women really are callous creatures - mainly because it is to their disadvantage to feel deeply. Feelings might seduce them into choosing a man who is of no use to them, i.e., a man whom they could not manipulate at will. They might even actively come to dislike men (after all, men are beings who should be alien to them) and decide to spend their lives exclusively in the company of women. In fact, however, there are far fewer overtly homosexual women than homosexual men, and such women are generally well-to-do or at least financially secure. &gt; A woman with feelings would have to think and work, to take on responsibilities, and to learn to do without all the things which mean so much to her. Because she does not want this, she decides to remain callous, but she knows, at the same time, that it is necessary for woman to enact the role of a sensitive being or man would become aware of her essentially cold, calculating nature. Still, as her emotions are always faked and never felt, she can keep a clear head. You can take advantage of someone's feelings only if you are not involved yourself. Therefore, she turns her partner's emotions to her own profit, only taking care to make sure he believes she feels as deeply as he himself, perhaps even more deeply She must make him believe she, `as a woman,' is much less stable, much more irrational, much more motional. Only thus may her deception remain undetected. But manipulation has, in any case, already taken care of that. These are excerpts from ""The Manipulated Man"". Are women more emotional creatures than men or are they emotionless? Here's what I've understood and experienced. Women can only think in the NOW. Women struggle thinking rationally. Women don't have a sense of empathy. So when they have to make a decision they are too incapable to think rationally and are to emotionless to think emotionally. So they just decide what makes sense in the now as a last resort? Also if women are more emotionless why do we always reference ""feeeelzz""? Can someone please explain this in a better way to me? I'm getting sort of confused. Maybe I'm just looking at it the wrong way."

Not women, humans. I mean, youve been behaving as a Nice Guy your entire life with little to nothing to show for it. That wasnt exactly a rational decision, was it? You consistently chose to get involved with manipulative women. Why? Thats not very rational either. &gt;Humans, both men and women, are slaves to their emotions and subconscious itches. Logic only comes into play when we want to justify what we already feel to ourselves and to others. Now, I don't think that he's trying to dismiss gender differences altogether here. I think he's trying to make it clear that you will find irrationality in both genders, and that's part of human nature. I found the same pattern in another book TRP recommends, ""How to win friends and influence people"" where Carnegie says: &gt;When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity. And while Carnegie himself wasn't attempting to give a dating advice but a social one (from a mostly ""salesman"" perspective) his advice still holds merit, even though he was dealing with men 99% of the time! Where I'm going with this is, that I think that we're all too caught up with defining ourselves as different than blue pillers (because we are, duh?) and women (because we also are, unless you're a woman who browses this board) but we're still susceptible to the same errors of thinking and weaknesses as every other human is.

This morning I send her a text - I apologize for being a bit childish and let her know the truth. My father, who I haven't spoken to in four years, decided to call me up and reiterate that he hates me, has disowned me, and so on. I don't go into it - just say ""I had a chip on my shoulder before I went out last night, wasn't expecting it to get under my skin like it did and this mixed with having to leave soon.""

I want to help my father. I know its kinda newcomers urge to help others with TRP view of life . I learned that force feeding is not the way so I stopped ""helping"" friends long time ago. I just listen to them and tell them my opinion , if they are willing to listen. I have it pretty clear with friends or other people but I am not entirely sure how to put it with family members. Basically situation is like this.(We live in Eastern Europe(Slovakia)): Father is ULTRA caring, indecisive, altruistic, good guy, helping-everyone-who-asks person. By TRP terms he is Beta(omega). I respect him for providing for me , my sister. I RESPECT HIM. Problem is, he totally don't respect himself and I am worried about his mental health. His main issues are that he is constantly mocking himself, trying help with too many tasks for other people so he becomes overwhelmed. Year ago he started to care for his parents on such extreme level, he literally phone his mother couple times a day. On top of that he is visiting them everyday on the way from work. If they don't pick the phone, he phone me to go check on them. Grandparents are essentially farmers , so they spend all day working on field or feeding animals. They chose it, so basically its hobby/way of life for them. Grandpa (the alpha) , last year, have to go for numerous hospital checkups+surgery, so there is no way, he will be able to maintain all his duties(hobbies), so he put my father to do things that are completely out of proportion for man, who have the regular 8 hour job (with 1.5 h commute). My father is completely alphaed by grandpa who don't give a fuck and father is not able to stand up and say ""no"". He thinks its his duty to help his parents with everything and on top of that is my mother , who can see vulnerability and attack him verbally everyday. Basically he won't pass any shittest she is firing at him. Don't get me wrong, I love both my parents, but mother is acting like from the text book. She got more respect in me, than in my dad , and that is fucking wrong. I'am trying to support father everytime there is a fight between parents, but I cant be there everytime, 'cos I am studying at university and visiting them like for 2 days once a month. So toxic enviroment. There are lot of small red flags about dad behaviour, that his self esteem is in negative values. * Asking lot of stupid questions all the time * Jumping in shock when I drop accidentally something on the floor * Not able to do fucking small decisions * Totally not socializing (Decline invitation for wedding last week and lot of other) * Taking every remark to calm down as personal assault * Mumbling while doing stuff * Discouraging others to do stuff * Overprotective and ULTRAcareful about everything that is totally not necessary.(I was goin' for a cardio as usual on usual road , when he started to equipping me with all kinds of light reflective accessory and to call him when I will be in halfway of my track to make sure I didn't fall or something.I was fucking WHAT?) * Going defensive and aggressive, when confronting him with his overCare with his parents. (Basically he thinks, every son should take care of his parents, no matter what and if you question it, you are devil person.) Today I have seen him on his lowest point so I actually take him out for walk. Mother was yelling at him about ussual grandparents topic, he just sat there taking all the heat. I interrupted moms agression and took dad out. We walk a mile, was pretty hard not to flood him with ""advices"" from his son. **tl;dr** How to help father stand up for himself and how to to help him realize,that he needs to be more alpha? Is there a way ? Thanks "

They sleep together and the next morning she is repulsed by him. I understand that she always saw the alpha in him due to his endless list of conquests and she needed to see some beta out of him in order to make her feel safe to sleep with him. He gave her that bit of vulnerability and without even saying a word after the deed is done, she pulls a 180 and is repulsed by him and says the friendship is ruined. What happened here?

It demonstrates a willingness to alter yourself for her to greater degrees than shes willing to alter herself for you. Remember, this is the definition of neediness and being unattractive."" Later in the book, he describes how he approached a women and the first thing he said was ""Hey, you're extremely beautiful so I just had to come and say hi"". 1) Wouldn't this be breaking his own rule? 2) For you personally, when do you think a women ""earned"" a compliment? 3) So this means I should only show vulnerability when she has earned it?

With this is mind, I decided to open up to a girl at work just as experiment. I explained to her how I had just realised that my aloof, quietly confident and laconic attitude makes me look just like an asshole in the eyes of people who don't know me very well. I didn't say it bothered me, I just described it as an observation I made and waited to see what her response to me would be. She actually agreed with me that it does me me look like an ass and then also that she knows me well and doesn't think I am actually an asshole. She then congratulated me on how I seem to be making an effort to be more outwardly friendly since I was actually having a real conversation with her and I told her that she was a exception to most other people in the office. And that was it... Now I'm not even sure what I go out of this experiment. I'm not trying to run game on the girl since I work with her and she has a boyfriend (something she seems to mention every time I talk to her - the boyfriend always come up). But, she's always in my face and so sometimes I'll just push and pull her and have fun with it. This is the only time I have opened up to a girl like this and honestly it felt like a waste of time. I'm still not sure what I learnt from it. Is that because it is actually a pointless exercise or was is just the way I did it?

I also try to have multiple plates, but there's always one that I view as gold while the others are just porcelain. Can't seem to help it. I come here 'researching' and seeking advice, and regularly can't understand what advice should be used at what time. For example, some people say ""next her and cut conact"" when giving another person advice from a non-responding girl, but should you do this after knowing her for 3 months, or give her more of a chance because you like her and have a connection? Was that advice only for a girl you've seen one or two times? Also, I've heard you're supposed to ease up ""running game"" after a certain point, and it's okay to tell her you like her, etc. Generally, at what point does that happen? So, anyone have advice on the steps involved and/or a general timeline of events that should (or are able to) take place? For example... **1-2 Weeks** Sex Hang out 1-2 times a week Do fun and exciting things If no response from her, wait 2 days and try again, if not next her **2-6 Weeks** It's okay to show some vulnerability (I've heard some contradicting thoughts on this) It's okay for her to meet some of your friends and you theirs Okay to go on a weekend away **6-8 Weeks** It's okay to tell them you like them (if they do it first?)

Several months ago I ended things with this one girl simply because I was bored. She was amazing though, attractive, smart, funny, laid back and did everything, and anything I wanted. Doesn't that sound perfect, or the ideal positioning for someone who is red pill? Well... Long story short - the redpill definitely worked, but almost too well. I literally had this girl in the palm of my hand. She would do ANYTHING for me, and I never gave her the upper hand. She would shit test over and over and I would either blow it up or simply ignore it entirely, held frame etc... Sex was good too, she was a smart and caring individual. But.. there was no spark. I controlled her entirely. It became boring. Sex later became a chore because in my eyes, she held no value because this overwhelming control over her. I felt like controlling her made me ""win"" and now that I deserved something more, better. I ended things with her, and consequently she was destroyed. She took it really tough. Now I'm dating a younger, attractive &amp; popular girl. She's more difficult to control. I do get my way and hold frame, but everytime she challenges it. this makes sex so much more satisfying. It's never boring. I know with this one, having full alpha status is going to be tough, but I like being a man man's and she likes that too. Many betas follow her and worship her and that's why I believe she's attracted to me, because I don't give her that type of attention. Since she's always challenging me and I hold frame, sex is absolutely amazing and very rewarding. On the flip side, since I have not fully established my dominance as the alpha, beta feelings creep up from time to time. For example: I get excited to see her, I check my phone frequently to see if she texts me (I don't do the beta thing and always text her, don't worry - I'm not that bad lol). I normally don't like to text often, but her and I rarely text and it's almost like I would like to text more... Since I 'care' I am subject to emotional vulnerability. I never got like that with the other girl because I knew, in her eyes, I am her entire world which I lost all desire for her. My dilemma: If I become alpha with the girl and she's the full blown beta - I get bored. If I have not established my alpha and have some beta emotion, I'm ridiculously attracted to the girl. I feel like I'm in a lose lose situation. Lose because I don't want to get bored and waste my time with someone I don't want to spend time with and I lose with a girl where I'm emotionally more invested in, because I'm setting myself up to being hurt and all those mindgames. I wanted to know what redpill subscribers think of this. I would like people who actually can speak from experience, compared to just theory please."

She's 33, I'm 27. Her: super fit, can hold an intelligent conversation, surfs (been in the sun and it shows) and a bit world-weary (she too is an expat in Asia- she's seen some shit) So we get into this conversation out in the water. She's cute enough but edging pretty close to wall there. 5 years ago I would have fallen all over this chick. Anyways I'm strangely attracted to her and thinking I'll show her a good time before her face collides with the wall but then our conversation turns to dating in Asia and she lets these three bombs drop: 1.) she doesn't usually date expats in Asia because she says most go to prostitutes (she's right on there) and she says that a guy who goes/has gone to prostitutes is ""likely unable to give her what she wants in a relationship"" and that she susses guys out before she'll date them- asks them point blank if they've gone and looks them in the eye to see if they're lying. 2.) she says she hasn't slept with too many guys and doesn't like to sleep with guys when she's unsure of their feelings towards her- says she did it once and it hurt like hell (later ended up dating the guy long term). She grew up super religious and conservative, apparently, but I'm not sure if this is cock carousel denier BS 3.) Says she doesn't want to get involved with anyone who's not interested in having kids soonish ""Duh, I'm 33, I gotta get on this shit before my eggies dry up."" (she actually SAID that out loud to me on a first meeting!) It was a refreshing conversation. Do you ever get that feeling like, ""I could totally tell this chick about red pill and she'd get it."" (I mean, I won't, but I feel like I could) Super smart and sarcastic but also has that little tinge of vulnerability that drives me nuts in a girl. Anyways saying all that it makes it clear that she doesn't see me as someone she's going to fuck- she seems smarter than to let that drop if she had any designs on me. For some reason her discounting me makes me want her more. Like she knows I have higher SMV than she does and she's bowing out gracefully before the games begin. I DO think she's attracted to me. All of the signs were there and there was all of that electric energy build up between us. I got her on Facebook and trying to figure out where to go. Knowing what I know from the above points 1-3, how ethical is it for me to bang this chick? Or try to, she might just evade me. (Edited to break up the text a bit)"

Background: I'm in my early thirties, super high SMV. Former male stripper turned Cybersecurity specialist, I have tons of brains and brawn. Been lifting for eons and I consider my level of fitness ""elite"". My job pays amazingly well and it's very secure. I've had an abundance mindset for many years, and I always spun a minimum of two plates at all times up until two years ago, when one of my plates was promoted to LTR. My LTR: As my tastes refined over the years of spinning plates, I eventually grew to know exactly what kind of woman I was ultimately looking for. She's not exactly high tier SMV to everyone, but she is high tier SMV to me. She looks the way I want a girl to look. She's chubby, bisexual, has long blonde hair, and tattoos. She's \~10 years younger than me, which is a problem, since I'm often having to help her with routine life issues. Our history: Two years ago, while I was spinning my current LTR, I was also spinning three other women at the same time. Eventually, thanks to social media, my plates became wise to each others existence. After the dust had settled, I opted to promote one girl to LTR and dump the rest. This would be my first try at monogamy in eleven years. She forgave me for all of the lying I had done about having other plates, which was a big deal to me. In a moment of weakness, I allowed her to move in with me, as she had just gotten a job in my town. (She made several moves indicating that she wanted to be closer to me, including breaking an apartment lease to move closer to me and applying for jobs in the town I lived in, even before we were ever officially together.) We lived together, and it wasn't bad. I missed having other women, but overall it was okay. We ended up having several threeways with a hot older woman, which I still consider to be the peak of my sexual experiences, until she eventually started feeling uncomfortable and we stopped. During this period of time, I cheated on her with an ex. I don't know why I did it, I feel like I'm a sexual deviant, but it happened several times before I stopped. Once I stopped doing that, aforementioned ex decided to sabotage my relationship with LTR because she knew I was still with her and decided that she wanted to hurt me. The results were devastating to the trust she had in me, and even now, almost a year later, I'm still feeling the consequences. Things were not the same after that. She start snooping in my phone, my computer, my closet. She is constantly distrusting of me, and what makes it worse is that no matter how innocent I feel like I am, I always seem to get caught engaging in some behavior that can be considered emotional cheating. I even got caught talking to the ex again. The Problem: I can only blame myself for the situation I am in. My LTR is having problems coping with what happened, and as a result has these terrible mood swings. She's super nice and sweet one minute, then nasty and hostile the next. I feel bad because my past behavior is causing hers, so I can't write it off as her fault. I'm happy when things are good between us, but every day is a coin flip. The question: Do I attempt to weather the storm and slowly repair the relationship, or bail? I'm very heavily invested in this relationship, and she has been very forgiving and likewise extremely invested as well, but the question is at what point do you surrender?"

I am currently 27 years old, and have been Red Pill Aware for about five years now.

I grew up in a family of police officers and entrepreneurs and ever since college (graduated with a bachelors when I was 22) Ive been dedicated to becoming a cop. I am currently in NJ and have been a cop for the past two years and absolutely love my job. I love the adrenaline, decent pay, ability to help others and face life/death situations. My current goals in the department were to hopefully join our Swat Team and become a Sergeant and eventually Lieutenant. No other job where I get paid to train in combatives, weapons, and be a leader of testosterone-fueled men. Herein lies the issue. Money. Ive been quite ambitious and hardworking throughout my life and feel like I set the bar short by becoming a cop. No matter how many lives I potentially save or bad guys I apprehend my pay scale is set. Ive been feeling regret and some stress due to this. As far as pay, my top salary will reach mid 120k, Sgts (170k) and Lt. (190k) and thats without OT or off-duty jobs around $95.00 an hour. In my mind it will lead a comfortable life (especially with a retirement at approximately 50 years old making 60% of top pay) but Ill never become a millionaire or be truly successful. Im asking those whove done career changes late in life, found lucrative salaries and what other options I may have. Id hate to give the job I love just for money, but need to sit down and figure things out before time passes me by. I have given thought to joining the military as a reservist to help potentially pay for a Masters in some lucrative field such as (computer science, Cybersecurity or an MBA.) Ive done my research as far as investment strategies such as stocks, index funds, real estate, and other government retirement plans. I realize I may be overthinking things but Id feel lot more comfortable grabbing the wisdom and insight on fellow red pill men. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I can provide more info if needed. I know there will be comments with cop haters and people claiming Im just a lackey for government, but my intention going in was to help others and catch the real bad guys. So far in my career Ive fought and apprehended a murderer, provided CPR to a lifeless infant, and patched someone up after he was stabbed repeatedly. Also have dropped red pill wisdom on gentlemen who were in destructive marriages. My rants to show some guys actually do this job just to do the right thing and its ""cool."""

I know that my situation is not bad at all and lots of people would want to swap places. Yet, I do not feel fulfilled because I kind of lost track of why I went for Computer Science. I find it very interesting but during this work experience I am just not feeling the software developer life. I find myself among seasoned engineers who are incredibly good at what they do. They talk on topics of technology and I feel out of place because I feel completely inadequate. I do not have internal curiosity and passion to learn more and people can definitely feel that I am not a passionate technologist. I equate myself to one of those people my professor mentioned who are just not suited to become great software engineers. The issue is that I am completely disinterested to other IT career paths. Programming is actually most interesting to me from all others(cybersecurity, networking, testing etc.) and I am just not that good at it. I had other interests in school: life sciences and medical research but wanted to try out IT. Reason: interesting, 4 years at school instead of around 10 for med school or medical research scientist. I was afraid of investing so much time and realizing that it might not be for me. I also watched this video excerpt recently: URL and it got me thinking that this is the path in the future where I am not doing work I can be good at naturally and hence, help the world the most. I read posts on main sub on career and pursuing money is wise in the long term but it seems very shortsighted because software is meritocracy and people are rewarded for their technology skills. Pay for mediocre engineers is quite poor, especially in Europe, and I will never get to excellence stage if I don't live and breathe the subject. I see so many people, including my relatives, who drag their ass to work to collect huge paycheck. They become good at work over time but the time flies by: that is what happens when every day is the same. And then you find yourself 40 years old with regrets of not risking it while younger. I'd risk it. I'd finish university because quiting at last year is stupid but go for whatever it seems to move my heart. I was also diagnosed with mild depression by a doctor that I think stems from being not satisfied with where I am right now. My question is: how do people find what they are good at? I don't think that not being passionate about something is good for you in the long run or am I naive youngster and complain about things a lot people would love to swap places with?"

I practiced refusing to be nice/cowtow to bitches, and there was even an incident where a 7.5 was walking out right past me and wanted me to move. I just held out my hand as if to say ""if you can't hit this gap in a straight line beteen myself and the door, you probably won't make it home alive""... she ended up walking away for a second, coming back and grinding on me while leaving and slipping her number in my pocket. So stage 1 was successful and reaffirming. Then, however, when I went outside with some friends to smoke, Mizz Cunter Dyke Menstral-Related managed to cause me to slightly break frame. I asked her fat, bearded beta friend for a lighter, and he said he just gave it to the brunette on the wall hanging with her [pussified beta BF0. I walked up and said, ""hi, can I please use your friends lighter?"" She claimed she had no lighter, her cig spontaneously combusted and that I wasn't worth loaning that shit to anyways. I called her a cunt, told her boyfriend that 2 years before I had been robbed and stabbed 8 times while downtown and had been rigorously learning Krav Maga ever since (all true) so whatever shit he might try I would make sure it would hurt him to move his cartoid neck artery for the next 50 to 60 years. He backed off like a puppy that sees the newspaper coming for it's head after shitting on the carpet. What this girl never knew, of course, is that my literal job title is ""Cybersecurity Counterintelligence Specialist"", and my life is all about finding shit out about possible corporate spies, disgruntled employees, Black Hats, even if they never wish to encounter me again. So, today I found a pic of Beardo on instagram, used an AES256 decryptor to find it's true, public name (took about 90 non-observed minutes) and explained he could rat on the cunt or I would make his Macbook into a merry go round of Debian, Tails and ArkOS and OSX would be gone, and yes, the NSA would notice. I now have her phone number, name, adress and email/facebook/pinterest/school ID #. I know I seem angry; being sexually assaulted at 7 years of age and then having a 2 year oxycontin and sex addiction recently have not helped matters, and I am seeing a therapist. However, Mizz Cunt should learn strangers can be more than they seem. or no? i forgot to mention that when she flicked her cig butt and I used a pocket knife to pick it up and light my own cig, she said ""ha bet you don't know what the fuck you would ever do with that in a fight"" or some shit. This hurt cuz oof when I got stabbed, but also because every Saturday in Krav Maga we study defensive handgun techniques and offensive knife techniques. I could have slit her fucking carOTid artery right then and killed her, but I'm not a psychopath"
