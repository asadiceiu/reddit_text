Our would-be clients dont always know the best solution for their needs or may require more insight to make a final decision. Thats where you step in. You have a breadth of technical knowledge and the ability to discuss technical concepts at any level. You can explain and discuss complex ideas with executives, lawyers, and experienced security engineers. If need be, you could even chat about cybersecurity concepts with a shopping mall Santa. Your communications skills and broad technical perspective will be crucial as you work with clients to define the scope of their project. Day in and day out, youll be gathering information, identifying risks, and creating a plan for their security testing. Youll spend much of your day researching; learning the clients business, understanding their technology, and the security concerns that relate to it. Heres where your ability to review software and understand IT architecture, APIs, network protocols and other attackable interfaces will come into play. You might look at a zero-trust network, a bleeding edge web application, an IoT device, and a legacy SOAP service on an AS/400 all in the course of a day. In short, youll work with Bishop Fox consulting services and our clients to answer the questions of why perform a penetration test and how to successfully accomplish it. You have an eye for the bigger picture; you see the details as well as how they add up. You will be an architect for the experience our new clients have with our organization (the largest offensive security firm in the world). What you do will reverberate throughout the rest of the engagement  and clients relationships with Bishop Fox from then on out. **Your Education and Experience** * 2-5 years of IT, system administration, and/or software development experience as well as client-facing and/or customer service experience * A broad understanding of IT infrastructure, Amazon Web Services and other cloud platforms, Linux, and modern web application/API architecture preferred * Knowledge of embedded device software, firmware, and hardware design from a security perspective is highly desirable but not required. * Ability to understand business needs and forces that drive technical and security decisions * An innate desire to understand and communicate our clients needs to ensure we provide useful insight * The ability to travel 10-20% is preferred, primarily to major cities in the U.S. for client visits as well as Bishop Fox offices (New York City, San Francisco, and Atlanta) once it is safe to do so * Uncanny attention to detail * Research skills that a grad student would envy * A strong sense of urgency  you dont let things slip * Awareness of the latest technology trends * Experience working in a consulting structure is a bonus Candidates across the United States are welcome to apply.
