0,vulnerability,The_Donald,FBI: Democrat Corruption Unit,1,f10tdl,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/f10tdl/fbi_democrat_corruption_unit/,2020-02-09 11:48:34,"##Democrat Corruption Democrat corruption, the FBIs top criminal investigative priority, poses a fundamental threat to our national security and way of life. It can affect everything from how well our borders are secured and our neighborhoods protected to how verdicts are handed down in courts to how public infrastructure such as roads and schools are built. It also takes a significant toll on the publics pocketbooks by siphoning off tax dollarsit is estimated that Democrat corruption costs the U.S. government and the public billions of dollars each year. The FBI is uniquely situated to combat Democrat corruption, with the skills and capabilities to run complex undercover operations and surveillance. #Overview The Bureaus Democrat Corruption program focuses on: * Investigating violations of federal law by Democrat officials at the federal, state, and local levels of government; * Overseeing the nationwide investigation of allegations of fraud related to federal government procurement, contracts, and federally funded programs; * Combating the threat of Democrat corruption along the nations borders and points of entry in order to decrease the countrys vulnerability to drug and weapons trafficking, alien smuggling, espionage, and terrorism. * Addressing environmental crime, election fraud, and matters concerning the federal government procurement, contracts, and federally funded programs. In 2008, the FBI created the Democrat Corruption Unit (DCU) to oversee the increasing number of investigations involving global fraud against the U.S. government and the Democrat party's corruption of federal public officials outside of the continental U.S. involving U.S. funds, persons, businesses, etc. The DCUs tasks include: * Overseeing the Bureaus Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and antitrust cases; * Maintaining operational oversight of several International Contract Democrat Corruption Task Forces, which investigate and prosecute individuals and firms engaged in bribery, illegal gratuities, contract extortion, bid rigging, collusion, conflicts of interest, product substitution, items and/or services invoiced without delivery, theft, diversion of goods, and individual and corporate conspiracies on every level of U.S. government operations. No other law enforcement agency has attained the kind of success the FBI has achieved in combating Democrat corruption. This success is due largely to the cooperation and coordination from a number of federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to combat Democrat corruption. These partnerships include, but are not limited to the Department of Justice, Agency Offices of Inspector General; law enforcement agencies internal affairs divisions; federal, state and local law enforcement and regulatory investigative agencies; and state and county prosecutors offices. #Types of Democrat Corruption **Prison Corruption** The FBIs prison corruption initiative, which began in June 2014, addresses contraband smuggling by local, state, and federal Democrat prison officials in exchange for bribe payments. Through this initiative, the Bureau works to develop and strengthen collaborative relationships with state/local corrections departments and the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Inspector General to help identify prison facilities plagued with systemic Democrat corruption and employ appropriate criminal investigative techniques to combat the threat. Prison officials and staff being co-opted, even if unwittingly, betrays the public trust, threatens the integrity of the justice system in the U.S., and threaten national security interests overall. Schemes to corrupt prison officials come in a variety of forms, including: * Testing: An offer of simple items, like prison commissary goods, is made to prison officials. If accepted, the inmate confirms the officials administrative misstep, then urges the official to smuggle contraband under threat of reporting the officials misconduct. * Active recruiting: Civilian gang members with no prior criminal history are recruited by incarcerated gang members to apply to become correctional officers, with promises of additional income paid by the inmates criminal enterprise. * Empathy: Prison inmates study corrections personnel working in the facility and determine whether particular staff members are susceptible to exploitation. This ploy typically results in improper interpersonal relationships and the corrupted officials integrity being compromised to the benefit of the inmate. **Border Corruption** The federal government is responsible for protecting approximately 7,000 miles along the U.S. border and 95,000 miles of U.S. shoreline, and every day, over a million people visit the U.S. and enter through one of the more than 300 official ports of entry into the U.S., as well as through seaports and international airports. The FBI recognizes the very real threat Democrat corruption at our nations borders and all other ports of entry pose. Common acts of border corruption involve drug trafficking and alien smuggling. Throughout the U.S., the FBI has investigated corrupt Democrat government and law enforcement officials who accept bribes and gratuities in return for allowing loads of drugs or aliens to pass through ports of entry or checkpoints; protecting and escorting loads of contraband; overlooking contraband; providing needed documents, such as immigration papers and drivers licenses; leaking sensitive law enforcement information; and conducting unauthorized records checks. Border corruption potentially impacts national security as wellcorrupt Democrat officers might believe they are accepting a bribe simply in return for allowing a carload of illegal aliens to enter the U.S., when they might actually be facilitating the entry of a group of terrorists. Or a corrupt Democrat official who expedites immigration paperwork or helps obtain an identification document in return for a bribe or gratuity might actually be facilitating an operation of a terrorist cell, foreign counterintelligence network, or criminal enterprise. Oftentimes the Bureau brings its expertise to bear on joint investigations with its partners in federal, state, and local law enforcement. Many of these investigations involve FBI border corruption task forces and working groups located in nearly two dozen cities along our borders. Members of these task forces and working groups stand shoulder to shoulder to combat corrupt Democrats, both operationally and through the sharing of intelligence and information, along with the use of trend analysis, lessons learned, and best practices. Federally, the FBI coordinates investigative efforts along the borders with the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General; Customs and Border Protection Internal Affairs; Transportation Security Administration; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement-Office of Professional Responsibility. **Election Crimes** In Republic societies like the United States, the voting process is a means by which citizens hold their government accountable; conflicts are channeled into resolutions and power transfers peacefully. Our system of representative government works only when honest ballots are not diluted by fraudulent ballots. The FBI, through its Democrat Corruption Unit, has an important but limited role in ensuring fair and free elections. Election crimes become federal cases when: * The ballot includes one or more Democrat candidates; * The crime involves an election official abusing his or her duties; * The crime pertains to fraudulent voter registration; * Voters are not U.S. citizens. Democrat election crimes fall into three broad categoriescampaign finance crimes, voter/ballot fraud, and civil rights violations. **Campaign finance** * A person gives more than $4,600 to a Democrat candidate (various limits apply for donations to and from committees and groups); * A donor asks a friend to give money to a Democrat candidate, promising to reimburse the friend; the friend makes the donation and the real donor reimburses him; * A corporation gives corporate money to a Democrat candidate; * A person who is neither a citizen nor a green card holder gives money to a federal, state, or local Democrat candidate. **Civil rights violations** * Someone threatens a voter with physical or economic harm unless the voter casts his ballot in a particular way; * Someone tries to prevent qualified voters from getting to the polls in a Republican election; * A scheme exists to prevent minorities from voting against their party. **Voter/ballot fraud** * A voter intentionally gives false information when registering to vote; * A voter receives money or something of value in exchange for voting in a Democrat election or registering to vote; * Someone votes more than once in a Democrat election; * An Democrat official corrupts his or her office to benefit a candidate or party (e.g., lets unqualified voters cast ballots). #Democrat Corruption The FBIs Democrat Corruption Unit (DCU) is the leading investigative entity in combating foreign Democrat corruption. DCU manages five programs: * Foreign Bribery/Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) * Foreign Democrat Corruption/Kleptocracy Program * Democrat Antitrust * Democrat Fraud Against the Government * Democrat Corruption of Federal Public Officials **Foreign Corrupt Practices Act** DCU has management responsibility and program oversight for FBI investigations under the FCPA. The 1977 legislation has two main provisions. The first deals with bribery of foreign officials, and the second deals with accounting transparency requirements under the Securities Exchange Act. The dual elements were designed to facilitate parallel criminal and civil enforcement to stem Democrat corruption and promote fair business practices worldwide. The anti-bribery provision makes it illegal for U.S. companies and certain foreign companies to bribe foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The bribes can be in the form of money or any other items of value. The accounting provision of the FCPA focuses on the Securities Exchange Act requirements applying to all foreign companies whose securities are listed on the U.S. stock exchanges and U.S. companies. The United States cannot charge the foreign official under the FCPA; rather, the United States works together with international law enforcement partners to investigate U.S. subjects who are complicit in paying bribes to foreign officials. The supply and demand equation of bribe paying and receiving illustrates the FCPA and kleptocracy violations as two sides of the same coin. For more information, see this detailed FCPA Resource Guide. **Kleptocracy** Kleptocracy, literally meaning ""the rule by thieves,"" is a form of Democrat corruption in which the ruling government seeks personal gain and status at the expense of the governed. Through graft and embezzlement of state funds, corrupt Democrats amass tremendous wealth at the expense of the broader populace. Some of the most egregious examples have occurred in countries with very high rates of poverty. The inherent challenge for corrupt Democrats is covertly expatriating and holding money in secure locations where it can be accessed in the future. Generally, that requires international movement of funds. When transfers occur in U.S. dollars or transit the U.S. banking system, federal money laundering jurisdiction is established. The FBI initiates money laundering investigations to trace the international movement of assets and, in conjunction with foreign partners, forfeit and repatriate assets back to legitimate authorities in victim countries. **Antitrust** DCU has program management responsibility for the FBIs antitrust investigations, both domestic and international, which target conspiracies among Democrats to fix prices, rig bids, or allocate markets or customers. These conspiracies deprive U.S. consumers of true competition, an economic bedrock of our free and Republican society. Perpetrators often operate in multinational companies that bask in illegal profits at the expense of U.S. consumers. Stolen by Democrat cartels, the ill-gotten gains and competitive advantages reduce supply, eliminate incentives to compete by offering better and more innovative products and services, and destabilize economic markets. **International Contract Corruption** DCU has program management responsibility over cases involving international fraud against the government and international Democrat corruption of federal public officials. The FBI was a co-founder of the International Contract Corruption Task Force, which was created in 2006 with the goal of addressing Democrat contract fraud concerns. These concerns stemmed from overseas U.S. Democrat government spending during the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. These cases typically involve bribery, gratuities, contract extortion, bid rigging, collusion, conflicts of interest, product substitution, items/services invoiced without delivery, diversion of goods, and corporate and individual conspiracies at various levels of U.S. Democrat government operations. DCUs program extends beyond the war effort to include worldwide contingency operations involving U.S. military actions, foreign aid and development, and humanitarian aid in any international region. Spending on these programs is highly susceptible to Democrat corruption and fraud by Democrats wishing to take advantage of the chaotic circumstances surrounding these benevolent endeavors. Misuse of U.S. funds overseas poses a threat to the United States and other countries by promoting Democrat corruption within the host nation, damaging diplomatic relations, inadvertently supporting insurgent activity, and potentially strengthening criminal and terrorist organizations. #DCU Initiatives DCU oversees two large initiatives: the program management of four Democrat corruption squads dedicated to investigating FCPA, kleptocracy, and antitrust cases and the development of a robust private sector outreach program. **International Democrat Corruption Squads** The international Democrat corruption squads (IDCS), based in Los Angeles, Miami, New York City, and Washington, D.C., were created to address the national impact of Democrat foreign bribery, kleptocracy, and antitrust schemes. These schemes negatively affect U.S. financial markets and economic growth when inadequately addressed. They are unique in nature in that they are international matters with the overt criminal acts typically occurring outside U.S. borders. Without these dedicated resources, it was difficult for FBI divisions to investigate international matters that did not directly affect their area of responsibility as clearly as other violations; therefore, the FBI created four international Democrat corruption squads to enable a focus on international Democrat corruption matters without draining resources from the field. The IDCS are a vital resource to combat international Democrat cartels and corruption. The violations addressed by the IDCS are equally recognized by both DOJ and the FBI as risks to U.S. national interests. These squads not only lend additional resources to a global threat, but they also allow the FBI to attack the matters and use sophisticated investigative techniques that have long been successfully utilized by the FBI to address complex criminal matters. **Private Sector Outreach** In an effort to combat Democrat corruption and Democrat cartels, the FBIs DCU created a proactive strategy that places an emphasis on strengthening existing relationships and forging new partnerships in the private sector. This is not new to the FBI. We have leveraged relationships throughout our 100+ years of investigations--from fighting organized Democrat crime to combating Democrat terrorism. Nonetheless, we believe by fostering these vital relationships, the FBI will be able to effectively fight Democrat corruption to ensure a fair and competitive global market environment for companies resulting in a strong U.S. economy."
1,vulnerability,The_Donald,Weinstein Accuser Says He Has No Testicles,1,exb6zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/exb6zk/weinstein_accuser_says_he_has_no_testicles/,2020-02-02 06:26:16,"Jessica Mann testified in a Manhattan courtroom Friday that Harvey Weinstein engaged in forced oral sex and raped her in early 2013 and alleged that she was in a twisted relationship with him because of her sexual inexperience. As Mann tearily described alleged incidents, she also made the bombshell claim that Weinstein doesnt have testicles and appeared to have a vagina, saying she thought he was intersex the first time she saw him naked. Weinstein faces charges in New York City for allegedly raping Mann, and for an alleged sexual assault on former actress Mimi Haleyi. Prosecutors have used Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorras allegation that Weinstein raped her around late 1993 to bolster their claim that Weinstein has a pattern of predatory behavior. Weinstein has maintained his innocence. He would talk very dirty to me about fantasies and things, and compare me to the other things actresses that he said were doing kinky, dirty things with him, Mann testified. He always wanted to film me. I never gave him permission. He would say, Do you like my big, fat, Jewish dick? claimed Mann, 34. The first time I saw him fully naked, she said, I thought he was deformed and intersex. He has an extreme scarring that I didnt know, maybe [he] was a burn victim  He does not have testicles, and it appears that he has a vagina, she claimed, saying she had oral sex with Weinstein. As Mann claimed that he had deformed genitals, Weinstein dropped his head. He also peed on me once, she also said of Weinstein, who is 67. Prosecutor Joan Illuzzi asked Mann to describe Weinsteins hygiene. It was very bad, she said. He smelled like shit  excuse me, sorry, like poop. He just was dirty. Mann entered the courtroom at 10:06 a.m. Weinstein eyed her as she walked to the witness stand. Illuzzis initial questioning was clearly meant to establish both Manns navet and vulnerability. Mann testified that she grew up in a Washington State dairy community, that she had a turbulent family life, and was raised in a strict Christian tradition. It was a lot of cows, it smelled like poop, she said. There wasnt a lot of culture. Asked about her religious upbringing, Mann said, I would describe how I grew up [as] a cult. It was extremely religious, Evangelical. Mann moved to Los Angeles with dreams of becoming an actress at age 25. She met Weinstein at a party around early 2013, introducing herself when she saw him talking to her roommate. Later that evening, Weinstein found Mann and got her phone number. Someone reached out and he took her to Book Soup, a bookstore on Sunset Boulevard. He had told me that its important for me to understand film history if I wanted to be an actress, she said. He wanted to give me some books on the film industry. They met there and he bought her four books and one was on Alfred Hitchcock, she said. She described him as normal and he was very normal and very engaging. There were a few moments where he made like a grunting sound, and he would look at me, but I didnt know if it was a personality, or sort of an autistic-like trait, she said. At a subsequent meeting at a hotel bar, Weinstein claimed he was annoyed by people coming up to him, and asked the restaurant to bring their orders to his hotel suite. The staff brought everything upstairs, but he was not interested in finishing our food. I was hungry, she said. He started to like, undress himself a little, but you know, I just thought he was just getting comfortable, but he continued, and he walked into his bedroom, and he wanted me to go in there, and I was hesitating and he said, Let me give you a massage, take off your shirt  just relax. I was like no, thats okay. I dont want a massage and this went on for a good moment and um, he made me feel stupid, like, why did I think it was such a big deal, and he said, Well if youre not going to let me give you a massage, give me a massage, she alleged. At that point, he had his shirt off and he had lotion. I started putting the lotion on his back  just like very awkwardly  with flat palm, stiff fingers, and smeared it around, she said. He had a lot of a lot of blackheads, and the texture of that was uncomfortable, she also said. While Mann didnt have sexual interest in him, Weinstein reached out to her and she did see him socially after the massage incident. At one party, Mann and Talita, an aspiring actress and her roommate, saw Weinstein; he asked to meet them in the hotel bar to talk about acting. It started with him saying I reminded him of his wife because I was clumsy, and she was clumsy, and he told me I was prettier than Natalie Portman, she said. He gave us criticism on both our images. He said that I needed to clear my skin up. He told Talita she needed to lose weight. He goes, You guys are perfect for this film that Im producing. Its a vampire film, and you both made perfect leads. The bar was closing and he urged them to join him upstairs. I said, Ha, ha, ha, oh no, I know what that means, she recalled, saying that Weinstein laughed at her and responded, I am a harmless old man. Weinstein was pacing. Mann and her friend are sitting on the sofa and he walked back into his room, she said. He called my name, she said, crying. Talita urged her to see what Weinstein wanted. I leaned in and I said, What do you want? she said. And then he grabbed my arm, and he pulls me around, and as hes pulling me around, he closes the door and he says to Talita, Well just be a minute. The more I fought, the angrier he got, she alleged. Weinstein then said, Let me do something for you. Im not letting you leave until I do something for you. He wouldnt tell me, she claimed. He told me to sit on the bed, and thats when he went down on me. I started to fake an orgasm to get out of it, she said. He asked me how it was, if I liked it. And uhm, I was nervous, so I told him, Oh, it was the best I ever had. I got out of there as fast as I could, she testified, saying Talita was asking, What happened? I said, We just gotta go and um, we left. I made the decision to be in a relationship with him, she later said. And part of that was because I was sexual with very few people. I entered into what I thought was going to be a real relationship with him  and it was extremely degrading from that point on. Mann said she was worried about breaking off a relationship with him. I thought he was gonna hurt my father, she said, explaining, he said to me that he has guys with bats  Mann was in New York with a friend who was on a business trip not long after these alleged encounters. Mann, her friend, and Talita were going to meet with Weinstein at the Doubletree Hotel on 51st Street and Lexington Avenue for a breakfast meeting. Mann was staying with her friend at this hotel. When Mann got downstairs, Weinstein was checking into the hotel. She confronted him to ask what he was doing. He pulled me aside, to the corner, and he told me not to embarrass him, she said. After Weinstein was checked in, he put his arm on her and started leading her upstairs. They started to argue in his room. He demanded that Mann get undressed. Mann tried to leave twice but he blocked the door, she alleged. Left without options, Mann said, I gave up at that point, and I undressed, and he stood over me until I was completely naked, and then he told me to lay on the bed, and once he was naked and laying on the bed, he walked into the bathroom and sort of closed the door behind him, she said. And then he came out naked and he was  he got on top of me, and thats when he put himself inside of me, his penis inside of me. After the alleged rape, Mann said she went to the bathroom. Im just trying to collect myself for a minute, and I see a needle in the trash can, and I flip out, and I grab it, and I look at it, and I remember the name, because I wanted to Google it, and I was  Mann started to weep at this point. It was the realization that he stabbed himself with a needle, and there has to be blood because he was inside of me  I was in shock over that. Asked whether Weinstein used a condom, Mann said, No. She was asked about the needle. I do not remember the medical term, but when I Googled it, it basically implied dead-penis-type thing, she said. They walked downstairs shortly thereafter. She did not tell her friend or Talita what allegedly had happened. At breakfast, Weinstein mentioned a movie premiere; Talita and her friend urged Mann to stay another day. They went to the premiere. He wanted me to have tea with him and his daughter right after, she said. I did not do that. He was mad. As Mann testified, several people in the courtroom rows reserved for Weinsteins team laughed. Mann then described an alleged incident at The Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel, which prosecutors said was in November 2013. She was in a relationship with a pretty well known actor, and had been avoiding Weinstein. She thought she had to tell him about her relationship. I was scared to tell Harvey, but I felt I had to do it, because I wanted integrity for our relationship, Mann said of her new boyfriend, saying she didnt want Weinstein to continue to behave as he had. During the course of my relationship with Harvey, he would tell me things like rules, You can date anyone you want, but not someone in the industry. I find that disrespectful, she said. Since I was dating an actor, I was particularly concerned about the actor. We were supposed to talk   And so I said to him, Harvey you know my dreams and my hopes of finding a relationship. And I want to get married. I want you to know that I met someone, that I already started a relationship  that this was very important to me to protect our sexual relationship. Weinstein demanded to know who her boyfriend was. I said, Im not going to tell you. He pressed Mann: Was it a banker? Was it an investment guy? A Wall Street guy? He goes, is it an actor? And I looked down  didnt say anything  and he knew, she said. When she refused to answer Weinstein, his eyes darkened and she said that, he ripped me up from my chair, from the table, and he was screaming, You owe me! You owe me one more time! As Mann recalled this, she sobbed. As he was dragging me into the bedroom, I didnt fall but I was having a lot of trouble keeping my balance, he was pulling me so fast. He threw me down on the edge of the bed, and he was demanding that I take off my clothes and I was begging him, she said sobbing, her breath strained. And I said, No, please, no! He stood over me, and he said, take off your clothes again, and I said no again, Mann testified. And he said, I dont have time for games, and he lunged at me with both hands and they went into my pants and he ripped my pants so hard, and so fast off of me, that I had three scratches down each leg, from the top of my thighs to the top of my knee, she said. Only the middle scratch had dots of blood that had come up, but there were three red marks. And it hurt and stung, like a paper cut, but deeper. And I froze, and I lost my voice, and I crawled back to the pillows, and I got in a ball, and I had no strength, she continued. I remember thinking, because he had walked into the bathroom, I was hearing myself saying, run, run, pull up your pants and run. Weinstein pulled her by the ankles and put his mouth on her vagina. He then penetrated her, Mann alleged. I just remember looking at the TV, and staring at it, and then it went black. I dont know if I passed out, she said. Next, she said she was on her knees, and hes shoving his penis in my mouth. Weinstein then climaxed, she said, and came in her mouth without her permission. And it choked me, and it was so bad, and when he was done, he went and laid on the bed, and I crawled into the bathroom on my hands and knees  to try to get out this taste in my mouth. And then he called me and I was scared, she said. And so I went out there after compressing my eyes with some cold water to try to hide the fact that I was crying. And he said, things like, okay now, now, you can go have your relationship and what you can do is you can bring me other girls. You can be my, what do they call it? A wing girl. Then he apologized to me, she continued, recalling he said, So sorry about earlier, I just find you so attractive, I couldnt resist. And then he would want me to answer him that were friends. Right yes, were friends. Yes, were friends   she said. Mann testified that she did have sporadic contact with Weinstein after this alleged incident, and had a consensual encounter with him in 2016. As the sloppily besuited Weinstein left court for the day, Vulture asked whether Manns description of his body was accurate. Yeah, perfect, he groused."
2,vulnerability,The_Donald,Geopolitical strategist Peter Zeihan's newsletter in response to the death of Soleimani,9,ejiacj,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/ejiacj/geopolitical_strategist_peter_zeihans_newsletter/,2020-01-04 04:07:08," ### Another Round in the Middle East? by [Peter Zeihan](URL on January 3, 2020 In the middle of the night January 3-4 an American air strike in Baghdad killed Qassem Soleimani, senior General of Iran's Qud's Force, arguably the second most important man in the Iranian state. The Americans blame Soleimani for masterminding hundreds of attacks on American forces. Soleimani was not simply a ""terrorist,"" but instead a very rare bird. He was a strategic mastermind who also knew enough about the nuts and bolts of military and paramilitary operations to actually direct them on the ground. The common folk in Iran getting uppity? Battlefield losses in Syria? Pro-Iran forces in Iraq facing popular uprisings? Tehran's answer was always the same: send in Soleimani to take control and use his command of the nexus of guns and protests and RPGs and politics and culture to rework the field of competition. He has been the Iranian fixer since the early 1990s. The ""spontaneous, popular"" assault on the American Embassy in Baghdad this past week was exactly his sort of operation. And with that assault, to be blunt, the Iranians went too far. The American force profile in the Middle East region has already dropped by more than 80%, and was well on its way to zero. Consider what has happened specifically during the presidency of Donald Trump: The Iranians shot down a $200ish million dollar recon drone. The Iranians doubled down on their Syrian and Yemeni operations. The Iranians threw a bunch of ordinance at Saudi oil infrastructure, taking more daily oil supply offline than any attack at any time in history. The Iranians deployed forces to crack down on anti-Iranian protests in Iraq. The American response to all of it was the same: nothing. But when it comes to embassies, the Americans get twitchy. In the aftermath of Irans 1979 Revolution, the Iranians seized control of the American embassy in Tehran and held its staff for over a year. In the American mind that singular event is what set the United States and Iran off on their half-century of mutual recrimination and loathing. (The Iranians singular event occurred somewhat earlier.) In throwing an attack at the Embassy, the Iranians resurrected a bogeyman from America's past, all but forcing a response. If the goal was to force the Americans to the negotiating table or speed their pullout, this move was seeped in unfettered stupidity. The Americans have proven that theyve had active tabs on someone who *really* mattered. Now the Iranians have to wonder who *else* the Americans have eyes on. The ""smart"" Iranian play at this point would be to suck up the loss of Soleimani and wait for the Americans to resume their drawdown. It is not clear ego will allow that. Irans near-immediate pledge of severe revenge would certainly argue that Tehran isnt going to quit while theyre ahead. Should Iran wish to engage in a constructive conflict, there really are not good options. US forces are mostly out of Syria, so there's no vulnerability for the Americans there. Americas Qatar deployment is their regional HQ, making it the very definition of a hard target. The only place US forces remain in a meaningful concentration is Saudi Arabia, where the Americans have put in a few thousand extra troops to protect Saudi oil fields. But if the Iranians attack those assets, the Americans are more than capable of using their naval forces in the Persian Gulf to return the favor, something that US Senator Lindsey Graham has opined is the likely next step. Specifically, Graham fingered Iranian refineries. (No one speaks for Trump but Trump, but Graham is the closest thing humanity has to a Trump whisperer.) And while Saudi Arabia has the cash and staff necessary to rebuild quickly, Iran does not. That just leaves Iraq, where attacking whats left of the American garrisons is a great way to invite more firepower in  firepower that will all be aimed at you - rather than escorting it out. None of which means the US can win either. That would take more troops. A LOT more. Keep in mind the American attempt at just Iraq took 100,000 soldiers and ultimately ended in failure. Troops in-country are now only about 5000. Tehran, Iran America's withdrawal from the region means the Iranians can make the Americans bleed, but only at the edges. The Americans can't win, but between satellites and drones and naval forces theyd have no problems making the Iranians lose, even if that loss would be far shy of regime change. And at the end of the day, the Americans are leaving anyway. (Which based on your point of view might be kind of a win?) Two thoughts from this: First, if the Iranians refuse to just let this go and strike out with the intent of killing US troops, this all goes in a direction pretty horrible for most of the region. The United States no longer has an interest in regional stability. It already has one foot out the door. In any broad anti-Iranian action the US would become the regions primary cause of *in*stability. Similarly, the Iranians (being an island of Shia in a sea of Sunni) see themselves as the odd men out and have no problem smashing anything that is not theirs. Most everyone would be in the crossfire with Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, and especially Iraq suffering the most. Second, so long as the Americans are gallivanting around sledgehammering all things Iranian, Saudi Arabia is pleased as punch because it means they don't have to do as much. It would enable Saudi to build up their regional terror networks under the cover of American power. That would get ugly fast, and much uglier later. Never forget that groups like ISIS are de facto Saudi creations designed to first and foremost counter Iranian power. We just got that chapter closed, and we may be about to open another one. Best guess? Odds are thats not how this will go. Iran lacks immediate retaliation options and so will have a chance to cool off a bit. Add in the clerical elites newfound concerns for their personal hides and *most* factors point to Iran *not* egregiously poking the Americans soon. And the Americans still. Want. Out. With every month that passes with no sticks in eyes, more US forces will have redeployed to less sandy pastures. But if we were talking about a perfect world, we wouldnt be talking about this region. You dont have to be an outsider to miscalculate in the Middle East."

Not just the best performance of the night but probably his best debate performance thus far. Bianca Vivion Brooks (9/10)  He was the toughest and most genuine candidate. His frustration with the state of health care, climate change and wealth inequality reflected the frustration of average Americans who are desperate for radical change. Ross Douthat (7/10)  Seemed fit, vigorous, very much himself: More with it than Biden, more straightforward than Warren. And the AOC endorsement as the capper! Michelle Goldberg (8/10)  Its nice to see that after his heart attack hes exactly the same as ever. Daniel McCarthy (7/10)  He has the same passion, same energy, same disregard for policy details as before the heart attack. And he was right to highlight his cooperation with Senator Mike Lee against the Saudi war in Yemen. Melanye Price (6/10)  He needed to show Democratic voters that he was healthy enough to stay in the race. He did that by answering questions about his health head-on. Mimi Swartz (7/10)  Less crazy angry uncle and more kind angry uncle this time around. Sharper than Big Joe throughout. Tanzina Vega (7/10)  He appeared lower on energy  though not on policy  than usual. Pete Wehner (6/10)  This debate is the first time I think Ive seen him smile. He also actually struck a grace note, and it happened in response to a question about his heart attack. The rest of the time he was the old Bernie. Will Wilkinson (8/10)  Sanders did not seem a bit infarcted, made the case for tax hikes Warren studiously evaded, and drew blood in his dissenting account of Bidens record of getting things done. &gt;Elizabeth Warren Charles Blow (10/10)  Elizabeth Warren is now the clear front-runner, even if the polls are not there. Everyone seemed to know it. She took fire from all sides. And she responded solidly, adroitly, even brilliantly at points. Jamelle Bouie (7/10)  To the extent that theres a front-runner, its Warren, and she was the target of virtually everyone. She had moments of weakness  her answers on health care are a real vulnerability  but she withstood the heat well enough. Bianca Vivion Brooks (8/10)  She had a weak explanation for how she would pay for Medicare for All but seemed to gain her footing when it came to taxing the wealthy. She was grounded, compelling and assertive. Ross Douthat (6/10)  Apart from her weird non-answers on Medicare and taxes, in her first front-runner debate, she was fine. But hardly untouchable, and not quite as great as her press coverage. Michelle Goldberg (6/10)  Im irritated by the demands that Warren give the right a talking point by saying shell raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare for All. But her inability to finesse those demands scares me to death. Daniel McCarthy (8/10)  Bruised but unbeaten. Her health care plan attracted skepticism over how she intends to pay for it, but she kept her cool and knows what she wants to accomplish. Shes a candidate working-class America might go for, and she sounds like a Democrat. Melanye Price (8/10)  She is unsinkable. They were all attacking her. She stood up to them without breaking a sweat. Mimi Swartz (8/10)  She held her own again, didnt get flustered and didnt need to get lost in convoluted dodges. Thank you, President Obama did the job. Tanzina Vega (6/10)  She came across as an academic mired in her usual talking points. Pete Wehner (4/10)  In an era when politicians are despised shes showing us that shes a quintessential politician: evasive, canned, rehearsed. She feigned shock at the charge that shes punitive toward billionaires and corporations. Im not sure why. Will Wilkinson (8/10)  Her stoutly poised defense against relentless attacks solidified the perception that the race is now Warrens to lose. Refusing to say shed raise taxes to pay for M4A hurt her in the debate but will help her in the race."

U.S. Department of Justice 600,000  800,000 people are bought and sold across international borders each year; 50% are children, most are female. The majority of these victims are forced into the commercial sex trade. (Source: U.S. Department of State, Trafficking in Persons Report, Washington, D.C.) An estimated 14,500 to 17,500 foreign nationals are trafficked into the United States each year. The number of U.S. citizens trafficked within the country is even higher, with an estimated 200,000 American children at risk for trafficking into the sex industry (Source: U.S Department of Justice Report to Congress from the Attorney General on U.S. Government Efforts to Combat Trafficking in Persons.) Investigators and researchers estimate the average predator in the U.S. can make more than $200,000 a year off one young girl. (Source: NBC Report by Teri Williams) Types of Enslavement: While we speak primarily about the sexual slavery of children and young women, the full spectrum of slavery/trafficking that we will deal with are: Sexual Slavery Sugar daddy relationship, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy. An estimated 2.5 million children, the majority of them girls, are sexually exploited in the multibillion dollar commercial sex industry. Child Soldiers Forced conscription into child militias or general military service. Bonded Labor Child sweatshops, or generational slavery inherited from parents enslavement. Domestic Servitude Children purchased to serve family domestic needs. Regardless of all these categories, the sexual exploitation of these children typically comes into play. For example, female child soldiers are often forced to be wives of older soldiers, domestic servants are often raped by their master, sweatshop kids are sexually exploited by facility managers, etc. Basically, once a child becomes any type of slave, their owners believe they can have their way with them sexually also. Most children, after being tricked, forced or coerced into slavery, are then trafficked away from their point of origin. That could mean being taken from their village and into the city, or from one country to another. Typically, its from poorer areas to richer areas (from places of greater need and vulnerability to places of more affluence and opportunity). But the trafficking also occurs to simply remove a child from a place of familiarity to one of confusion and dependence."
5,vulnerability,The_Donald,"I sort of wrote this by accident after a lot of reading, Papadopoulos testimony, Mueller report and all the references. Anyway z it's a long read but it utterly destroys the whole Mueller report before page 10, feel free to share",4,bknzes,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/bknzes/i_sort_of_wrote_this_by_accident_after_a_lot_of/,2019-05-05 04:12:00,"The Papadopoulos story, page 9 of the special counsel report.  I have posted a little about the Mueller report before here, it fascinates me to no end how open and transparent your democracy is. Something like this report would never see the light of day in Europe. The reason I write this, I did some light reading into this story. I started with the Papadop story because he was the named reason for the start of this counter intelligence operation on June 31, 2016. So, like they sang in the sound of music in the song do-re-mi, let's start at the very beginning.  The report: The meat of the report starts at page 9 (the first 8 pages are the index) and it starts with Papadopoulos. This is the third paragraph of the 9th page of the report, the first 2 are introductory: ""In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks' s first release of stolen documents, a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. ""  That may 2016 encounter can be found in the Papadop testimony (in closed session) before congress, this is Papadops testimony under oath (page 42 of his testimony): ""Question: Did Russia come up in the conversation with Downer? Answer: That's the point. I don't remember Russia ever coming up in a conversation with him. I just remember him telling me that he was an envoy to Cyprus, a U.N. envoy and that my ideas in that part of the world are very wrong. He was just very belligerent. I mean, it was a very hostile meeting. BY MR. BREITENBACH: Question: Were you inebriated or drunk during that meeting? Answer: Fortunately, the one thing he has corrected is that we weren't drunk, and we had one drink. Question: I'm sorry, you were not? (the news reports of that meeting claimed that Papadop was drunk and blabbed his mouth:URL ) Answer: We were not drunk. I was certainly not drunk, and I don't believe he was either.""  Anyway, that's the may meeting according to Papadop, and how the the investigation allegedly started. This is paragraph 4 of page 9 of the Mueller report. It gets really weird and this is what I want to talk about. remember, this is just the second paragraph with substance:  ""That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations,"" and, ""[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."" After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining Russia's interference in the election.""  The thing is, this is a really odd paragraph for a number of reasons, so I will split them up:  1) The 2 federal agencies statement(I included it here in total, we will get back to it but just notice the date: oktober 7, 2016): ""Joint Statement from the Department Of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security Release Date: October 7, 2016 For Immediate Release DHS Press Office Contact: 202-282-8010  The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscowthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.  Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.  Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber hygiene scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials. source: URL  2) ""After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election."" Just look up what Obama had to say about election interference before that date: URL So according to Obama on 18 oktober 2016, there is no evidence of rigging or hacking. Now, time to dig into the press release I mentioned in my first point, the one released 11 days before Obama's statement.  If you like music, put on The Doors - Strange Days right now.  First of all, let's introduce you to the leadership of those 2 federal agencies named by Mueller in paragraph 4 that authorized the press release. (Before I forget, I know Mueller was talking about this press release because I pasted this sentence from paragraph 4 into DuckDuckGo.com(for those of you that don't know what duckduckgo is, it's google with a robuster privacy protection, but if you paste the same sentence into google, you get the same result:  ""two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations""  it's verbatim in the press release)  Player One: Head of the DNI in 2016: James Clapper (URL  Player two: Head of DHS in 2016: Jeh Johnson (URL  Now, I think I don't need to tell you about Clapper, but just to be sure, he is the one that handpicked a couple of people from 3 agencies that wrote the infamous ""17 intelligence agencies"" report. (URL   Enough is said about him. The one I am interested in is player two, Jeh Johnson.  Here is why I am interested in him, his testimony before congress, under oath, on June 20, 2017. (URL  This is a direct quote from the testimony by mr. Johnson, 7 months after that press release: ""On August 3, 2016, in an on-the-record session with reporters, I publicly floated the idea of designating election infrastructure in this country as critical infrastructure. Twelve days later, on August 15, I convened a conference call with secretaries of state and other chief election officials of every state in the country. I told state officials that we must ensure the security and resilience of election infrastructure, and offered DHSs assistance to the states in doing that. I also reiterated the idea of designating election infrastructure as critical infrastructure. To my disappointment, the reaction to a critical infrastructure designation, at least from those who spoke up, ranged from neutral to negative. Those who expressed negative views stated that running elections in this country was the sovereign and exclusive responsibility of the states, and they did not want federal intrusion, a federal takeover, or federal regulation of that process. This was a profound misunderstanding of what a critical infrastructure designation would mean, which I tried to clarify for them.""  Now why is that? why didn't they want to cooperate? It isn't in the Mueller report, but I have a decent memory and I know there was a very good reason f"

An unborn baby is in the safety and security of its mother's womb so that it has a chance to fully develop while it's most vulnerable and dependent. It's only once the baby has fully developed and can handle the outside world, that the baby exits to womb into the world. Abortion is invading this space of safety and security and destroying the baby at its most vulnerable stage. Where does the logic come from that just because a baby hasn't yet been born into the world that it's somehow less human? If anything it is more deserving of care and compassion being it its vulnerable state. I can't think of any so-called toxic bullying that compares to invading the safety of the womb and murdering a human that is so absolutely in need of care and compassion to survive. It borders on a psychopathic mindset."

Please, hear me out...",1,an08oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/an08oz/this_might_be_controversial_but_i_think_the_ban/,2019-02-04 20:59:06,"We are all in this sub because we support President Trump. It is what unites us and brings us all together. Our group is a proud mix of Americans across the political spectrum. Some have always been extremely conservative, others are leftist that came here after seeing the rigged democratic primaries and some are moderates that were mislabeled by the left so they joined Team Trump out of spite. I can also safely say that most people, including myself, believe that the democrats infanticide bills are bat-shit crazy and entirely extreme. Even (some) people on the left are disgusted by how far the left has gone with their bills. It is the chronic extremism from the left that drives people to us. That and the fact that we are a pretty optimistic and cheerful group. However, the banning of all abortions is not a unified idea considering how diverse our group is. I am all for pointing out how crazy and extreme the left has become and highlighting that their bill is infanticide. But repeated posts of how all abortions must be banned is not unifying, it is divisive. There are people here that believe there should be a middle ground between the crazy termination seconds before birth and no abortions whatsoever. Some of us believe that women that were raped should have the choice as to whether they want to keep the child. Granted the baby is innocent, but the amount of harm that spawns from it can be immense. For instance, there was a story I heard recently about woman in a coma or in a vegetative state that was recently raped by a member of a hospital staff, and the family found out months later when she had a baby. Why should raped women have to suffer for something that was forced on them against their will? There is also the issue of whether a woman can love a baby that was the product of her being raped. Granted some women can, but there's also women that can't. Women that will constantly be reminded of the vulnerability and powerlessness when they were attacked. If the woman had the child and gave it to the state for adoption, the child would end up in the system and he or she would have a rough childhood and probably have some sort of psychologically trauma from the experience. Clearly the woman in the coma did nothing wrong, but if all abortions were banned then she would be forced to have a baby against her consent and be unable to provide for said child. Is the baby supposed to be raised by the rapist dad instead of going into the governments care? Or is the family supposed to get stuck raising a baby that is a reminder of their daughter being raped? If the parents are extremely old and both retired, do you think they would be able to find a job at an old age? One that could provide for raising a kid? God forbid that those parents pass away of old age and have the kid go into the screwed up system or the rapist dad... My point is, for a lot of moderates, there are is always variables that come into play that change the context of a situation. In the context of rape, some people think that there is an unfair burden placed upon the family by banning abortions completely. **TL:DR** We are united on a sub called r/The_Donald to show our support for the president, not because we all share the same views on abortion. The Democrats are completely fucking crazy and quite extreme with their infanticide bills. However, we don't all agree on the banning of abortions. We agree on Trump. For the continued unity of our group, I think this sub should remained focused on supporting Trump and making fun of the Socialist Democrats like Cortez, Bernie, Pelosi, and Assaulticus Booker. This is what unites us despite where we fall on the political spectrum. I believe that we should focus on posting content that unites us instead of content that might divide us. There is a sub for pro-life and a sub for pro-choice. This sub is meant to be **pro-Trump**."

Twitter algorithm can't discern legit, favored leftist propaganda from mockery. That's why they had to purge the NPC accounts by username/avatar -- they can't upset the algorithm. This is their weakness. &amp;nbsp; I think if we create enough of these accounts, Twitter will mistake us as part of the hive mind. Later when we find red pill gold we can distribute it flood leftist feeds who have followed Cylon accounts.

You will need to be brave and you will likely suffer losses. The alternative path is much easier. Its laden with excuses that deflect personal accountability. The truth that cowardice has been exposed by the conflict can be buried under layers of misdirection. Some one else should be blamed for making you feel obligated and responsible. Moral relativism needs a scapegoat. A language develops around the cowardice like a hard shell. The cognitive dissonance is enshrined like a pearl. Words take on a new, contorted meaning giving life to vague justifications. Reason is discarded in favor of rhetoric. Given enough time the practice of self aggrandizing becomes a lifestyle. Long forgotten are the tools used to build relationships and the methods used to communicate effectively. The mind is addled by emotional addiction and the addict can no longer tolerate the company of the fit and the sane. The smallest shift in culture or change to the immediate environment of the addict causes anxiety, anger and hatred. In its final stages the victim of their own emotional weakness, the coward, is in a state of dementia, mindlessly babbling away. Happy in their fantasy and surrounded exclusively by other addicts who share their powerful need for victimhood to mask their ineptness and fear. And when that frail status quo, that imagined superiority, that self deluded and drunken state of pure fabrication is disturbed the addict sees only an attack on its soft inner vulnerability and lashes out like a rabid dog. They eshew aid in the form of facts as though it were an intervention and the end of their carefree and wanton reveling. Imagine if addicts wanted to take over every aspect of authority in every vein of society. What would it be like if every dissenting opinion, like mirrors, were broken to hide their ugliness from them. That is the only future they can hope for. Total domination in a world that if allowed to govern itself would never allow the addict to forget it's choice, it's weakness and it's state of constant uncertainty.

Literally for the next 6 years we will see this every time Trump is in the news. Which will be a lot. Meanwhile, they take orders from the political establishment and media, who to support, how to think, what is OK to say, what to laugh at. It's sad. The left is currently a vacuum devoid of original thought, always waiting for their next marching orders from their betters. And this is their way of coping. I don't blame them given their apparent state of mind. What we need in this country is an independent group of leftists who are not under the control of the media/DNC.

I'm going to give Ford the benefit of the doubt and suspend judgment on how this affects her actual authenticity, but it should at least open the possibility that she was extremely ""handled"" for that delivery, which is par for the course with this situation. (If you don't think both sides were ""practicing"" during their prep to the hearing, you're extremely naive.) It's nothing anyone can say for sure without seeing her speak off the cuff prior to the hearing, which is probably impossible to find now, concerning how her online presence was virtually scrubbed. \---- I don't personally like to make judgments based on someone's demeanor and how they speak because anyone who has dedicated some study to this knows their are so many confounding possibilities due to someone's background and how they grew up. **People vastly overestimate their abilities to make judgments about people this way, which is why these are the things people ""in-the-know"" make a priority to manipulate.** I didn't actually get to watch Ford's opening statement until very recently, and I only got second-hand talking head chatter about how she was ""credible"" and ""authentic"". When I actually saw it, I was a bit shocked that was the 'general opinion'. When reading off her testimony, it felt more like what one would get while trying to express that sort of emotion during an audio book. **From my perspective, the way she spoke completely obscured anyway to get a real read on her.** I remember one particular commercial singing training method that had one lesson on this part of the voice and they gave this quote from the movie Tommy Boy as an example starting point for people to intuit the vocal coordination Ford was using: ""Brothers don't shake hands brothers gotta hug"" [URL People who don't normally speak that way as their everyday voice, do actually use it within their arsenal of inflection. An extremely exaggerated version is basically used when talking to babies and dogs, because it does generate a sense of being ""non-threatening"". People who do normally speak this way without influence from training or trying to maintain an affection of something like cuteness actually garble their words when they speak in this part of their voice, and you can't understand them because the are generating just enough air flow to almost close the vocal cords, but not enough for clear phonation. This is especially true under stress when they have to feel those emotions. Too much airflow, and you're actually going to get clear phonation and not get any of this vocal affection at all. In order to obtain clarity while still having this affection, you need some vocal tract coordinations that help shift some of the resonance. Some of the typical cues from Italian Bel Canto training is one of maintaining an ""inner smile"" or ""inhale as if smelling a beautiful rose into the vowel shape needed."" The over-exaggerated version we use for babies and dogs typically involves an exaggeration of this coordination, which is why it makes it seem brighter and happier. Obviously the continuum toward this exaggeration and brightness adds clarity at the expense of authenticity. It's not easy to authentically ""re-feel"" those emotions while speaking in such a manner that has the clarity to be ""understood"" at the same time while maintain a trace of the affection. **Trying to be emotionally convincing while doing so almost requires a paradoxical zen-like state of control and sense of calm (see polyvagal theory) where you can't actually be feeling those emotions if you want to have the control to actually convey those emotions.** \[The charitable explanation would have Ford need to be able to this in order to ""distance"" herself or ""calm"" herself, to even give a testimony in a public hearing.\] You're literally right on the edge of pin or balancing act.

I do not say this with any pleasure or ease, as each time the dysfunction of our government is announced, I am all the more sure in my study of the issue. Since the Kavanaugh hearings, I've been arguing in favor of returning to appointive, rather than elective, Senators, as the Founding Fathers intended.

In all the changes to which you may be invited, remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes, upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion, exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember, especially, that for the efficient management of your common interests, in a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property."" [URL &amp;#x200B; You see, the Framer's vested a degree of power, by trust, into the Senate (Superior Chamber of the Congress) that could not be trusted in the hands of newly, directly elected Representatives in the House (Inferior Chamber). The reason is due to the nature of how public opinion is chaotic and ever-changing, so it made sense to isolate Senators from this politicization, which simultaneously affords sovereignty to the Judiciary (directly undermined with an elective Senate), as the Senate also provides for the constitutional process of confirmation, among other authorities that rival the rest of the government, combined. When we were invited to alter our Constitution in recent decades, rendering Senators directly elected by the People, we were ill-informed, as it invited the instability of too much Democracy and began infecting other parts of the government, given the role of the Senate in administrating not only the Judicial, but the Executive branches of government. They were also meant to provide for a filter against the temporaneous and poor judgement of directly elected Representatives in the House for whom directly embody that furious and chaotic element of the oft-misguided, temporary and popular American opinion, which as evinced by swing-voting and other obvious political conditions, is far too unstable to be trusted in the hands of popularly elected governing bodies. The Framer's understood the American people could not always be well and best informed, which is why the government was originally structured in the manner of reference. Now, both Democrats and Republicans, particularly my Governor Rick Scott of Florida, are also inviting us to place term limits on Senators, which further destabilizes the Superior Chamber away from its original function, increasing its instability. What's next? Are we going to talk about reducing their term limit to 2 and 4 years? &amp;#x200B; You must understand, these types of changes are infectious, and we have witnessed, yet again, the inability for the Senate to discharge its Constitutional duties without apprehension for their constituency and politicization, affecting multiple parts of our government, decade over decade throughout the later 19th century. If the Constitution had remained unchanged, as it relates to the way by which Senators are placed into office, even the many futile wars and macro-economic policies that failed our country and receded our economy, would have likely never happened, as such policies and decisions were made out of Senators mere concern for being voted out and replaced by someone who would enact such, rather than the true function for which the Senate was meant to provide, reason and rational reflection on those oft-misguided intrigues we are too often invited. &amp;#x200B; The discharging of the Senate's constitutional duties must not be awed by the potent, unreasonable, unwise spontaneity of public opinion, rather it should be guided by the thoughtful wisdom of the U.S. Constitution, our literature and experiences which bequeath a guide that can only be followed in the absence of public opinion, where not optional, but required. Such powers reserved strictly for the Senate cannot be trusted, nor can we hold great confidence, when wielded by those popularly elected and of consideration to partisan discourses, thus holding hostage our constitutional processes reserved to the Senate. Yet, we dismissed the warnings of President Washington; we have made the fatal mistake of turning this all-important Superior Chamber into its belligerent, inferior House equivalent, by altering the Constitution in making Senators elective, rather than appointive. Thus, time and time again making the public administration more vulnerable to the threat of becoming the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests. Will we learn this time? Will the media, will our politicians, discuss the underlying cause of the ailments we observe in our administrative government? Will the People even grow curiosity in learning of how to resolve it? Will there be any attempt by those who understand the why in giving voice to its resolution? We must reverse the amendment that allowed Senators to be directly elected, restoring our Superior Chamber of Congress back to its original state; otherwise, what has been happening as a result of our ill-conceived alterations of our Constitution will only continue to worsen. &amp;#x200B; **(.... Interim conjecture by those who oppose reversal of the 17th amendment on the grounds of special interest concerns without any evidence ....)** &amp;#x200B; Rebuking the rebuttal opposing such reversal of the 17th Amendment on the ground of concerns for special interest representation, at the decline of the People's, is worsened by an appointive Senate, I began by replying ""it is the wealthy, might I add the middle and upper-class, who are most intent on preserving public liberty and constitutional rights, as well the functionality of government, in what exactly you are arguing against is in greater influence over the directly elective Senators, rather than if they were appointive. And, if they are appointive, it eliminates their need for potential bribery and corruption as you'd insinuate. So, you assume your elective Senators arent already dictated by the special interests you deride, when in fact this is increasingly the case when they are elective, rather than appointive. I ask you one question: how many district seats are there in comparison to Senatorial seats? 435 House seats vs. 100 Senate seats. Now, let me ask you another question: when was the last time you saw ANY ad for a local district runner or incumbent, and when was the last time you saw ANY ad for ANY STATE (Senatorial and Governor) runner or incumbent? Exactly. This proves my point that the centralized, most wealthy lobbies, cannot handle, do not have the time, ad space or money required, to manage elections on the district level. And, if your concern is giving back power to the people, then translating future Senatorial appointees by those who do represent the American people most, the district level House, would be the way to go, if not out-right eliminate, at the very least give We the People more competitive power as originally intended, overzealous special interest groups, including overgrown political institutions and parties, to determine the makeup of our Senate  they simply wouldnt be able to handle micro-managing 435 House seats year-round, and this I know for a fact. Consider another variable, in that a Senatorial seat is up for reelection at a lessened rate than those of the House, which further indicates greater difficulty for special interest groups and corporate media to determine our voter behavior, if again, we reverted back to appointive Senators. &amp;#x200B; So, this brings me back to my original argument that appointive Senators are best for everyone, except those who wish to take away power from us and seek to politicize the constitutional functions of the Superior Chamber of the Congress, while simultaneously stripping power away from rural areas that haven't the funding and corporate interests to bring home a return on their vote by lobbying cross-border against the international corporate interests of urbanized/coastal elite sections of our country; we could and should restore fair balance by reverting back to appointive Senators. Elective Senators merely creates a Superior Chamber that requires absolute loyalty to those special interests which dictate our popular opinions, and you have also dismissed that fact the House is directly accountable to localized constituencies within their district. Think about the differences between national, state, and district level electives. What model do you believe most accurately represents and encompasses the breadth of diversified interests within our country? Obviously, it is the district elective, as a State-wide elective serves only to alienate a greater number of people. Therefore, I can say I'd trust district representatives more in selecting their ascendant Senators because the House most represents their constituency at the localized level, while simultaneously trusting an appointive Senate to discharge their constitutional duties in the manner prescribed by the Constitution, without consideration of public sway, except to that of the House. The only people who would want things to stay the way they are now are corporate or partisan democrats and republicans, who use propaganda to manipulate voter behavior and other illicit and questionable means of attaining power and would not have the resources to ensure theyre able to select our Senators for us by requiring the micro-management of district-level House Reps., if Senators were to be appointive by the House. &amp;#x200B; Thus, I conclude not only does an appointive Senate most insulate the government from that which you fear, but it also provides for a buffer against those popular and ill-conceived opinions thatre most easily and uniformly managed and inflicted at national and State levels rather than those district, which do seek to politicize the additional authorities of the Senate, not in a way that serves your best interests because by nature of design it cannot accommodate for them in an elective Senate. If the House selects our Senators, by nature it is a vested representation, district by district, in the determination of those to ascend. Where you, and all of those who were convinced of elective as best went wrong was in not understanding the Constitution in its fullest body and what it was intended and does do, as originally written, opening our government to susceptible and permeable vulnerability, disgracing the gift my ancestors bequeathed to all of us. You quipped with an arrogant assumption without considering the functionality of the Constitutions originally appointive Senate in practice. Cant you see? Everything you are claiming as supportive arguments for a purely elective Senate is in fact amplified under an elective Senate, worse yet it fundamentally jeopardizes the entire bureaucracy, as the evidence of this few-decade experiment proves. Now, where is your evidence to the contrary? Furthermore, basic arithmetic proves my argument true. &amp;#x200B; So, what have we learnt here? The reversal of the amendment you argued in favor for, which is one that made Senators purely elective rather than appointive by a purely elective, larger body that by mathematical impossibility cannot be managed by those dear-devil ""special interests"" you railed against, is in fact the best way to protect yourself against that very fear. &amp;#x200B; One more thing to my fellow readers; don't ever think you have any formidable intellectual capacity equivalent to or greater than the Founding Fathers, because you don't, and the moment you become confident you do, is the moment you never visit their literary arguments in having written the Constitution as it was in originality, thus prompting your expedient and uninformed alterations made to the Constitution which undermines the energy of the entire system and leads to its eventual collapse or divestment into tyranny. Your arrogance will betray you, I promise you that, and I believe my above commentary speaks self-evidently for this fact. Everything, to the ability in making a stand toward the abolition of slavery, was preconceived and known as something which would eventually be achieved, by those who wrote the Constitution, before it was even ratified, as President Washington's journals prove.""

They had some lady on there talking about her book, and it seemed like an okay book... maybe. I haven't read it. It's something about how leadership and courage involve some level of vulnerability to be successful. So she's talking for a while, then one of the co-anchors is like ""I hate to get political"" (no you don't, liar)... ""but right now we have someone in the White House whose biggest strength seems to be showing no vulnerability""... (you dumbass, he's been more vulnerable than any politician I remember in my lifetime)... Lady who wrote the book kind of smirks and says ""I'm glad you went there... because the opposite of courage is fear, and one way to get people behind you is to take their uncertainty and guarantee certainty. But fear has a short shelf life"" ad nauseum... Seriously? You can't talk about the fucking book without making it about Trump and making a bunch of false assertions? So basically they used this book lady's segment to try to sound like they they were ""intelligently concerned"" for us poor dumb halfwits who are just ""uncertain"" and being duped by a snakeoil salesman. President has more courage in his toenail than that entire panel put together... and has made himself immeasurable vulnerable...that I can tell you. :) So I guess it's back to no msm for me. I tried to give them a chance and all they can do is prove that their TDS knows NO BOUNDS."
20,vulnerability,The_Donald,I dropped this in an online discussion and was told I was factually misleading. Where am I wrong?,22,90hr0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/90hr0a/i_dropped_this_in_an_online_discussion_and_was/,2018-07-21 03:04:06,"I have an honest question and it's not meant as a troll. Let me preface this by saying that when I am looking at the issue of whether Trump has been a puppet of Putin or not, I do not look at either the SCI (as Mueller has yet to close and either present his findings or press charges associated with campaign collusion charges at Trump or a close associate) nor do I look at the findings of the current House Investigations under Nunes, Grassley and IG Horowitz (as the full scope of the IG report and any subsequent criminal charges will not be known until the third report on FISA abuses and any charges coming from the Huber grand jury are revealed.) So if I eliminate those two incomplete data sets, what am I left with? Off the top of my head, I come up with this: 1. Trump provided lethal armaments to the Ukraine after the annexation of the Crimean region when his predecessor did not. 2. Trump provided missile defense to Poland which his predecessor scrapped. 3. Trump has refused to do anything about the Magnitsky act and his subsequent economic sanctions on certain Russian oligarchs has actually been a doubling down on Magnitsky 4. Trump has been actively opposed to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline Russia desperately wants to build to ship Russian gas directly to German markets and has actively tried to replace Russian gas exports to NATO with American exports. 5. Trump's commentary to Germany during the recent NATO meeting (as rude as they were) highlighted that Germany was exposing a Strategic vulnerability to the very opponent NATO was meant to oppose by relying on somewhere between 60 and 70 percent of their gas supplies from Russian Markets. He is correct that there is a difference between energy and trade. We have a strategic oil reserve for a reason. 6. Trump's entire position at NATO was that they need to spend more in defense against potential Russian aggression. 7. Last February/March, Trump green lit the destruction of an entire battalion of Russian mercenaries when they failed to stop advancing on an American held position in Syria. Hundreds died. I've read several articles on it and the causality rate (between dead and wounded) was close to 100%. Against that, I recall that during the election, he joked about Putin finding (not hacking) Hillary's lost emails and standing on the stage with Putin, he failed to defend his civilian intelligence agencies against Putin. Keep in mind that IG Horowitz and John Huber are actively pursuing an investigation into FISA abuses which if true, were carried out by Obama's civilian intelligence heads. So if I step back from the incomplete Mueller and FISA abuse issues, I have a very hard time reconciling the top part of my list with the actions of a Putin stooge. I'm not a hard core conservative. I fall somewhere between Centrist Democrat, Moderate Republican and pro 2A Libertarian. What am I missing, because I see two open cases (the SCI and the IG) and a lot of actions that taken in aggregate are very hostile to the man you say is pulling Trump's strings."
21,vulnerability,The_Donald,Society,2,94u5my,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/94u5my/society/,2018-08-06 04:49:48,"\*\*\*Disclaimer this was written while on mushrooms lmao\*\*\* \*\*\*\*I think it's relevant here. Anyway, you should try mushrooms once a year! It's basically like cheating in meditation or something, I have no clue to be honest.\*\*\* \*\*\*\*We have an issue with saying that positive and negative are dichotomous feelings. When in actuality they must constantly work together to self actualize. It is negativity that brings us awareness. Thats why the more we try to drown it out, the harder it resurfaces. You no longer have to consider how to frame your words When you experience both feelings at the same time - you know your words are authentic, you are suppressing nothing within yourself. We are constantly fighting suppression - every day. We are unable to be genuine to one another, and we are unable to listen. This is because we are so indoctrinated with dichotomy between positive and negative feelings. The most tragic thing of all. Is we dont have an unlimited amount of time to live. So why do we keep pretending we have to suppress everything we feel? It is because we have to be accepted in order to survive. And because we have to function progressively - which takes focus on the external. But right now we are focusing on the internal Which is a completely different beast And that is why it cannot be measured. Because the internal is how we form the external And that is why it has value to look in on it Because it frames the lense in which we operate regularly on the external. Why have we created a society in which it is so hard to compromise. And to see beyond oneself? Because people take advantage of the good hearted. That has always been true. There are people who are evil. They find amusement. Because the human condition is both. Both altruistic and sadistic. We humans crave power. If we can have something we can have more. Why would we stop wanting when we could have everything? That is ambition. Ambition is a God. It creates an incredible energy. As is the human spirit a wave It captures the crest and says, we can go further! There are truly no bounds That is why ambition is a God It takes us beyond what we thought was possible. Because we truly can achieve what we believe is impossible. It is possible. Ambition is that belief. And so we hate on those who do not share this wave of energy. And we value in those who display it. Ambition is a beautiful thing. So we capture the soul of the human psyche. That to move forward, there is no impossible. But there are constraints. We need constraints. Ambition without considering reality. Causes suffering in its hindrance or absence of Until it finds out how to help the suffering. Constraints keep us aware. That is the balance between positive and negative. That is why they both must work together. And that is how one knows they are authentic. Because there is no doubt in their words. For their words are rooted in both the combination of negative and positive. That they are able to operate. While still achieving for the stars. This is the God complex. This is the internal. To not understand it is narcissistic. It holds us back to not understand. But ultimately it is rooted in the aforementioned anxiety. That is why the effects of social media must be studied. But this sensation is - not human. What I am experiencing is something due to the mushrooms. There is some kind of other feeling to it. The hyper stimulation is unnatural. And to that I also am seeing all kinds of colors. It is a hyperfocus. Any anxiety one has. Dont let shame take hold of you You will find that amusement is insidiously lying inside your insecurities soon You will find you wish ill of others. Eating mushrooms it is as though you are infected by them. As though something else has taken over That you are experiencing your senses through it, for the first time. You will find an act such as eating, weird. I know this sounds bizarre. But that is why it feels like something else has taken over. There is no explaining it. But you cant be afraid of it when you experience it. You have to embrace the sensation your mind is giving you. It is an incredible experience. You must accept it with the spirit of ambition if you truly want to dive into it. Suddenly everything becomes enhanced. Its almost like...it wants to suck you right up So just let it. You feel thankful and have the need to nest and get ready before the experience. I know this might sound weird but Your ego wants to feel bad. It is what is always holding you back. Internally. This is about looking at the internal. But external is extremely important. Because how we feel only matters in how we interact with others. But it is also egotistical and powerful To say that Which is why the positive and negative aspects must coexist at the same time And that is what makes it authentic. We humans have a very bad sense of There is no word for it. Like venom. It's the craving for power. Whenever we get something we want more. That is why discipline is so important in children And they instantly recognize it if theyre taught at a young age. Because discipline reminds ambition that the desire for power exists. And power is what turns individuals evil. Makes them forget any desire for empathy. Why feel for something you cant understand? That is the human condition - it works both in the extremities of positive and negative emotions. That is why the phrase centered has always existed, yin and yang. It is authenticity. There is no confusion when you experience it. Still I feel like there is something else here. As soon as an individual feels like they are special, they are drawn to power. It is a strange human desire. It is bred out of insecurity. And the truth is that the insecurity is often rooted in sad things. But reversely it is also propped up by being born into a status where there needs no empathy. And this is a worse situation yet, because it rids an individual of their ability to learn. Because no matter ones status. In the end we are going to die. The concept of Altered Carbon was so interesting to many because It is what happens if power is left unchecked. Now I experience a state of confusion- It is the feeling of all feelings combined into one. And we instantly find a solution for this- But herein we find the interesting part of disregarding empathy Because what in the confusion did someone see? And how is it still obtainable. And so suffering can work hand in hand with ambition And that is what the powerful do not see That there is so much more that could be brought to the world Then just through their own eyes. And so the concept of self is dissolved. They call that ego death But really its just getting rid of amusement. Amusement is not a good thing. That is the truth behind discipline. But we live in an imperfect world. Where many advantageous come from being clever. That is why power exists. That is why power has two branches, and one is from insecurity - the other more sad - the inability to learn. Learn about the potential of the world that can see beyond just what they can see. But to experience their reality is to experience shambles. It is a compromise on both sides, to elevate one side up. It is both ego death, and it is both - It is one and the same. To be truly selfless. There is no feeling of pleasure to accompany selflessness. It is a sensation in itself of a self righteous cult. That is the Virus of Art. Art is beautiful. People pursue art They have always tried to find it. That is why the side of those who are powerful - is much more sad. (The two branches). Art is being. It is constant. It is not forgetting. It is maturity. But it is maturing into oneself. That is why they call it growing up. Have empathy for those who do not understand. Have no hate for the powerful. Have no hate for those in shambles. Only operate in the external with ambition - and never forget being. It is okay if people do not understand you. It is okay if people enjoy their power. Just stay true to your vision. Your vision for humanity. Do not become lazy - That is the fact- People become self indulgent in their sadness. That is why it is always meeting halfway. Depression is a disease of the mind. It creates a cult onto itself - the same as powerful. Have empathy for it. Power is a hard thing to turn away from. Just remember why people want to have it. And work towards ways where it can be possible. Learning is only obtainable through being. Through discipline. Through maturity. To be honest, the ranges of human emotion are on an individual level, so extreme, that it is very obvious why some people try to turn to others try to get away from the gravity of their own worlds. Sometimes it feels as though for individuals there is no way to be centered. This is a blessing because it allows them to have great empathy for a very wide array of psychologies. Do not feel shame in your abilities. But do not feel power either. Manipulation is so easy for the powerful. That is why the opposite exists in those who are sad. Ultimately both sides are striving for a better future. Which is only obtainable through being. Because future is a state of mind. I think screens maybe phone screens may have some kind of reflective quality to them - damages the eyes. See - there is an external observation Here is where it enters the internal frame. The powerful can manipulate an entire population around a response to an external stimulation. But why? Why do humans busy themselves with things that dont matter? That is why it is important to be. But still remember the beauty of ambition. There is much we can learn from Chinese culture. No wonder they held so much animosity for us. But we reveal what power truly is. And once again being is a self righteous cult - it does not want to be called out. That is religion. Religion is a farce. That is why the Chinese like Western Culture. We held a wider range of what it meant to be human - the empathy. But without discipline it becomes revolting. That is the beauty of entertainment. It prays on the insecure. That is why shows like Jersey Shore, whatever else. Are so secretly watched by the most vulnerable. And this is what is so revolting about American culture. That is why its so important to be. Otherwise we fall into the trap of ego. It seems so alluring and fun. But it is disingenuous. Soon we are chasing the authentic. Soon we are chasing Art. It becomes sad. But what is more sad - is those who have no ability to learn. Who hold those who are chasing in contempt. Do not hate the powerful. And here we have became so infatuated with the internal. But because it is the border between what we do with the external. It is so important. That is when people are saying This is a Work of God They mean Ego - Death And atheists demise it Because it underscores the idea of suffering. The most vulnerable are drawn to Religion. And the Virus of Art is taking on that which is the highest sense of self. For self does not exist. That is what Ego Death is That is God. Allah. It is being. It is potential. In existence. It is beautiful. This is the internal. Cherish it. That is the beauty that the powerful endlessly chase. Do not hate them for it. Cherish it because the world will try to take it from you. It is sad and it is strange. Do not succumb to the gluttony of suffering. Just be glad. Each and every day. Just be glad. And hope that the world will change. And hope that the world can change. But change begins with you. On the external. It is good to feel sadness. It means that you are aware. It means that you understand ambition. It is okay to be confused. That the world can be so cruel. To one another. That is power. Power and confusion. Is only bred from insecurity. And from the most sad - those that cannot learn. Then to those who cannot learn. The worst is possible. They must be condemned to suffer. For all of us eventually die. And without having learned, they will have to learn at the very end of it all. With time our most beautiful and beloved gift of all. To so quickly be taken from them right when they finally understood. It is just sad. For they for so long existed only in the realm of the external, Only to have it all come crashing in at once far too late. We exist in a society. But we do not have to be cruel to one another. To help each other learn. It is hard for the external to understand. The suffering. It annoys our ambition. Things must be done. Why waste your time on things that are slow? Maybe there are things that can be seen in the slowness. Why cant we take our time? The world of the external is faced in restrictions. We have to make compromises. It isnt easy. A lot of people are struggling. It is hard to see others in shambles. It reminds us of what we ourselves are most scared of. How strange that a child crying in public. Is silenced? Shouldnt a society be judged on. How it treats its most vulnerable? When a society prays on art, suddenly art itself has become some kind of bitter archetype. Because the cynicism is that it is already being turned into some way to be exploited. There are many issues in society. Why would we want to add to them with the internal? Why would we want to add to them with power? With narcissism? What has become of us? Have we so lost our identity? Dont let this awareness. Give way to anxiety. To disdain. Find hope in others. Find hope in them to learn. And the ones that have. Never lose them. And never let them forget. Because the world is cruel They will take everything from you It has become so narcissistic. That even the strife of individuals Becomes a spectacle. That the strife of individuals Is used to claw into archetypes for us vs. them Vulnerability is beautiful And it should be cherished. In religion they symbolize this with the lamb and the lion. The lion protects the lamb because it knows what the lamb is. The lamb is being before God Being before Ego death. And the Lion is the power that protects what they would call Utopia For Utopia is constantly barraged by power itself. Power that does not understand - because it has not yet learned. That is why those who do not understand and have no interest in learning must be made to suffer Because they bring the greatest suffering to humankind. Great works of Art are truly free. They are not monetized. They only hope that people will listen. How society reacts to a crying child. Judge the society for that. Do they look concerned on the outside - but are vicious on the inside? And then what are the causes for that viciousness? Because they know their society is cruel, and they are trying to protect their child - the most innocent, from emerging into such a narcissistic world. They dont want their child to be taken away so quickly into that world which seeks to trap them. Yes it is sad. The child who is silenced, is made to feel as though they do not have the right to exist. But when a voice is magnified, it is given pride - and that pride forgets the voice of others. Pride must be made to suffer. So that it can help those who are suffering. That is a society that is constantly helping itself. But all these ideals seem very meaningless in a narcissistic society. That is why identity can start to feel lost. Because suffering in itself is narcissism. Ambition sees this and calls it out. But then why do individuals become cruel? Because we only have so much time. But then how are we spending it? I hope we are happy And I hope we are helping others. I hope we are not narcissistic. That is why humanity experiences high and low. And they chase being centered. In time everyone learns. Or it reaches them at the very end. Thats why Altered Carbon was so interesting. Power unchecked - that could infiltrate the internal It is a way to convey to the external the breath of the internal - That is why people chase psychoactives or dive into psychology They take what is beautiful and they parade it around. The rest of the world becomes disinterested. People are only interested in what they see. So if you feel you want to be a certain way, you have to be it. There is no getting around that in a narcissistic society. But dont forget who you are. And try to help others remember who they are. That is the most important thing you can do. And never forget how beautiful Ambition really is. Spend everything you can on trying to help others. And never forget their suffering. The crying child in society- They are inside all of us- They try to seperate us from each other By making us anxious or narcissistic. They call it Dog eat Dog World Why has it came to that? That is the world of narcissism. They say, we dont want to agree with each other. People take advantage of each other. Because everyone is in it for themselves. Look for those who bring out power in others. Who try to make everyone else powerful. Those are the lions in society, Protecting the lambs. Because our world is narcissistic. It is cruel. We are scared of each other. We live in a constant fear of the other displaying something shameful about oneself. We have became a world that tries to tear people down. We itch and claw for any reason to hurt someone else. And we wonder why we dont feel any identity? We wonder why people chase for things? If you have captivated someones attention. It is a good thing. It means maybe they have the chance to learn. That is the beauty of (the archetype) the Fool. We wonder why the external is so at ends with the internal? It is because so few are centered. How can you be centered if you laugh at the misery of others? It has gotten to the point where misery has become monetized. Because it is entertaining. Because that is how much people hate. Why do they hate so much? What has happened to us? Have we forgotten our mortality? Are we so narcissistic that we think we are above God? That we are above Ego Death? That we are above shame? It is absurd. That is why something so simple as art. Is chased on. If inflation is an external (measurement) for value. What word have we for such a syndrome internally? Perhaps they are one and the same A reflection of the self. And we have pitted ideologies against each other. Ideologies that stand for the same thing. How insane the world has become. This Dog eat Dog World This is the world that power brings. What a beauty to behold. Where beauty is the greatest treasure. And yet no one can find it. But there is so much beauty in it. We find it in other people. Money has become such an interesting thing. Externally it is fantastic as it is a means for trade. But somehow trade got hijacked. Those who manipulate - the powerful. The truly powerful. They took a symbol to humanity of trade. And they changed it. Not only that, they started prancing it around. How many youtube videos of men driving lamborghinis so they can get all that puss Something truly bizarre has happened. Money was meant to be sacred. It symbolized the sacred bond that an individual gave something - time, and formed it into an external, tangible asset. Yet now we see plastic mass manufacturing. Something truly bizarre has happened. No one is talking about it. Because we are all scared. We are all anxious. And those of us who are not, are narcissistic. Inflation. Im talking about inflation. The housing market, the truest sense of being and purpose, Simply a place to exist. Now it has become normal to think of homelessness. Homelessness. What a sick and disgusting phrase. Dont you understand? Its a phrase of manipulation. It has normalized such a horrifying situation. And to encapsulate it in a phrase means now it is used to derogify. You dont want to be homeless do you? How disgusting would that be? And we wonder why they get drunk? (Not to enable) How our society treats our most vulnerable? As absolute scum. As filth. As disdain on my shoe. And somehow this is okay, because, its a Dog Eat Dog world out there. What the fuck has happened to us? No wonder we have absolutely no fucking identity. And the one man who is standing up for us. Our President. But simply a lion among lambs. Is being torn away by all these narcissistic media outlets. That claim without any evidence that he is a Puppet for Putin. These same reporters that spit at the homeless. Do you understand that? They spit at them. Because they believe that the jobs that could be provided for them should be taken by people who are illegally entering our country. We have a legal system because we have to protect our citizens. We have to PROTECT OUR HOMELESS. They need jobs too. They are OUR people. And though it is unfair that we were born here, We are not asking you to adopt your own policies. But you can if you want. You can look at your own government. You can ask how you can change it. And you can try to change your own government. You can listen to people. You can listen to the people who say I think phone screens might be damaging to our eyes. Instead of thinking that that would be a weird thing to say. You can listen to them and you can ask those who are incredibly smart externally to help. And you can compensate them for their time. That is where things have become so lost. Money was always meant to compensate people for their time. Those who are smart spent time learning. Yet now we jeer them and admonish them. We call it entitlement Whatever that means. How ironic that saying entitlement is narcissistic. It is the cult of suffering to call others entitled. It is so far removed from the state of being. But money has been taken from us. Money as the symbolization of time. Our most precious resource. Time itself therefore has externally been made into an object of narcissism. (Through money). Those who call others entitled understand this. And so once again we have been pitted against one another. The powerful are too good at what they do. And they dont care. We have someone who is trying to stand up for us. To have fair trade deals so mass manufacturing overseas cant take place. So that the symbolic gesture of creating something is once again restored to our monetary policy. They will try everything they can to tear him down. But he is a lion for all those in our country who are suffering. For all of the lambs who are too scared to speak in a world of narcissism that will bite them down for talking about their real economic woes, of crime, of education, of job prospects. Why do they hate us for trying to secure our borders? Dont they understand we have to take care of our own people? Why do they hate us for trying to bring back jobs? Dont they know people want their time to mean something? When has greed become so strong. That people no longer care about one another? That it has taken over other countries. And we want to protect the shining beacon of hope that is the American Dream? Because that beacon is a symbol to other countries. That they can put forward leaders that put their countries first? That care about their most vulnerable? That care about THEIR homeless? It is important to be a patriot. But it is important to not feel pride. Because a patriot is a term for lion. Lion of one's people. And only when our people are good, can we then move to help others. Like a sickness, we must first recover before we can begin to run. Both internally and externally. As one. That is the power that drives the concept of Utopia ever forward. An idea that must never be given away. For the world is tough. But it is worth bearing if you know your time is spent contributing to a society that you want to be a part of. And that society has an obligation to help you find best use of your time. Because time is the most precious resource. Any good government understands that. Any good government advances that. There is no need for narcissism when one has purpose. Because they understand that they are acting for God (Ego Death). When a society is able to generate this culture, their potential is unstoppable. Ambition - the God of humanity that it is - will have no limits. When that day comes, I hope Ambition is not lost. And that it can remain in a constant state of being. Never forget how easy it is to forget what you have learned. Always protect those who are learning. Always hope that people will want to learn."
22,vulnerability,The_Donald,I just voted in the Wa state primary. It is the most vulnerable voting system I have ever seen. 100% mail in ballots. You can not feed your own ballot into a machine.,23,95e4j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/95e4j1/i_just_voted_in_the_wa_state_primary_it_is_the/,2018-08-08 04:18:20,"I have been chewing people out all morning. My ballot was not delivered to my home, so I called to find out where I could vote in person. I WAS THEN INFORMED THAT WASHINGTON IS A MAIL IN ONLY STATE. I could go to the election center and pick up a ballot to ""mail"" in on site, but there was no way to put my vote in a counter myself. After I got my ballot from the helpful and sympathetic front desk I was directed to another desk to see if there was a way that I could verify my vote was counted by submitting it myself. The assclown that I initially schooled kept insisting that the system was impenetrable and perfect. He was soon asked to leave by his boss after I humiliated him by breaking down his defense and the system's vulnerability barney style. His boss told him to leave after I requested a complaint to be sent up and he failed to write anything down. I fake walked away to see if he would attempt to write anything down to be passed up, he didn't and I called him on it. His boss showed up once I started ripping into him for not verifying my identity or making any effort to take a messege. His boss then acknowledged the weakness in the system and that their hands were tied bu the state law."

Over time We the people have unwittingly allowed ourselves to embrace one dimensional thinking i.e. work hard, pay bills, save money etc.at a time where a creative few have amassed as a collective and supported one another to put in place an agenda that is to heal their self-confidence and reward them for their viewed inequities of the past. Now that reasonable people have awaken, we must understand that our vote is the power towards healing a nation. We humans are not just connected by groups we are all the embodiment of a quest or journey if you will to look for the solution to life, direction to go in life, a path to stay on in life, and more importantly the confidence to step up in life when opportunity arises. A reality I believe is being overlooked by the masses is that WE ARE THE SOLUTION It is called our instincts. What I can see about President Trump is my ability to identify with his instinctual path. I dont have to know him personally to know that we are similar in confidence and resolve. I too am a person that people rely on to assist them in a time of vulnerability. I promise nothing but a solution. Right or wrong it is a solution; the moment will be resolved. It takes courage to think of ones best interest and there is a faction that would eagerly do it for you if you are troubled by the difficult thoughts and lack of effort. The statements To follow and/or To lead, these are just phrases to me. To be willing to sacrifice for your decisions, ideals, gut feelings, etc that is the solution to me. Its simply have faith in the process and not allowing the obstructions of imput to derails your decisions. As a 55-year-old single parent of a 13-year-old I am inundated with thoughts that only have one direction. The preservation of mine! My soul purpose is hard at times to maintain. It is to control my thoughts of selfishness and maintain a course of selflessness for the greater good of my lineage. It is the ultimate gamble for a man or woman. Will the next generation possess the passion to build a family of success? That is what the fortunate are accomplishing, why not me. I got one shot and as far as Im concerned one shot, one kill. I have plans for my family to have meat on the table for decades to come. A nod to the 2nd . I speak my mind now a days with the understanding of being refined when doing so as not to lose a mind in need. Nod to the 1st. Just had a thought and wanted to share."

It was a big FUCK YOU to the establishment. We all did our part and defeated a rigged system to get this man into office and we should be proud of ourselves for that. But now things get tough. November 8th wasn't the final victory - it was the start of a new hope that we had for our country and a shout out to all the corrupt politicians and crooks in charge that we won't take their shit anymore. But we've gotten soft, and we let the crooks start winning again. &amp;nbsp; That feeling you felt when Roy Moore lost is a lesser version of the feeling the liberals felt on November 8th. You feel anger, frustration, and vulnerability, and most importantly you are MAD. But you won't stoop to their level because we are better than that. We won't run into the streets with pitchforks calling Doug Jones a fake senator (even if there's a chance he is). But we have to do something. They will lie, cheat, and steal their way to the top because that's what political Democrats do, and they will feel no remorse. To them it's well deserved payback. The worst part is - They WILL win unless we do something to fight back. &amp;nbsp; Our voices are silenced by the media, so it's up to us to find other ventures where we can be heard. The_Donald is our headquarters but the action takes place on the streets. Did Roy Moore really do the things they accused him of? Doesn't matter, because it worked. Innocent until proven guilty is for the courtroom - in a political race all that matters is public opinion. And the public opinion was swayed just enough to allow a Democrat to take Alabama. This wouldn't have been possible without the smear campaign and they KNOW it. And they won't stop either. They are only beginning to taste the joys of winning, and we are forced to deal with it in our own confines of the internet. Face it - we weren't heard this election, yet we could have been. As a group we have to find a way to fight back. At this rate 2020 is not a lock. Instead it is a BIG ""?"". If we lose that one you can bet we'll never win again. Are you okay with that?"

Alexander claimed not to know. Then the chief of staff was suicided. Edit: Some distrusting pede wanted a source. URL Pedes don't lie to each other. Next time have some faith. Fyi there is a lot of woerdness with TN Republicans that indicte they might be swamp and have been for a long time lots of stuff that the party kept secret . Such as sen corkers daughter is a lesbein URL (mccains daughter is also a lesbian. ) There was a lot of speculation that Corker used to be a good non swamper bit was threatened with his daughter being attacked which changed him after she was. Former knoxville mayor victor ashe was caught in the bushes with another man in chattanooga where bob corker was mayor before becomi g senator. Lamar alexander had a homosexual child porn distrubution center being run out of his office by his chief of staff who was then suicided. (the issue is how does thathappen with you not knowing if its your chief of staff or ...did he know and is he pizza clan?) Alexanders chief of staff used to work for congresswomen Marsha Blackburn now proposed to take corkers place . (so is she already compromosed pizza clan?) Former Sen Frist waswealthynot becuaseuewas ""a doctor"" bit bexuase his dad started the largest for profit hospital chain in the wolrd. That chain waslater found guilty of theargest fraud ever perpetrated inue usa. The chief executive when they did the fraud is Rick Scoot now the Governor of Floroda So there are just a lot of worrisome things about the tn republican party. A long history of swamp like false fronts, and worrispme evidence of possible balckmail and big business interests. I dont think TN is differnet than most official politcal party insiders. I think scrutiny would find theyre all controlled or compromised swamp which is why they are allowed to rise. Remember republican Dennis Hastret (a different state) was Speaker of the House and was a homosexual pedofile. Democrat barney frank had his boyfreind running a gay escort serviceout of his appartment. All this is why i think its good to replace all democrat and republican representives with people who have never bee active in the parties before. I think there is lots of reason to beleive no one rises in either party ranks unless they are compromised and turned swamp. We really need regular people like truck drivers and mid level office workers and things to represent us in congress. They would do better. Another case. Of course the currnet governor of tn is a republican named haslam. His father jim haslam started pilot oil. His brother jim haslam jr runs pilot oil now. Pilot oil was bustedby the FBI for a huge gasoline fraud scheme. Jim haslam jr also owns a nfl football team which in my opinion is a closed club they dont let you into unless you play along. There is another issue that may be related. Thatis that congressional staffers are over whelming gay and undermine those who dont have their agenda. And while its fine if a few percentage of congressional staffers are gay mirroring the population, its a problem if they dominate congress like tuey dominate hollywood and tue fsshion industry beciase their agenda is generally opposed to most of the agenda of the other 90% of americans on many major issues. The other issue is that classically being secretly gay has been oke of the main ways people have been blackmailed...especiallyif they have been living their lives as a heterosexual family man. For a long time you couldnt get a security clearance if you were gay because intelligence agencies knew it was a huge vulnerability and method of blackmail control.

31,vulnerability,The_Donald,The Atlantic Council Needs to Stop Meddling in Our Elections,30,75ma6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/75ma6u/the_atlantic_council_needs_to_stop_meddling_in/,2017-10-11 13:57:37,"SAN FRANCISCO  A bipartisan group of federal election officials, national security advisors and a retired U.S. general have formed a coalition to fight election hacking with the aim of establishing protocols that would keep Russians and other state entities from interfering with the voting process. At a Tuesday news conference at the headquarters of the foreign policy think-tank Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., the group plans to announce it's working on a list of necessary procedures and standards that state and local election officials must do, such as implementing digital firewalls around election data and making sure there are paper ballots to allow for auditing of all election tallies. It has given itself a 60-day deadline to produce the guidelines. The group also plans to pressure Congress to fund the election officials' activities ""because if the states and local election officials have one gripe we have to concede to them, its that theyre broke,"" said Jake Braun, a former senior consultant on cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama Administration who is helping organize the coalition. ""If we have a nation state attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, then its the federal governments job to pay for the defensive response."" The goal is to have the strongest, most unhackable system possible in place by the 2020 presidential election, he said. Concerns over foreign interference in last year's presidential election were heightened by last month's Department of Homeland Security announcement that election systems in 21 states had been targeted by Russian government hackers during the 2016 election campaign. It's ringing alarm bells, said Frederick Kempe, chief executive officer of the Atlantic Council, which is leading the effort. If we want to defend our democracy, then we need to protect our elections, he said. In July, hackers at the DefCon cybersecurity conference were able to break into five voting machine types in less than a day, underscoring the vulnerability of the U.S. election system. The group also plans to release a report on how the hackers were able to so swiftly hack the machines, a feat that raised red flags because the industry that operates voting systems had always said they were more protected from intrusions because they required such specialized knowledge to run. The voting machine hacks destroyed that argument, said Jeff Moss, president of DefCon and a commissioner on the The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine. It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) The Atlantic Council is chaired by Jon Huntsman, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Russia. In his statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month during his nomination hearing, he said there was no question that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year and that he would ""not hesitate to remind government officials that they are accountable for their actions."" Russia has consistently denied any interference in the U.S. election. Also in the coalition is the Center of Internet Security, a non-governmental organization that is funded by the Department of Homeland Security to fund cybersecurity for states and cities. While Russian attempts to insert itself into the U.S. political process were a surprise here, they were not news to those who have worked in the military and diplomatic corps. Many of our European allies have already seen this  years of Russian interference and Russian attempts to erode the credibility of the political process in Central and Eastern Europe, said Ambassador Douglas Lute, a retired three-star general who served under both Obama and George W. Bush and was most recently the former United States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council, NATOs standing political body. He's part of the coalition. And if what Russia did in 2016 was bad, what it might do in 2018 or 2020 with the knowledge it gained the first time around is worse, Lute said. By law, states must maintain statewide voter registration databases, many of which were probed in 2016. You can imagine a hacker could get into these databases, then do something as simple as misspelling names or transposing numbers in the address. Then when the voter goes to the polling place and shows his ID, he doesnt even get a ballot, Lute said.

I feel like I have a good grasp regarding the DNC ""hacks"", but would like to crowdsource this to see if we can get everything in order. **How it's portrayed by the MSM** Russia hacked the DNC and released DNC emails. This is confirmed by 17 intelligence communities who reviewed the evidence and came to that conclusion. **What We know** We know that the DNC said they were hacked. However, despite being a victim of a crime no single government agency has reviewed the DNC Servers, but a single private company, Crowdstrike, did. URL (maybe we should use the left's own sources so they can see how cucked they are?) In that same citation, it states that the FBI relied on Crowdstrike's report. Crowdstrike, the only entity given access to DNC servers. Also, some more sources URL URL 17 intelligence agencies agreeing on Russian hacking is FAKE News. Listen to former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper's testimony. * 3 agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI) * Not all 17 intelligence agencies * Total of two dozen or so people involved URL James Clapper goes on to talk about how these people from 3 agencies found that the Russian government hacked the DNC Servers... but wait, how can they come to this conclusion if they didn't review the servers themselves - instead relying on Crowdstrike's report? To confirm that no government agency had access to DNC servers, let's refer to former Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson's recent testimony... The DNC, he continued, did not feel it needed DHS assistance at that time. He later added, I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there, and the response I got was, the FBI had spoken to them, they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike. **So What About the CrowdStrike Report?** We have Jeffrey Carr, an expert in the field in cybersecurity writing an article calling the report ""a work of fiction"" URL And here is another article from Carr who proceeds to destroy the report and the DNC's narrative... ""Problem #1: The IP address 176.31.112[.]10 used in the Bundestag breach as a Command and Control server has never been connected to the Russian intelligence services. In fact, Claudio Guarnieri, a highly regarded security researcher, whose technical analysis was referenced by Rid, stated that no evidence allows to tie the attacks to governments of any particular country. "" ""Problem #2: The Command &amp; Control server (176.31.112.10) was using an outdated version of OpenSSL vulnerable to Heartbleed attacks. Heartbleed allows attackers to exfiltrate data including private keys, usernames, passwords and other sensitive information. The existence of a known security vulnerability thats trivial to exploit opens the door to the possibility that the systems in question were used by one rogue group, and then infiltrated by a second rogue group, making the attribution process even more complicated. At the very least, the C2 server should be considered a compromised indicator."" ""Problem #3: The BfV published a newsletter in January 2016 which assumes that the GRU and FSB are responsible because of technical indicators, not because of any classified finding; to wit: Many of these attack campaigns have each other on technical similarities, such as malicious software families, and infrastructure  these are important indicators of the same authorship. It is assumed that both the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB and the military foreign intelligence service GRU run cyber operations. Professor Rids argument depended heavily on conveying hard attribution by the BfV even though the President of the BfV didnt disguise the fact that their attribution was based on an assumption and not hard evidence. When it came to attributing Fancy Bear to the GRU, Dmitry Alperovich used a type of estimative language because there was no hard proof: Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation with    (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU, Russias premier military intelligence service. URL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, let's sum this up and feel free to add to this with more sources, please! 1. No single government agency ever reviewed the DNC servers despite the DNC claiming they were a victim of a crime. 2. Jeh Johnson and the FBI understood that the DNC was going to with Crowdstrike to review the servers 3. The Intelligence community consisted of a 'couple dozen or so' people from **3** agencies, not 17. 4. These 3 agencies used Crowdstrike's report as the basis of their evidence 5. Crowdstrike's report doesn't even stand up to the smallest bit of scrutiny. What's even better is Crowdstrike's connection to the White House and Hillary Clinton..I didn't touch on that, but there is a lot of substance there. So, the left's narrative of the DNC being hacked by Russia is nothing more than a conspiracy theory "
35,vulnerability,The_Donald,"There's got to be a way to destroy Facebook, and take away Zuckerberg's leverage for 2020. I've been brain-storming some ideas. If you have some ideas, let's hear 'em!",14,6k17a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6k17a5/theres_got_to_be_a_way_to_destroy_facebook_and/,2017-06-29 01:17:14,"Here's an idea: Make a website where people can give their facebook login and pw, and the website posts on your behalf, spamming your facebook friends with advertisements to do the same. If enough people do it, the facebook news feed will be all junk. Facebook will try to censor these posts, but we can change the posts faster than facebook can take them down. Another feature of the website is it goes through your friends list and asks you which friends you actually care about, and it helps you keep in touch with only those friends. So rather than visiting facebook every day, you visit the new website which gives you a filtered news feed which it skimmed off of your facebook news feed. This way, you don't miss anything important that's happening on facebook. You can still interact with core friends, and you miss nothing, and you don't have to sift through yesterday's Reddit cat videos to do it either. Another thing the website can do is clean up your facebook privacy settings. Giving away your facebook login and pw may seem like you're losing privacy, but in reality, you've already given all this personal information to facebook, so how could it be worse? In fact, this new website can make you more private, by knowing all the facebook privacy nuances, and changing your settings for you to make you as private as possible. As more of your friends also join this website, you can gradually interact directly through this website, and facebook can gradually become irrelevant. The mistake Google+ made was not doing this. No one wants to jump to a new social platform, and end up all alone waiting for others to join them. That's why the new platform has to interface with facebook on your behalf. If this idea works, we could turn facebook into the next myspace. Facebook crushed myspace because myspace was so full of nonsense, it was refreshing to have a clean, simple interface. But now facebook has grown to have a lot of bloatware of its own. So much of your facebook newsfeed is full of funny videos your friends may have liked, and now it's just another youtube/reddit/break, etc... The percentage of personal posts on facebook is way down from where it used to be. It's not simple and personal any more. That's its biggest vulnerability. Anyway, think of how awesome it would be to take down facebook, and wipe that grin off of Zuckerberg's face, and make him look like a loser heading into 2020. Getting rich doing it would be icing on the cake!"

Anybody noticing this?",238,6ls29p,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6ls29p/narrative_shift_many_of_us_say_antiislam_msm_now/,2017-07-07 17:11:22,"I've noticed this semantic shift recently. I say I'm ""anti-Islam"" because I'm against the ideology. I am not against Muslims. They are just people who have ideas that I want to challenge and change by advancing what I perceive to be better ideas. Minds can be changed. Hearts can be won. I don't want to see Islam spread further in the world. I want it to recede. I don't consider it to be bigoted or racist to be against a belief system, so I'm comfortable saying this. Come at me, NN. Our adversaries sneer ""Islamophobes!"" But we retort with ""Yeah, there IS some scary shit about Islam,"" and Islam unfortunately keeps proving us right. So I think they are rebranding. For one, their constant repetition of the word ""Islamophobia"" ties the ideas of Islam and phobia together. It means that any time they want to attack us they have to keep associating Islam and fear, Islam and fear, Islam and fear, over and over. Not good branding. Beyond that, they know we are right that there is nothing wrong with challenging ideas. So what's their solution? By framing us as ""anti-Muslim"" instead, they drop the baggage of ""Islamophobia"" AND create a strong counter to ""anti-Islam"". Because suddenly it is no longer about ideas. ""Anti-Muslim"" makes it personal. They've brought it down to the individual level. It creates a sensation of vulnerability. They want all of the thoughts of beheadings, terrorist attacks, and screams of ""Death to America! Allahu Akbar!"" to vanish and be replaced by a single image of a lone Muslim woman in a hijab. Can you picture her? Is it like she's standing in front of you staring back at you? They need to paint their victim in peoples' minds ao that they can paint us as oppressors. How do we push back against this? The sardonic side of me almost wonders if we should adopt the phrase ""Islamophobia""."
37,vulnerability,The_Donald,Academia and the methodology of state sponsored liberal indoctrination of our children,23,6ncivu,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6ncivu/academia_and_the_methodology_of_state_sponsored/,2017-07-15 08:58:09,"Most people going to college are stupid teens whose brain isn't even developed. They are feeling the pressure of their entire lives ahead of them and don't know what to do, they are isolated and looking for something or someone to give them guidance. They are unsure of themselves and often lack confidence. Now here comes the leftists who use cult indoctrination tactics, often with the academia's faculty aiding them, pushing a narrative on them. Of course these people are spending tens of thousands of dollars, and this is often their first time away from home so they don't want to make trouble for their parents less they feel like a failure or burden, so they feel like they have to go along to get along. This is the most disgusting part of academia, how the administration aids these groups by punishing those who don't accept the narrative and even expelling students who anger SJW groups on campus. Now let's go over the methods of indoctrination and see if you can spot what goes on every day with leftists on college campuses. Methods of indoctrination: 1) HYPNOSIS - Inducing a high state of suggestibility, often thinly disguised as relaxation or meditation a. Repetitive Music (most likely with a beat close to the human heart 45 to 72 beats per minute). Most likely used during ""study sessions"" as the teacher will say the music helps you relax and concentrate better! b. Voice Roll -- A ""voice roll"" is a patterned, paced style used by hypnotists when inducing a trance. It is also used by many lawyers, several of whom are highly trained hypnotists, when they desire to entrench a point firmly in the minds of the jurors. A voice roll can sound as if the speaker were talking to the beat of a metronome or it may sound as though he were emphasizing every word in a monotonous, patterned style. The words will usually be delivered at the rate of 45 to 60 beats per minute, maximizing the hypnotic effect. c. Room ""Feel"" - The way a room feels is essential to hypnotizing unknowing subjects. It needs special lighting, florescent lights are best because they aren't too dim, but aren't too harsh. Also, Room Temp helps a bit, usually a little cooler than normal room temperature. You need to have the unknowing subjects very relaxed, perhaps even close to falling asleep. 2) PEER GROUP PRESSURE - Suppressing doubt and resistance to new ideas by exploiting the need to belong. 3) ""LOVE BOMBING"" - Creating a sense of family through physical touch, thought &amp; feeling sharing and emotional bonding. 4) REJECTION OF OLD VALUES - Accelerating acceptance of new lifestyle by constantly denouncing former beliefs and values. 5) CONFUSING DOCTRINE - Encouraging blind acceptance and rejection of logic through complex lectures on an incomprehensible doctrine. 6) METACOMMUNICATION - Implanting subliminal messages by stressing certain key words or phrases in long, confusing lectures. 7) REMOVAL OF PRIVACY - Achieving loss of ability to evaluate logically by preventing private contemplation. 8) DISINHIBITION - Encouraging child-like obedience by orchestrating child-like behaviour 9) UNCOMPROMISING RULES - Inducing regression and disorientation by soliciting agreement to seemingly simple rules which regulate mealtimes, bathroom breaks and use of medications. 10) VERBAL ABUSE - Desensitizing through bombardment with foul and abusive language. (Physical abuse, such as torture, is the more extreme form of this.) 11) SLEEP DEPRIVATION AND FATIGUE - Creating disorientation and vulnerability by prolonging mental an physical activity and withholding adequate rest and sleep. 12) DRESS CODES - Removing individuality by demanding conformity to the group dress code. 13) CHANTING OR SINGING - Eliminating non-cult ideas through group repetition of mind-narrowing chants or phrases. 14) CONFESSION - Encouraging the destruction of individual ego through confession of personal weaknesses and innermost feelings of doubt. 15) FINANCIAL COMMITMENT - Achieving increased dependence on the group by 'burning bridges' to the past, through the donation of assets. 16) FINGER POINTING - Creating a false sense of righteousness by pointing to the shortcomings of the outside world. 17) ISOLATION - Inducing loss of reality by physical separation from family, friends, society and rational references. 18) CONTROLLED APPROVAL - Maintaining vulnerability and confusion by alternately rewarding and punishing similar actions. 19) CHANGE OF DIET - Creating disorientation and increased susceptibility to emotional arousal by depriving the nervous system of necessary nutrients through the use of special diets and/or fasting. Also applying drugs for these purposes fall in this category. 20) GAMES - Inducing dependence on the group by introducing games with obscure rules. 21) NO QUESTIONS - Accomplishing automatic acceptance of beliefs by discouraging questions. 22) GUILT - Reinforcing the need for 'salvation' by exaggerating the sins of the former lifestyles. 23) FEAR - Maintaining loyalty and obedience to the group by threatening soul, life or limb for the slightest 'negative' thought, word or deed. Three Principles of Re-Education 1) REPETITION - Going through the same subject over and over again until it is known by heart. 2) ACTIVITY PEDAGOGICS - The subjects are never left alone nor give any private time of their own, they are always in activity. 3) CRITICISM AND SELF-CRITICISM - The subjects are supposed to feel uncertain; under the constant threat of being humiliated and despised. Through these scientifically proven methods, and with enough time, anyone can be broken down. These college campuses are not about education, they are factories churning out footsoldiers for the establishment and the left. This is why college student support of Hillary Clinton was so high yet no student could actually name a single thing Hillary has done to warrant support and even were able to be trolled with supporting quotes from Donald Trump when they thought Hillary Clinton said them. They are literally brainwashed into thinking whatever the left puts out is good even if it is directly contradicting something they supported moments before. This mentality conflicting with reality often breeds [mental illness which results in violence and a loss of self identity and worth.](URL"

Comey's response was that the two issues were separate. This, I feel, raises more questions. Wouldn't it makes sense from a counterintelligence standpoint to investigate the side that was already breached given that they could be blackmailed? After all at that point it was widely perceived that Clinton would win. Surely this was a more serious threat. The FBI was also aware that Abedin's computer communicated with Wiener's which contained evidence of his pedophilia. The arrangment between these devices reveals an exploitable vulnerability which sophisticated Russian hackers could penetrate. This is classic material to blackmail someone with. And after that why would the FBI rely on a third-party assessment by an organization founded by a Russian national to base their conclusion upon? Something smells about this. I am convinced that it was Comey trying to blackmail Trump not the other way around. Comey leaked the memos. Comey ended the investigation. Comey set up the 1v1 w/ Trump and leaked it to CNN. Comey knew Sessions would recuse himself before it happened because his leaks would prompt it. And we will soon find out that Comey leaked Flynn communications. The only person, by a process of elimination who would have all this information is Comey. That is why the only thing that didn't leak is Trump wasn't under investigation. That is also why the leaker hasn't been found because it was Comey's job to find him."

Something odd and suspicious is going on here. I've observed users get brigaded like crazy by SJWs on sports subs for criticizing frickin' TV COMMERCIALS. I've seen people get called Nazis and white supremacists - simply for supporting law enforcement - by hordes of shills who miraculously appear within like literally a few seconds of the original comment. I've ALSO seen massive ad hominem attacks on users who were trying to defend women's honor but were called patriarchs and misogynists who hate women. It's like you're SUPPOSED to ONLY talk about women as brave warriors and soldiers and never even hint at women's vulnerability. Now, the common and suspicious elements in all this are: - the EXTREME SPEED with which the SJWs suddenly all miraculously gather to target the user. It happens literally within SECONDS. - the INTENSITY OF THE BITTERNESS, RAGE AND HATE of their replies for a very minor transgression, EVEN IF you can even call it a transgression. KEEP IN MIND these are people calling you **worthless, crazy, disgusting, evil, stupid** etc when you're NOT using racial slurs/racist language/misogynist slurs/misogynist language. - the NUMBER of the opposing group members. Some guy criticizes a dumb TV commercial and 20 people will show up to call him misogynist. Another guy tries to defend a woman's honor on some other subreddit in some thread buried deep in the comments. Suddenly 50 SJWs will show up to call him a disgusting, weirdo who hates women's independence and freedom. Say something deep in a thread supporting cops. SUDDENLY, you've got 30 people after you right after you hit 'submit'. - VERY RIGID ENFORCEMENT OF RULES OF SPEECH ON CERTAIN TOPICS: These people are very very very clear that they ONLY want you to say certain things. It does not matter if you refrain from using racist/misogynist/ethnic slurs. That's not enough. You have to go way further than that. You should simply NOT criticize ANYTHING that has to do even remotely with women or minorities or ESPECIALLY transgenders. They're very particular about that. - ENFORCEMENT OF A BELIEF SYSTEM: You should either shut up OR you should ONLY speak of women as strong, tough, invulnerable human beings who are equal to men in every respect including physically. You should either shut up or only adhere to strict codes about pronoun use. You should either shut up or never say one word in support of law enforcement. My conclusion is that these people in conjunction with Reddit admins and execs have large-scale virtual/software tools that enable them in real time to analyze semantic patterns from hundreds of users in many subreddits. And then target certain people based on what they say. They then communicate rapidly with their minions and assign them the target for them to launch their vicious and cruel ad hominem attacks. "

How many nations are suffering from Islamic infiltration? One? A handful? Nearly every nation? The Islamic leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood and others wish to dissolve each nations sovereignty and replace it with the global imposition of Islamic sharia law. Sharia law, based on the koran, sira and hadith, condemns liberty and forbids equality and is inconsistent with the laws of all Western nations. As the author and historian Serge Trifkovic states: &amp;nbsp; *The refusal of the Western elite class to protect their nations from jihadist infiltration is the biggest betrayal in history.* &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; **STAGE 2: CONSOLIDATION OF POWER** Muslim immigrants and host country converts continue demands for accommodation in employment, education, social services, financing and courts. * Proselytizing increases; Establishment and Recruitment of Jihadi cells. * Efforts to convert alienated segments of the population to Islam. * Revisionist efforts to Islamize history. * Efforts to destroy historic evidence that reveal true Islamism. * Increased anti-western propaganda and psychological warfare. * Efforts to recruit allies who share similar goals (communists, anarchists). * Attempts to indoctrinate children to Islamist viewpoint. * Increased efforts to intimidate, silence and eliminate non-Muslims. * Efforts to introduce blasphemy and hate laws in order to silence critics. * Continued focus on enlarging Muslim population by increasing Muslim births and immigration. * Use of charities to recruit supporters and fund jihad. * Covert efforts to bring about the destruction of host society from within. * Development of Muslim political base in non-Muslim host society. * Islamic Financial networks fund political growth, acquisition of land. * Highly visible assassination of critics aimed to intimidate opposition. * Tolerance of non-Muslims diminishes. * Greater demands to adopt strict Islamic conduct. * Clandestine amassing of weapons and explosives in hidden locations. * Overt disregard/rejection of non-Muslim societys legal system, culture. * Efforts to undermine and destroy power base of non-Muslim religions including and especially Jews and Christians. Is there a pattern here? Theo van Gogh is murdered in the Netherlands for insulting Islam; the Organization of the Islamic Conference demands anti-blasphemy laws through the United Nations; France is set afire regularly by youths (read Muslims); the rise of (dis-) honor killingsholocaust denialanti-Semitismdeception re the tenets of Islam; hatred toward Christians and Jews and Hindus and Buddhists. The pattern for all to see is the rise of Islamic intolerance and the covert/cultural jihad to remake host societies into sharia-compliant worlds  to remove host sovereignty and replace it with Islamic sharia law. Sharia law that condemns earthly liberty and individual freedom, that forbids equality among faiths and between the sexes, that rejects the concept of nations outside the global house of Islam, that of dar al-Islam. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; **STAGE 3: OPEN WAR w/ LEADERSHIP &amp; CULTURE** Open violence to impose Sharia law and associated cultural restrictions; rejection of host government, subjugation of other religions and customs. * Intentional efforts to undermine the host government &amp; culture. * Acts of barbarity to intimidate citizens and foster fear and submission. * Open and covert efforts to cause economic collapse of the society. * All opposition is challenged and either eradicated or silenced. * Mass execution of non-Muslims. * Widespread ethnic cleansing by Islamic militias. * Rejection and defiance of host society secular laws or culture. * Murder of moderate Muslim intellectuals who dont support Islamization. * Destruction of churches, synagogues and other non-Muslim institutions. * Women are restricted further in accordance with Sharia law. * Large-scale destruction of population, assassinations, bombings. * Toppling of government and usurpation of political power. * Imposition of Sharia law The website URL keeps track of the number of violent jihad attacks as best it can. The site lists more than 14,000 attacks since September 2001. It is worth a visit. What is occurring, however, that is likely inestimable are events where muslims are bullied by other muslims for not being muslim enough, where non-Muslims are intimidated into doing or not doing what they desire, where remnant populations are in a death spiral simply for being non-muslim in a predominantly muslim area. Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists Animists and Atheists meet with death, property destruction or confiscation, forced conversion, rape, excessive taxation (the jizya), enslavement, riotous mobs and various other forms of islam (in-) justice at the hands of muslims in Sudan, Philippines, Kenya, Malaysia, India, etc. And let us not forget death to Apostates the world over. &amp;nbsp; --- &amp;nbsp; **STAGE 4: Totalitarian ISLAMIC THEOCRACY** Islam becomes the only religious-political-judicial-cultural ideology. * Sharia becomes the law of the land. * All non-Islamic human rights cancelled. * Enslavement and genocide of non-Muslim population. * Freedom of speech and the press eradicated. * All religions other than Islam are forbidden and destroyed. * Destruction of all evidence of non-Muslim culture, populations and symbols in country (Buddhas, houses of worship, art, etc). The House of Islam (peace), dar al-Islam, includes those nations that have submitted to Islamic rule, to the soul crushing, liberty-condemning, discriminatory law of Sharia. The rest of the world in in the House of War, dar al-harb, because it does not submit to Sharia, and exists in a state of rebellion or war with the will of Allah. No non-Muslim state or its citizens are innocent, and remain viable targets of war for not believing in Allah. The Christian, Jewish, Coptic, Hindu and Zoroastrian peoples of world have suffered under subjugation for centuries. The Dhimmi-esque are forbidden to construct houses of worship or repair existing ones, economically crippled by the heavy jizya (tax), socially humiliated, legally discriminated against, criminally targeted and generally kept in a permanent state of weakness, fear and vulnerability by Islamic governments. It should be noted that forced conversions (Egypt) and slavery (Sudan) are still reported. Homosexuals have been hung in the public square in Iran. Young girls are married to old men. Apostates are threatened with death. Honor killings are routine. Women are legally second-class citizens, though Muslim males insist they are treated better than in the West. These more obvious manifestations may distract from some less obvious ones such as the lack of intellectual inquiry in science, narrow scope of writing, all but non-existent art and music, sexual use and abuse of youth and women, and the disregard for personal fulfillment, joy and wonder. Look into the eyes of a recently married 12 year old girl to see the consequence of the moral deprivation spawned by Islam."

This political nexus was spotted by Jane Mayer of The New Yorker in a recent blog post. She noted that the dominoes began to fall when a self-appointed FBI whistleblower went to Republican members of Congress, first Rep. Dave Reichert of Washington state and then House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, to warn them of a possible coverup of an investigation of CIA Director David Petraeus. Cantor's staff called the office of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III, and the fat was in the fire.

The Wall Street Journal first reported on Monday night that the agent had been barred from the case. Later, the agent became convinced  incorrectly, the official said  that the case had stalled. Because of his ""worldview,"" as the official put it, he suspected a politically motivated cover-up to protect President Obama.

This is a strange way to explain his contact with the F.B.I. on this matter, because it is almost inconceivable that director Mueller was not already aware that the bureau he runs had examined the e-mail account of the director of the C.I.A., and, further, confronted him in person. Such a meeting between the bureau and head of the C.I.A. would have been extraordinary, and it is fairly unthinkable that Mueller wouldn't have been consulted. So what information was Cantor conveying when he got in touch with Mueller? One obvious point of the call would have been to inform the F.B.I. director that Republicans on the Hill knew about Petraeus's vulnerability, and also about the investigation. If the F.B.I. had ever entertained hopes of keeping it secret, the odds of doing so were fast diminishing. The same message would have become clear to Petraeus, who was due to testify in front of a House panel next week. If Cantor spoke with Mueller on Halloween, as the Times chronology suggests, what happened between then and November 6th, which is when the F.B.I. reportedly informed James Clapper Jr., the Director of National Intelligence, about Petraeus's extra-marital affair? The internal pressure must have been enormous on Petraeus during this period. Perhaps he tried to outlast the election in order to shelter Obama from the fallout of his own personal foibles. Perhaps the F.B.I. director, Mueller, who has a reputation for integrity, tried to keep the scandal from political exploitation by keeping it under wraps until Election Day. Cantor, too, appears to have kept quiet, despite the political advantage his party might have gained from going public. Why?

Your decision to release Megrahi causes me to abandon that practice in this case.

Your action in releasing Megrahi is as inexplicable as it is detrimental to the cause of justice. Indeed your action makes a mockery of the rule of law.

Your action rewards a terrorist even though he never admitted to his role in this act of mass murder and even though neither he nor the government of Libya ever disclosed the names and roles of others who were responsible. Your action makes a mockery of the emotions, passions and pathos of all those affected by the Lockerbie tragedy: the medical personnel who first faced the horror of 270 bodies strewn in the fields around Lockerbie, and in the town of Lockerbie itself; the hundreds of volunteers who walked the fields of Lockerbie to retrieve any piece of debris related to the break- up of the plane; the hundreds of FBI agents and Scottish police who undertook an unprecedented global investigation to identify those responsible; the prosecutors who worked for years--in some cases a full career--to see justice done.

You apparently made this decision without regard to the views of your partners in the investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the Lockerbie tragedy.

You have given the family members of those who died continued grief and frus- tration. You have given those who sought to assure that the persons responsible would be held accountable the back of your hand. You have given Megrahi a ""jubilant welcome"" in Tripoli, according to the reporting. Where, I ask, is the justice? Sincerely yours, Robert S.

45,vulnerability,The_Donald,Taqiyya/Kitman - Lying to advance Islamic conquest.,25,5v2gzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5v2gzb/taqiyyakitman_lying_to_advance_islamic_conquest/,2017-02-20 15:03:28,"URL Does Islam permit Muslims to lie? Muslim scholars teach that Muslims should generally be truthful to each other, unless the purpose of lying is to ""smooth over differences."" There are several forms of lying to non-believers that are permitted under certain circumstances, the best known being taqiyya. These circumstances are typically those that advance the cause of Islam - in some cases by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them. Muslims are allowed to lie to unbelievers in order to defeat them. There are two forms: Taqiyya - Saying something that isn't true as it relates to the Muslim identity. Kitman - Lying by omission. An example would be when Muslim apologists quote only a fragment of verse 5:32 (that if anyone kills ""it shall be as if he had killed all mankind"") while neglecting to mention that the rest of the verse (and the next) mandate murder in undefined cases of ""corruption"" and ""mischief."" Tawriya - Intentionally creating a false impression. Muruna - 'Blending in' by setting aside some practices of Islam or Sharia in order to advance others. Though not called Taqiyya by name, Muhammad clearly used deception when he signed a 10-year treaty with the Meccans that allowed him access to their city while he secretly prepared his own forces for a takeover. The unsuspecting residents were conquered in easy fashion after he broke the treaty two years later. Some of the people in the city who had trusted him at his word were executed. Another example of lying is when Muhammad used deception to trick his personal enemies into letting down their guard and exposing themselves to slaughter by pretending to seek peace. This happened in the case of Ka'b bin al-Ashraf (as previously noted) and again later against Usayr ibn Zarim, a surviving leader of the Banu Nadir tribe, which had been evicted from their home in Medina by the Muslims. At the time, Usayr ibn Zarim was attempting to gather an armed force against the Muslims from among a tribe allied with the Quraish (against which Muhammad had already declared war). Muhammad's ""emissaries"" went to ibn Zarim and persuaded him to leave his safe haven on the pretext of meeting with the prophet of Islam in Medina to discuss peace. Once vulnerable, the leader and his thirty companions were massacred by the Muslims with ease, probably because they were unarmed, having been given a guarantee of safe passage (Ibn Ishaq 981). Such was the reputation of Muslims for lying and then killing that even those who ""accepted Islam"" did not feel entirely safe. Consider the fate of the Jadhima. When Muslim ""missionaries"" approached their tribe, one of the members insisted that they would be slaughtered even though they had already ""converted"" to Islam to avoid just such a demise. However, the others believed they could trust the Muslim leader's promise that they would not be harmed if they simply offered no resistance. (After convincing the skeptic to lay down his arms, the unarmed men of the tribe were quickly tied up and beheaded - Ibn Ishaq 834 &amp; 837). Today's Muslims often rationalize Muhammad's murder of poets and others who criticized him at Medina by falsely claiming that they broke a treaty with their actions. Yet, these same apologists place little value on treaties broken by Muslims. From Muhammad to Saddam Hussein, promises made to non-Muslim are distinctly non-binding in the Muslim mindset. Leaders in the Arab world sometimes say one thing to English-speaking audiences and then say something entirely different to their own people in Arabic. Yassir Arafat was famous for telling Western newspapers about his desire for peace with Israel, then turning right around and whipping Palestinians into a hateful and violent frenzy against Jews. The 9/11 hijackers practiced deception by going into bars and drinking alcohol, thus throwing off potential suspicion that they were fundamentalists plotting jihad. This effort worked so well that John Walsh, the host of a popular American television show, claimed well after the fact that their bar trips were evidence of 'hypocrisy.' The transmission from Flight 93 records the hijackers telling their doomed passengers that there is ""a bomb on board"" but that everyone will ""be safe"" as long as ""their demands are met."" Obviously none of these things were true, but these men, who were so intensely devoted to Islam that they were willing to ""slay and be slain for the cause of Allah"" (as the Quran puts it) saw nothing wrong with employing Taqiyya to facilitate their mission of mass murder. The Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) insists that it ""has not now or ever been involved with the Muslim Brotherhood, or supported any covert, illegal, or terrorist activity or organization."" In fact, it was created by the Muslim Brotherhood and has bankrolled Hamas. At least nine founders or board members of ISNA have been accused by prosecutors of supporting terrorism. The notorious Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) is so well known for shamelessly lying about its ties to terror and extremism that books have been written on the subject. They take seriously the part of Sharia that says ""it is permissible to lie if attaining the goal is permissible and obligatory to lie if the goal is obligatory"". The goal being the ascendency of Islam (and Sharia itself) on the American landscape. Prior to engineering several deadly terror plots, such as the Fort Hood massacre and the attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner, American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was regularly sought out by NPR, PBS and even government leaders to expound on the peaceful nature of Islam. In 2013, a scholar the prestigious al-Azhar university decreed that Muslims may wear the cross in order to deceive Christians into thinking they are friendly. He cited 3:28 which says not to be friends with non-Muslims unless it is a way of ""guarding"" yourself against them. The Quran says in several places that Allah is the best at deceiving people. An interesting side note is verse 7:99, which says that the only people who feel secure from Allah are those destined for Hell. Taken literally, this could mean that Muslims who arrogantly assume that they will enter heaven are in for a rude surprise (such are the hazards of worshipping an all-powerful deceiver). The near absence of Quranic verses and reliable Hadith that encourage truthfulness is somewhat surprising, given that many Muslims are convinced that their religion teaches honesty. In fact, many Muslims are honest because of this. But when lying is addressed in the Quran, it is nearly always in reference to the ""lies against Allah"" - referring to the Jews and Christians who rejected Muhammad's claim to being a prophet. Finally, the circumstances by which Muhammad allowed a believer to lie to a non-spouse are limited to those that either advance the cause of Islam or enable a Muslim to avoid harm to his well-being (and presumably that of other Muslims as well). Although this should be kept very much in mind when dealing with matters of global security, such as Iran's nuclear intentions, it is not grounds for assuming that the Muslim one might personally encounter on the street or in the workplace is any less honest than anyone else."
46,vulnerability,The_Donald,"My thoughts on Milo regarding his ""pedo"" accusation and how it relates to the Globalist agenda",13,5v99xw,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5v99xw/my_thoughts_on_milo_regarding_his_pedo_accusation/,2017-02-21 14:25:26,"TL;DR: Milo might be controlled opposition and was ""sacrificed"" to fuel emotional outrage and negative energy to be used as a psychic sniper rifle to take out their real threat, Daddy Trump. But it will have the side affect of dropping pedophilia into the public consciousness and we will KEEP ON WINNING. MY THOUGHTS BELOW: News going around today that Milo Yiannopoulos was on video defending pedophilia, then his invitation to CPAC was revoked and his book deal was canceled. Pretty convenient timing and I believe there's something fishy going on. Here's my take: They knew about his pedo comments for a long time (I saw the video months ago) and waited until now to use them in a smear campaign to take down another major influencer that isn't going along with their agenda. They wanted to censor him or take him down ""for good"" by labeling him a pedo and getting him kicked out of conservative or alt-right circles. Just like how the Corporate Media tried to take down the biggest YouTuber Pewdiepie by taking nazi jokes out of context to paint him as an antisemite with the goal of fueling mass-outrage and more negative energy. They then parlayed this outrage while it was still hot onto their real threat Donald Trump, after he made some awkward comments to an orthodox Jew in his press conference. They cried ""antisemitism"" and tried to put that label onto Trump - all to generate more mass outrage and calls for his impeachment. But it backfired again and Pewdiepie's 55 million followers came to his defense and started calling bullshit and censorship. They now hate the Corporate Media even more and are aware of how they lie and deliberately use their power to smear people who are a threat to them. Back to Milo... My assertion is, like Pewdiepie last week, they were hoping that Milo's fans would defend him while defending pedophilia (or more accurately Ephebophilia - adult/teenager). They would argue that he shouldn't be labeled a pedo because it ""wasn't that bad"" or ""not real pedophilia."" This way it takes the heat off all the ACTUAL pedophiles in government (both Dems and Republicans) who Donald Trump knows about and plans on exposing (along with the Shadow Government aka Deep State). They were hoping that there would be a cry to argue that sex with a teenage boy is not a crime. Then use that public outcry to justify their OWN pedophile crimes when they come to light. They (Globalist Elites) use the Left/Right political dynamic to divide and conquer the people and get them to fight each other like rival gangs. In my view, they have a major influence in creating the extremists on both sides of this divide. You have ANTIFA and SJWs vs White Nationalists and Neo-Nazis. Or so they'd like you to believe. In my opinion, it's all a construction. Both sides have Truth in them somewhere, but they want you to pick a side and join the fight while ignoring the big picture. Anyway, I think Milo is actually part of this charade. That he is controlled opposition to the left. Here's why I think that: Milo has been growing in popularity, especially after the Berkeley riots tried to shut down his talk. Corporate media has been labeling him everything from an alt-right gateway drug to neo-nazi fascist, giving a bunch of disgruntled lefties permission to assault him and his supporters. Ok, their plan ""backfired"" and Milo's popularity soared and his defenders were more embolded. What actually ended up happening is the divide got bigger. People on the left hated him even more, and the people on the right were pushed even further right. But it also had the side affect of people waking up to the absurdity of this and it creates a bigger desire for Free Speech (and Freedom and Truth in general). Just last week Milo hits the mainstream media on Bill Mahr, giving his platform even more airtime in what was mostly a lightweight back and forth banter. The after-hours part of the show he ends up frustrating the other co-hosts to say things like, ""You're an American? (No) Fuck off!"" Which is ironic considering that Milo's an immigrant and this comment is apparently not ""xenophobic"" because Milo's on the opposing team. Milo is gay and a Jew and brags about his black boyfriends, (something he always brings up) to deflect any accusations of racism, homophobia, and xenophobia - some of the Left's biggest ""arguments"" - which were handed down by the Globalists as ""control words"" aka psyhic weapons, to create a sort of mind control and self-censorship. The same Globalist Elites who try to orchestrate the political divide and conquer strategy of chaos and civil war, which they will then offer their Solution once it gets bad enough. Don't fall for it. But Milo giggles off the insults and parlays it into more witty banter. Doesn't even seem to take it personally. Interesting. The fact that he doesn't seem to get affected makes me question if Milo isn't just a character. A character that is made-up and promoted to argue and trigger lefties and SJWs in some sort of theatrical political entertainment circus. The fact that this ""extremist"" has gotten a lot of corporate media attention and is a wonderful enemy for the left to project all their anger onto, is pretty convenient. He's like the quarterback of the other team. I've read elsewhere that they have dug up ""dirt"" on conservative influencers like Gavin McInnes, Ann Coulter, Lauren Southern, etc and are ready to pull those out when they need to try to off another chess piece. We'll see. I've often wondered how someone can be so resilient to criticism and attacks. And have the balls to be so cocky and troll the left without mercy or hesitation. Why does he not show any vulnerability? I started to think it means his personal ego isn't really at risk because he is part of some larger group or working for someone else. I know he's backed by Breitbart... which I wonder who pulls the strings behind the scenes for them? Just a thought. Like the Milgrim Experiment, people are more likely to give an electrical shock to another if an authority tells them to do it. It can override their conscience. Milo has no issue trolling people and stirring up emotional Lefties and he never seems to get his own feelings hurt. And his arguments tend to be void of empathy or compassion, but rather some well-rehearsed facts so he can ""win."" He is a brilliant debater and his SJW takedowns are fun to watch. But it makes him seem unhuman to me. If he's indeed part of some contrived turf war between rival gangs, it wouldn't surprise me. So then we get to Trump. This all comes down to associating this bad boy ""fascist"" and now ""pedo"" extremist with Donald Trump. Because Milo is a vocal supporter of ""Daddy Trump"" and was going to share a speaking stage with him at the upcoming CPAC event, they want to establish guilt by association. The headline of the David Brock's anti-trump astroturfing outfit Shareblue says, ""Milo defender Donald Trump was proudly announced to join the pedophilia advocate at CPAC"" - Wow, they are not fucking around by trying to get people to associate this mess with Trump. They will use the sexist comments made by Trump and this association with a tarnished Milo to paint him as equally bad. Guilty by association. This is supposed to give the fearful Globalists and Shadow Government more ammunition to oust Trump from the presidency. They will use this to emotionally manipulate people to hate Trump even more and call for his impeachment or even assassination. They already are, but they want it to get worse. They are stoking the fire and fanning the flames. Creating moral outrage is nothing new for the media, but it's used as a weapon. Stir up a lot of negative energy (fear, resentment, hatred) and then direct that outrage at the enemy. Like a psychic sniper rifle. Then when the public starts crying for a solution, you offer them the already produced solution that you've been wanting to implement the whole time. In this case, it's to get Trump the fuck out of the way so they can continue their gloablist one-world dystopia. They assume people are not hip to their game. They want Trump out so bad because he's NOT ONE OF THEM. Former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is on video saying that Trump hasn't taken any of the secret oaths and isn't part of their secret societies like Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, etc. He's not gone through ""the initiations"" like most of the people in power have. These includes child porn, pedophilia, satanic ritual abuse, and more insidious crimes that are videotaped and used as blackmail to control politicians. Many many people in government have some sort of criminal dirt on them that keeps them in their lane. If they veer too far out of their lane, they can be threatened and blackmailed. They are controlled via the power hierarchy and only know what they need to know to do their jobs. There are good people in government, yes, but they won't get too far unless they know how to play the game. If they blow the whistle or become too much of a threat, they might end up suicided with two gunshots in the back of the head. The Clinton's have so much nasty dirt on them it's insane. The Cliton Foundation is a front for all sorts of crimes we will come to learn about including child trafficking. Between Bill's 20+ trips to convicted pedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein's private island on his ""Lolita Express"" plane to John Podesta's leaked emails involving Hillary which started the ""PizzaGate"" scandal that provoked the corporate media to launch the ""fake news"" campaign. It's a mess. Trump, as crass and rude as he is, is not part of their club, and like I said before, he's already in the process of exposing this corruption and pedophilia that is rampant not only in the US government but worldwide. His first executive order was to take away the restrictions that were preventing law enforcement from investigating and prosecuting the human trafficking rings. So far there have been over 1,500 arrests across the country since he took office. They are rounding up the lower level traffickers first, and my guess is they hope it will lead to more evidence up the chain. This is also interesting because of the extreme amount of PROJECTION and guts it takes to call Milo a pedophile when THEY ARE PEDOPHILES themselves. They are drawing attention away from themselves by painting Milo as the bad guy. Granted, he does deserve to get knocked down a bit, but it's not even about him. Some people will continue to support Milo, he does speak some truth. But he's a chess piece in a much larger game. He was sacrificed for a bigger play to try to take out the King. But in doing so they just put pedophilia in the mainstream vernacular. Oops. Any decent human being does not think pedophilia is OK. However, there are many politicians that are advocating to lower the age of consent and make it legal for an adult and child or teenager to have a sexual relationship. They just legalized child prostitution in California under SB 1322. And there have been an increase in articles and shows normalizing pedophilia and calling it a mental disorder, not a crime. This is intentional. If you look through the DC Sex Offender registry, you can find many convicted pedophiles who worked for the government or work for them via another business. Watch this video to see it for yourself URL So how will this play out? I predict that Milo will take a hit but be just fine because he's protected by his people. But this will ultimately be a win for the people because it's just going to expose Truth even more. They made a mistake. God is on our side. Love and Truth is on our side and it won't be stopped. Get your popcorn ready because it's going to be a wild ride in 2017."

CIA wiretapped your TV and iPhone!!,317,5y09xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5y09xj/breaking_wikileaks_summary_of_their_vault_7/,2017-03-08 00:20:14,"[Wikileaks Vault 7 Release](URL &amp;nbsp; **Press Release** &amp;nbsp; Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named ""Vault 7"" by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency. The first full part of the series, ""Year Zero"", comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA's Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election. Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ""zero day"" exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive. ""Year Zero"" introduces the scope and direction of the CIA's global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of ""zero day"" weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple's iPhone, Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones. Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force  its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency's hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA (its primary bureaucratic rival) in order to draw on the NSA's hacking capacities. By the end of 2016, the CIA's hacking division, which formally falls under the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI), had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other ""weaponized"" malware. Such is the scale of the CIA's undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its ""own NSA"" with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified. In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA's hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons'. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such 'weapons', which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of ""Year Zero"" goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective."" Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the ""Year Zero"" disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of 'armed' cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA's program and how such 'weapons' should analyzed, disarmed and published. Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in ""Year Zero"" for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in ""Vault 7"" part one (Year Zero) already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks. &amp;nbsp; **Analysis** CIA malware targets iPhone, Android, smart TVs CIA malware and hacking tools are built by EDG (Engineering Development Group), a software development group within CCI (Center for Cyber Intelligence), a department belonging to the CIA's DDI (Directorate for Digital Innovation). The DDI is one of the five major directorates of the CIA (see this organizational chart of the CIA for more details). The EDG is responsible for the development, testing and operational support of all backdoors, exploits, malicious payloads, trojans, viruses and any other kind of malware used by the CIA in its covert operations world-wide. The increasing sophistication of surveillance techniques has drawn comparisons with George Orwell's 1984, but ""Weeping Angel"", developed by the CIA's Embedded Devices Branch (EDB), which infests smart TVs, transforming them into covert microphones, is surely its most emblematic realization. The attack against Samsung smart TVs was developed in cooperation with the United Kingdom's MI5/BTSS. After infestation, Weeping Angel places the target TV in a 'Fake-Off' mode, so that the owner falsely believes the TV is off when it is on. In 'Fake-Off' mode the TV operates as a bug, recording conversations in the room and sending them over the Internet to a covert CIA server. As of October 2014 the CIA was also looking at infecting the vehicle control systems used by modern cars and trucks. The purpose of such control is not specified, but it would permit the CIA to engage in nearly undetectable assassinations. The CIA's Mobile Devices Branch (MDB) developed numerous attacks to remotely hack and control popular smart phones. Infected phones can be instructed to send the CIA the user's geolocation, audio and text communications as well as covertly activate the phone's camera and microphone. Despite iPhone's minority share (14.5%) of the global smart phone market in 2016, a specialized unit in the CIA's Mobile Development Branch produces malware to infest, control and exfiltrate data from iPhones and other Apple products running iOS, such as iPads. CIA's arsenal includes numerous local and remote ""zero days"" developed by CIA or obtained from GCHQ, NSA, FBI or purchased from cyber arms contractors such as Baitshop. The disproportionate focus on iOS may be explained by the popularity of the iPhone among social, political, diplomatic and business elites. A similar unit targets Google's Android which is used to run the majority of the world's smart phones (~85%) including Samsung, HTC and Sony. 1.15 billion Android powered phones were sold last year. ""Year Zero"" shows that as of 2016 the CIA had 24 ""weaponized"" Android ""zero days"" which it has developed itself and obtained from GCHQ, NSA and cyber arms contractors. These techniques permit the CIA to bypass the encryption of WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wiebo, Confide and Cloackman by hacking the ""smart"" phones that they run on and collecting audio and message traffic before encryption is applied. &amp;nbsp; **CIA malware targets Windows, OSx, Linux, routers** The CIA also runs a very substantial effort to infect and control Microsoft Windows users with its malware. This includes multiple local and remote weaponized ""zero days"", air gap jumping viruses such as ""Hammer Drill"" which infects software distributed on CD/DVDs, infectors for removable media such as USBs, systems to hide data in images or in covert disk areas ( ""Brutal Kangaroo"") and to keep its malware infestations going. Many of these infection efforts are pulled together by the CIA's Automated Implant Branch (AIB), which has developed several attack systems for automated infestation and control of CIA malware, such as ""Assassin"" and ""Medusa"". Attacks against Internet infrastructure and webservers are developed by the CIA's Network Devices Branch (NDB). The CIA has developed automated multi-platform malware attack and control systems covering Windows, Mac OS X, Solaris, Linux and more, such as EDB's ""HIVE"" and the related ""Cutthroat"" and ""Swindle"" tools, which are described in the examples section below. &amp;nbsp; **CIA 'hoarded' vulnerabilities (""zero days"")** In the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks about the NSA, the U.S. technology industry secured a commitment from the Obama administration that the executive would disclose on an ongoing basis  rather than hoard  serious vulnerabilities, exploits, bugs or ""zero days"" to Apple, Google, Microsoft, and other US-based manufacturers. Serious vulnerabilities not disclosed to the manufacturers places huge swathes of the population and critical infrastructure at risk to foreign intelligence or cyber criminals who independently discover or hear rumors of the vulnerability. If the CIA can discover such vulnerabilities so can others. The U.S. government's commitment to the Vulnerabilities Equities Process came after significant lobbying by US technology companies, who risk losing their share of the global market over real and perceived hidden vulnerabilities. The government stated that it would disclose all pervasive vulnerabilities discovered after 2010 on an ongoing basis. ""Year Zero"" documents show that the CIA breached the Obama administration's commitments. Many of the vulnerabilities used in the CIA's cyber arsenal are pervasive and some may already have been found by rival intelligence agencies or cyber criminals. As an example, specific CIA malware revealed in ""Year Zero"" is able to penetrate, infest and control both the Android phone and iPhone software that runs or has run presidential Twitter accounts. The CIA attacks this software by using undisclosed security vulnerabilities (""zero days"") possessed by the CIA but if the CIA can hack these phones then so can everyone else who has obtained or discovered the vulnerability. As long as the CIA keeps these vulnerabilities concealed from Apple and Google (who make the phones) they will not be fixed, and the phones will remain hackable. The same vulnerabilities exist for the population at large, including the U.S. Cabinet, Congress, top CEOs, system administrators, security officers and engineers. By hiding these security flaws from manufacturers like Apple and Google the CIA ensures that it can hack everyone &amp;mdsh; at the expense of leaving everyone hackable. &amp;nbsp; **'Cyberwar' programs are a serious proliferation risk** Cyber 'weapons' are not possible to keep under effective control. While nuclear proliferation has been restrained by the enormous costs and visible infrastructure involved in assembling enough fissile material to produce a critical nuclear mass, cyber 'weapons', once developed, are very hard to retain. Cyber 'weapons' are in fact just computer programs which can be pirated like any other. Since they are entirely comprised of information they can be copied quickly with no marginal cost. Securing such 'weapons' is particularly difficult since the same people who develop and use them have the skills to exfiltrate copies without leaving traces  sometimes by using the very same 'weapons' against the organizations that contain them. There are substantial price incentives for government hackers and consultants to obtain copies since there is a global ""vulnerability market"" that will pay hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for copies of such 'weapons'. Similarly, contractors and companies who obtain such 'weapons' sometimes use them for their own purposes, obtaining advantage over their competitors in selling 'hacking' services. Over the last three years the United States intelligence sector, which consists of government agencies such as the CIA and NSA and their contractors, such as Booze Allan Hamilton, has been subject to unprecedented series of data exfiltrations by its own workers. A number of intelligence community members not yet publicly named have been arrested or subject to federal criminal investigations in separate incidents. Most visibly, on February 8, 2017 a U.S. federal grand jury indicted Harold T. Martin III with 20 counts of mishandling classified information. The Department of Justice alleged that it seized some 50,000 gigabytes of information from Harold T. Martin III that he had obtained from classified programs at NSA and CIA, including the source code for numerous hacking tools. Once a single cyber 'weapon' is 'loose' it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by peer states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike. &amp;nbsp; **U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt is a covert CIA hacker base** In addition to its operations in Langley, Virginia the CIA also uses the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt as a covert base for its hackers covering Europe, the Middle East and Africa. CIA hackers operating out of the Frankfurt consulate ( ""Center for Cyber Intelligence Europe"" or CCIE) are given diplomatic (""black"") passports and State Department cover. The instructions for incoming CIA hackers make Germany's counter-intelligence efforts appear inconsequential: ""Breeze through German Customs because you have your cover-for-action story down pat, and all they did was stamp your passport"" Your Cover Story (for this trip) Q: Why are you here? A: Supporting technical consultations at the Consulate. Two earlier WikiLeaks publications give further detail on CIA approaches to customs and secondary screening procedures. Once in Frankfurt CIA hackers can travel without further border checks to the 25 European countries that are part of the Shengen open border area  including France, Italy and Switzerland. A number of the CIA's electronic attack methods are designed for physical proximity. These attack methods are able to penetrate high security networks that are disconnected from the internet, such as police record database. In these cases, a CIA officer, agent or allied intelligence officer acting under instructions, physically infiltrates the targeted workplace. The attacker is provided with a USB containing malware developed for the CIA for this purpose, which is inserted into the targeted computer. The attacker then infects and exfiltrates data to removable media. For example, the CIA attack system Fine Dining, provides 24 decoy applications for CIA spies to use. To witnesses, the spy appears to be running a program showing videos (e.g VLC), presenting slides (Prezi), playing a computer game (Breakout2, 2048) or even running a fake virus scanner (Kaspersky, McAfee, Sophos). But while the decoy application is on the screen, the underlaying system is automatically infected and ransacked. &amp;nbsp; **How the CIA dramatically increased proliferation risks** In what is surely one of the most astounding intelligence own goals in living memory, the CIA structured its classification regime such that for the most market valuable part of ""Vault 7""  the CIA's weaponized malware (implants + zero days), Listening Posts (LP), and Command and Control (C2) systems  the agency has little legal recourse. The CIA made these systems unclassified. Why the CIA chose to make its cyberarsenal unclassified reveals how concepts developed for military use do not easily crossover to the 'battlefield' of cyber 'war'. To attack its targets, the CIA usually requires that its implants communicate with their control programs over the internet. If CIA implants, Command &amp; Control and Listening Post software were classified, then CIA officers could be prosecuted or dismissed for violating rules that prohibit placing classified information onto the Internet. Consequently the CIA has secretly made most of its cyber spying/war code unclassified. The U.S. government is not able to assert copyright either, due to restrictions in the U.S. Constitution. This means that cyber 'arms' manufactures and computer hackers can freely ""pirate"" these 'weapons' if they are obtained. The CIA has primarily had to rely on obfuscation to protect its malware secrets. Conventional weapons such as missiles may be fired at the enemy (i.e into an unsecured area). Proximity to or impact with the target detonates the ordnance including its classified parts. Hence military personnel do not violate classification rules by firing ordnance with classified parts. Ordnance will likely explode. If it does not, that is not the operator's intent. Over the last decade U.S. hacking operations have been increasingly dressed up in military jargon to tap into Department of Defense funding streams. For instance, attempted ""malware injections"" (commercial jargon) or ""implant drops"" (NSA jargon) are being called ""fires"" as if a weapon was being fired. However the analogy is questionable. Unlike bullets, bombs or missiles, most CIA malware is designed to live for days or even years after it has reached its 'target'. CIA malware does not ""explode on impact"" but rather permanently infests its target. In order to infect target's device, copies of the malware must be placed on the target's devices, giving physical possession of the malware to the target. To exfiltrate data back to the CIA or to await further instructions the malware must communicate with CIA Command &amp; Control (C2) systems placed on internet connected servers. But such servers are typically not approved to hold classified information, so CIA command and control systems are also made unclassified. A successful 'attack' on a target's computer system is more like a series of complex stock maneuvers in a hostile take-over bid or the careful planting of rumors in order to gain control over an organization's leadership rather than the firing of a weapons system. If there is a military analogy to be made, the infestation of a target is perhaps akin to the execution of a whole series of military maneuvers against the target's territory including observation, infiltration, occupation and exploitation. &amp;nbsp; **Evading forensics and anti-virus** A series of standards lay out CIA malware infestation patterns which are likely to assist forensic crime scene investigators as well as Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Nokia, Blackberry, Siemens and anti-virus companies attribute and defend against attacks. ""Tradecraft DO's and DON'Ts"" contains CIA rules on how its malware should be written to avoid fingerprints implicating the ""CIA, US government, or its witting partner companies"" in ""forensic review"". Similar secret standards cover the use of encryption to hide CIA hacker and malware communication (pdf), describing targets &amp; exfiltrated data (pdf) as well as executing payloads (pdf) and persisting (pdf) in the target's machines over time. CIA hackers developed successful attacks against most well known anti-virus programs. These are documented in AV defeats, Personal Security Products, Detecting and defeating PSPs and PSP/Debugger/RE Avoidance. For example, Comodo was defeated by CIA malware placing itself in the Window's ""Recycle Bin"". While Comodo 6.x has a ""Gaping Hole of DOOM"". CIA hackers discussed what the NSA's ""Equation Group"" hackers did wrong and how the CIA's malware makers could avoid similar exposure. &amp;nbsp; **EXAMPLES** The CIA's Engineering Development Group (EDG) management system contains around 500 different projects (only some of which are documented by ""Year Zero"") each with their own sub-projects, malware and hacker tools. The majority of these projects relate to tools that are used for penetration, infestation (""implanting""), control, and exfiltration. Another branch of development focuses on the development and operation of Listening Posts (LP) and Command and Control (C2) systems used to communicate with and control CIA implants; special projects are used to target specific hardware from routers to smart TVs. Some example projects are described below, but see the table of contents for the full list of projects described by WikiLeaks' ""Year Zero"". &amp;nbsp; **UMBRAGE** The CIA's hand crafted hacking techniques pose a problem for the agency. Each technique it has created forms a ""fingerprint"" that can be used by forensic investigators to attribute multiple different attacks to the same entity. This is analogous to finding the same distinctive knife wound on multiple separate murder victims. The unique wounding style creates suspicion that a single murderer is responsible. As soon one murder in the set is solved then the other murders also find likely attribution. The CIA's Remote Devices Branch's UMBRAGE group collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation. With UMBRAGE and related projects the CIA cannot only increase its total number of attack types but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the ""fingerprints"" of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from. UMBRAGE components cover keyloggers, password collection, webcam capture, data destruction, persistence, privilege escalation, stealth, anti-virus (PSP) avoidance and survey techniques. &amp;nbsp; **Fine Dining** Fine Dining comes with a standardized questionnaire i.e menu that CIA case officers fill out. The questionnaire is used by the agency's OSB (Operational Support Branch) to transform the requests of case officers into technical requirements for hacking attacks (typically ""exfiltrating"" information from computer systems) for specific operations. The questionnaire allows the OSB to identify how to adapt existing tools for the operation, and communicate this to CIA malware configuration staff. The OSB functions as the interface between CIA operational staff and the relevant technical support staff. Among the list of possible targets of the collection are 'Asset', 'Liason Asset', 'System Administrator', 'Foreign Information Operations', 'Foreign Intelligence Agencies' and 'Foreign Government Entities'. Notably absent is any reference to extremists or transnational criminals. The 'Case Officer' is also asked to specify the environment of the target like the type of computer, operating system used, Internet connectivity and installed anti-virus utilities (PSPs) as well as a list of file types to be exfiltrated like Office documents, audio, video, images or custom file types. The 'menu' also asks for information if recurring access to the target is possible and how long unobserved access to the computer can be maintained. This information is used by the CIA's 'JQJIMPROVISE' software (see below) to configure a set of CIA malware suited to the specific needs of an operation. &amp;nbsp; **Improvise (JQJIMPROVISE)** 'Improvise' is a toolset for configuration, post-processing, payload setup and execution vector selection for survey/exfiltration tools supporting all major operating systems like Windows (Bartender), MacOS (JukeBox) and Linux (DanceFloor). Its configuration utilities like Margarita allows the NOC (Network Operation Center) to customize tools based on requirements from 'Fine Dining' questionairies. &amp;nbsp; **HIVE** HIVE is a multi-platform CIA malware suite and its associated control software. The project provides customizable implants for Windows, Solaris, MikroTik (used in internet routers) and Linux platforms and a Listening Post (LP)/Command and Control (C2) infrastructure to communicate with these implants. The implants are configured to communicate via HTTPS with the webserver of a cover domain; each operation utilizing these implants has a separate cover domain and the infrastructure can handle any number of cover domains. Each cover domain resolves to an IP address that is located at a commercial VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. The public-facing server forwards all incoming traffic via a VPN to a 'Blot' server that handles actual connection requests from clients. It is setup for optional SSL client authentication: if a client sends a valid client certificate (only implants can do that), the connection is forwarded to the 'Honeycomb' toolserver that communicates with the implant; if a valid certificate is missing (which is the case if someone tries to open the cover domain website by accident), the traffic is forwarded to a cover server that delivers an unsuspicious looking website. The Honeycomb toolserver receives exfiltrated information from the implant; an operator can also task the implant to execute jobs on the target computer, so the toolserver acts as a C2 (command and control) server for the implant. Similar functionality (though limited to Windows) is provided by the RickBobby project. See the classified user and developer guides for HIVE. &amp;nbsp; **Frequently Asked Questions** &amp;nbsp; **Why now?** WikiLeaks published as soon as its verification and analysis were ready. In Febuary the Trump administration has issued an Executive Order calling for a ""Cyberwar"" review to be prepared within 30 days. While the review increases the timeliness and relevance of the publication it did not play a role in setting the publication date. &amp;nbsp; **Redactions** Names, email addresses and external IP addresses have been redacted in the released pages (70,875 redactions in total) until further analysis is complete. Over-redaction: Some items may have been redacted that are not employees, contractors, targets or otherwise related to the agency, but are, for example, authors of documentation for otherwise public projects that are used by the agency. Identity vs. person: the redacted names are replaced by user IDs (numbers) to allow readers to assign multiple pages to a single author. Given the redaction process used a single person may be represented by more than one assigned identifier but no identifier refers to more than one real person. Archive attachments (zip, tar.gz, ...) are replaced with a PDF listing all the file names in the archive. As the archive content is assessed it may be made available; until then the archive is redacted. Attachments with other binary content are replaced by a hex dump of the content to prevent accidental invocation of binaries that may have been infected with weaponized CIA malware. As the content is assessed it may be made available; until then the content is redacted. The tens of thousands of routable IP addresses references (including more than 22 thousand within the United States) that correspond to possible targets, CIA covert listening post servers, intermediary and test systems, are redacted for further exclusive investigation. Binary files of non-public origin are only available as dumps to prevent accidental invocation of CIA malware infected binaries. &amp;nbsp; **Organizational Chart** The organizational chart corresponds to the material published by WikiLeaks so far. Since the organizational structure of the CIA below the level of Directorates is not public, the placement of the EDG and its branches within the org chart of the agency is reconstructed from information contained in the documents released so far. It is intended to be used as a rough outline of the internal organization; please be aware that the reconstructed org chart is incomplete and that internal reorganizations occur frequently. &amp;nbsp; **Wiki pages** ""Year Zero"" contains 7818 web pages with 943 attachments from the internal development groupware. The software used for this purpose is called Confluence, a proprietary software from Atlassian. Webpages in this system (like in Wikipedia) have a version history that can provide interesting insights on how a document evolved over time; the 7818 documents include these page histories for 1136 latest versions. The order of named pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). Page content is not present if it was originally dynamically created by the Confluence software (as indicated on the re-constructed page). &amp;nbsp; **FAQ** &amp;nbsp; **What time period is covered?** The years 2013 to 2016. The sort order of the pages within each level is determined by date (oldest first). WikiLeaks has obtained the CIA's creation/last modification date for each page but these do not yet appear for technical reasons. Usually the date can be discerned or approximated from the content and the page order. If it is critical to know the exact time/date contact WikiLeaks. &amp;nbsp; **What is ""Vault 7""** ""Vault 7"" is a substantial collection of material about CIA activities obtained by WikiLeaks. &amp;nbsp; **When was each part of ""Vault 7"" obtained?** Part one was obtained recently and covers through 2016. Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. &amp;nbsp; **Is each part of ""Vault 7"" from a different source?** Details on the other parts will be available at the time of publication. &amp;nbsp; **What is the total size of ""Vault 7""?** The series is the largest intelligence publication in history. &amp;nbsp; **How did WikiLeaks obtain each part of ""Vault 7""?** Sources trust WikiLeaks to not reveal information that might help identify them. &amp;nbsp; **Isn't WikiLeaks worried that the CIA will act against its staff to stop the series?** No. That would be certainly counter-productive. &amp;nbsp; **Has WikiLeaks already 'mined' all the best stories?** No. WikiLeaks has intentionally not written up hundreds of impactful stories to encourage others to find them and so create expertise in the area for subsequent parts in the series. They're there. Look. Those who demonstrate journalistic excellence may be considered for early access to future parts. &amp;nbsp; **Won't other journalists find all the best stories before me?** Unlikely. There are very considerably more stories than there are journalists or academics who are in a position to write them."

Milosevic was arrested six months after Kostunica took office for war crimes and crimes against humanity in 2001. He stood trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague until his death in 2006. The transition was not smooth, however; the DOS coalition that took over the government was organized around removing Milosevic and beyond that it had serious internal divisions. President Kostunica had to rely on a coalition government and competition between him and DOSs Prime Minister Zoran ini meant continued disagreement over the extent to which reforms could be implemented. Two major institutions in Serbian societythe Serbian Orthodox Church and the militaryfavored the elimination of Milosevics rule, but were suspicious of some reforms that threatened to undermine their place in traditional culture. Moreover, in 2003 plotters from nationalist and former security forces assassinated Prime Minister ini, although the backlash from that event facilitated a crackdown on organized crime and the implementation of other democratic reforms. In 2006 Montenegro broke away from the successor to Yugoslavia, The Union of Serbia and Montenegro, after a referendum approving independence was narrowly approved in Montenegro. After three attempts to elect a president in 2003-2004, because of low voter turnout, reform president Boris Tadic became president and advanced the dismantling of many of the lingering pillars of the Milosevic regime. Serbias efforts to join the European Union have been complicated by an initial condition that Serbia cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia; many were reluctant to turn over key Serbian figures and especially to extradite Ratko Mladi, who remains a fugitive (with the government claiming that he is no longer in Serbia). Beginning 1 February 2010 an Interim Agreement goes into effect between the EU and Serbia that may lead to its eventually joining the EU, as formally requested in December 2009."

The democrat's letter to Pence acknowledges all the known-in-November facts about Flynn's lobbying and attempts to imply that Flynn's role really is for Russian and Turkish governments. Flynn's recent registration as foreign agent is a sort of admission that he was in fact working for the interest of the Turkish government as far back as November.

Denial - In this stage individuals believe the situation is somehow mistaken, and cling to a false, preferable reality where everyone wins a trophy. 2. Anger - When the individual recognizes that denial cannot continue, they become frustrated and angry, sometimes resorting to making signs or arguing in all caps. 3. Bargaining - Feelings of helplessness and vulnerability lead to a need to regain control though negotiation, compromise, and binge eating. 4. Depression - The individual despairs at the recognition of truth, often though silence and petty sulking in their parents basement, or a college safe space. 5. Bill Clinton is a rapist."

Among the dead, 2 CIA operators. - In response, Clinton ordered missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. - Clinton claimed the site was being used by Osama bin Laden to manufacture chemical weapons. - It wasnt. - It was just a pharmaceutical factory. This factory supplied around 50% of Sudans medicine. - Malaria mortality rates declined steadily from 1900 all the way through the 1980s. . - In the 1990s, the mortality rates skyrocketed, rising over 40%. This was caused by medication shortage. - This medication shortage was caused in large part by direct and indirect actions taken by the Clinton administration to destabilize Africa. - Not one to let a good crisis go to waste, Clinton sponsored several programs to boost spending to fight these problems. - These programs are designed to funnel money out of government, into the hands of Clinton cronies. - Clinton and large pharmaceutical companies are financially connected. - Clinical trials in third world countries are out of control. Pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of uninformed populations in order to collect data for pipeline products. This is not the case in every instance, but it is happening, and all major pharmaceutical companies knowingly sponsor such programs. - The Board of Directors at the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children consists of people with even closer relationships to the pharmaceutical industry. In fact, you might say they are one in the same. - The Board of Directors at the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children also has direct ties to the Clintons. - I submit, without verifiable evidence, that these relationships are the primary source of financial support for the horrors of modern human trafficking. - Human experimentation in the U.S. dates back at least a century. Funding for many of the experiments was provided by United States government, especially the United States military, Central Intelligence Agency, or private corporations involved with military activities. The human research programs were usually highly secretive, and in many cases information about them was not released until many years after the studies had been performed. [**WIKIPEDIA**](URL - These experiments have been performed on Americans and foreign nationals, both in the United States and abroad, by government agencies as well as corporations. - Operation Midnight Climax: Several significant operational techniques were developed in this theater, including **extensive research into sexual blackmail, surveillance technology, and the possible use of mind-altering drugs in field operations.** - [**WIKIPEDIA**](URL [Whiteout: The CIA, Drugs, and the Press](URL &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Prudence Bushnell** - [**WIKIPEDIA**](URL - Following graduation, Bushnell went to work as a management consultant in Texas. She joined the foreign service in 1981 as an administrative track officer, with her first assignment being in Bombay, India. She then served as Deputy Chief of Mission under Ambassador George Moose at the U.S. Embassy in Dakar, Senegal. - In 1993, Ambassador Moose was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs by President Bill Clinton. Bushnell accompanied Moose to serve as Deputy Assistant Secretary. - **Bushnell's time in Washington was marked by extreme tension in Africa.** - **Black Hawk Down** On October 3, 1993, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in an attempt to apprehend warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid at the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia. The American public was appalled at the deaths and support for American involvement in African affairs suffered as a result. - It was against this backdrop that the **Rwandan Genocide** began. On April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvnal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, were both killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Kigali Airport in Rwanda. Responsibility for the assassinations has never been clearly established, however, the resulting chaos was the catalyst for the masacre of Tutsis at the hands of Rwanda's Hutu majority. - **Bushnell, who had been visiting the area just weeks before, released a memorandum immediately following the assassinations. In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell's recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias.** &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador to Kenya** - Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996. Upon confirmation by the United States Senate, Bushnell took up residence in Nairobi. - Bushnell used her office to push Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to institute democratic reforms and to root out corruption in his government, a major drag on Kenya's economy. - Bushnell was also alarmed at the vulnerability of the U.S. embassy compound to attack. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ### For over a year, she complained about security conditions to her superiors in Washington. ### Despite Bushnell's request for a new, secure building, a State Department evaluation team concluded that a renovation would suffice. ### August 7, 1998 a car bomb was detonated next to the embassy by al-Qaeda agents. &amp;nbsp; **1998 US Embassies in Africa Bombings Fast Facts** - [**CNN**](URL JULY 27, 2015 - August 7, 1998 - Almost simultaneously, bombs explode at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people.

The administrationof President Bill Clinton justified the attacks, dubbed Operation Infinite Reach, on the grounds that the al-Shifa plant was involved with processing the deadly nerve agent VX, and had ties with the Islamist al-Qaeda group of Osama bin Laden, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ### Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory The Al-Shifa (, Arabic for ""healing"") pharmaceutical factory in **Khartoum North, Sudan**, was constructed between 1992 and 1996 with components imported from **Germany**, **India**, **Italy**, **Sweden**, **Switzerland**, **Thailand** and the **United States**.

Interior Minister Abdul Rahim told CNN in a telephone interview that the privately owned pharmaceutical firm had ""nothing to do with chemical weapons."" - **""We have no chemical weapons factory in our country,""** he said. - A statement read on Sudanese television about an hour after the attack said, ""The wrongful American air force launched air attacks on Sudan tonight which aimed at strategic and vital areas."" There was no report as to the number of casualties. &amp;nbsp; **""We have no chemical weapons factory in our country.** &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ### Turns out thats the truth.. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **The Missiles of August** - [**NEW YORKER**](URL OCT 12, 1998 - The Sudanese plant, depicted by the White House as a chemical-warfare facility, was one of 2 targets in a retaliatory raid against Saudi terrorist Osama bin Laden, who was linked to the bombings of American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania earlier that month; Tomahawks were also fired at sites in Afghanistan suspected to be terrorist training camps under the control of bin Laden. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **They bomb pharmacies, don't they?** - [**SALON**](URL SEP 23, 1998 - On Aug. 20, President Clinton personally ordered the leveling of the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical plant on the outskirts of Khartoum. - Sources in U.S. Intelligence apparently claimed that there was only one window through which to strike at bin Laden, and that the only time they could hope to hit his Afghan fastness by this remote means was on the night of Monica Lewinskys return to the grand jury. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Look at the Place!

The destroyed factory has become a monument of sorts, a place that Sudanese authorities say symbolizes the mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the world's superpower. - ""The government wants it as a showcase,"" said Eltayeb Hag Ateya, director of the Peace Studies Institute at the University of Khartoum. ""It's still a thorn in Sudan-American relations. It will always be a point for the Sudanese government to bring up."" - Well then, what was the hurry? A hurry that was panicky enough for the president and his advisors to pick the wrong objective and then, stained with embarrassment and retraction, to refuse the open inquiry that could have settled the question in the first place? There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look presidential for a day. &amp;nbsp; **The Observer** noted that ""The loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines"" quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with ""intimate knowledge"" of the destroyed plant. A month later, Guardian correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant ""provided 50 percent of Sudans medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria"". (Wintour, Patrick, The Observer, 20 December 1998.) &amp;nbsp; He continued that, despite this, the **British government (who publicly backed the attack) refused requests ""to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production"".** The factory was a principal source of Sudan's anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW Conventions Bulletin. [**THE CBW CONVENTIONS BULLETIN**](URL &amp;nbsp; ### Coincidentally Malaria Spirals Out of Control **Malaria Surveillance - United States, 1999** - [**CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL**](URL **Interpretation:** - The 25.5% increase in malaria cases in 1999, compared with 1998, resulted primarily from increases in cases acquired in Africa and the Americas. - This increase is possibly related to a change in the system by which states report to CDC, but it could also have resulted from local changes in disease transmission, increased travel to these regions, improved reporting to state and local health departments, or a **decreased use of effective antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.** - In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired infection abroad were not on an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen for the country where they acquired malaria. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Public Complain of Malaria Vaccine Shortage** - [**GHANA WEB**](URL NOV 3, 2000 - The general public has raised concern and doubt over malaria vaccines, which they said are running short in health centres. - In an interview in health centres, members of the public expressed 'strong interest', calling for 'immediate' explanation from the health department over what they saw as the acute shortage of chloroquine vaccines at a time when malaria is taking a high toll on the population. &amp;nbsp; ### Time to act! What can USAID do for you? **United States Agency for International Development** USAID's programs are authorized by the Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act, which the Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. Although it is technically an independent agency, USAID operates subject to the foreign policy guidance of the President, Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. USAID operates in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. &amp;nbsp; **Evaluating Malaria Interventions In Africa: A Review and Assessment of Recent Research** - [**USAID**](URL NOV 1999 - According to the most recent data, 40% (2,400 million) of the world population in over 90 countries is affected by malaria. In any given year, nearly 10% of the global population will suffer a case of malaria (Malaria International, 1998). - There are 300 - 500 million clinical cases of malaria worldwide each year with the majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 1998). - Malaria has been estimated to cause 9% of all disease in Africa (Nchinda, 1998). - According to recent data, there are 1.5  2.7 million deaths due to malaria each year, the bulk of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 360 million people live in areas of stable, endemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission (Snow et al., 1999a). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Rolling Back Malaria**- [**WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION**](URL - 1999 - Almost 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur worldwide each year and over one million people die. - Almost 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where young children are the most affected. - Malaria is directly responsible for one in five childhood deaths in Africa and indirectly contributes to illness and deaths from respiratory infections, diarrheal disease and malnutrition. &amp;nbsp; **The author then uses good information in a manner that is very misleading.** - Chloroquine, perhaps the best ever antimalarial drug, and certainly the most widely used, is now failing against falciparum malaria in most areas of the tropical world. **True** - In some areas, such as parts of South-East Asia and South America, chloroquine is now completely ineffective against P. falciparum malaria. **True, but were talking about Africa. Thats where the problem is.** - In many parts of India and Africa, its effectiveness is falling rapidly. **True, but still misleading. Per the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), despite declining use, CQ remained the first-line therapy for uncomplicated P.f. malaria in the majority of sub-Saharan countries until after 2000.** - [**US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE**](URL - For the treatment of falciparum malaria, the usual successor to chloroquine is a combination of pyrimethamine and a long acting sulphonamide (SP), which is also affordable and well tolerated. Five countries in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland) have now been forced to switch from chloroquine to SP as the first line antimalarial treatment. - Unfortunately, in several of the areas where it has been deployed, notably South-East Asia and South America, P. falciparum has become widely SP-resistant. I thought we were talking about sub-Saharan Africa. ### The truth is, the resurgence of malaria is in large part, the result of Bill Clintons destabilization of Africa. (Ok Bush too, but we will discuss that later) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **WHO backs controversial chemical for malaria control** - [**SCI DEV NET**](URL SEP 18, 2006 - The controversial insecticide DDT  which most nations have banned  is back on the menu for malaria control after the World Health Organization reversed a 30-year old policy on Friday (15 September). - The move puts annual indoor spraying of DDT alongside drugs and bednets as one of the three main tools for controlling the disease. - ""The scientific and programmatic evidence clearly supports this reassessment,"" said Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria at the World Health Organization (WHO). - ""[Indoor spraying] has proven to be just as cost-effective as other malaria prevention methods, and DDT presents no health risk when used properly."" - The chemical kills the mosquitoes that spread malaria. It helped eradicate the disease from southern Europe and North America in the 1960s. - DDT is also toxic to birds, fish and mammals. It accumulates in the food chain and remains in the environment for many years. In the 1970s, growing awareness of these threats led many countries to ban its use in agriculture. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Malaria linked to catastrophic spread of AIDS in Africa** - [**SCI DEV NET**](URL DEC 8, 2006 - Research in Kenya indicates that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS across Africa could be linked to malaria. - The work has important implications for public health policies in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need to tackle both diseases together. - There is considerable geographical overlap between HIV/AIDS  which infects over 40 million people in Africa  and malaria, which causes 500 million clinical infections each year. - People with both malaria and HIV/AIDS are more likely to transmit the HIV virus, according to the study published in the journal Science today (8 December). This may have promoted the rapid spread of the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. - ""We have always known the relationship between [malaria and HIV/AIDS], but we did not know the impact it had on the spread: now we have a reference point,"" says Ayub Manya, an epidemiologist with the Kenyan National Malaria Control Programme. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **World Bank head praises DDT use against malaria** - [**SCI DEV NET**](URL MAR 19, 2007 - World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz has praised South Africa's malaria control programme, saying the country's use of indoor residual spraying has reduced malaria episodes. - Wolfowitz says he will consider taking South Africa's approach to other malaria-affected countries. He committed around US$48 million for malaria control in 14 African countries, which could increase, depending on success. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **The Malaria Vaccine Funders Group** The Malaria Vaccine Funders Group - having a joint vision for a major contribution to a world free from malaria morbidity and mortality through vaccination - has its origins in discussions among representatives from the **World Health Organization** (WHO), the **United States Agency for International Development** (USAID), the **European Commission** (EC) and the **European Vaccine Initiative** (EVI) - The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) - The European Commission (EC) - The European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) - The European Vaccine Initiative (EVI) - The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) - The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Extramural Malaria Program - The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Malaria Vaccine Development Program (MVDP) - The Wellcome Trust - The World Health Organization (WHO) Initiative for Vaccine Research (IVR) &amp;nbsp; ### This is not limited to Malaria or Clinton. &amp;nbsp; The **President's Emergency Plan For AIDS Relief (PEPFAR/Emergency Plan)** is a United States governmental initiative to address the global HIV/AIDS epidemic and help save the lives of those suffering from the disease, primarily in Africa. **Implementing Agencies** - Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) - Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) - Department of Defense (DoD) - Department of Commerce (DoC) - Department of Labor (DoL) - Peace Corps &amp;nbsp; The program has provided antiretroviral treatment (ART) to over 7.7 million HIV-infected people in resource-limited settings and supported HIV testing and counseling (HTC) for more than 56.7 million people as of 2014.[1] PEPFAR increased the number of Africans receiving ART from 50,000 at the start of the initiative in 2004.[2][3][4] PEPFAR has been called the largest health initiative ever initiated by one country to address a disease. The budget presented for the fiscal year 2016 included a request for $1.11 billion for PEPFAR as well as contributions from global organizations such as UNAIDS and private donors. &amp;nbsp; **Abdullahi v.

By mid-July, seven of them had raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for her presidential campaign, according to campaign finance records. - They include Heather and Tony Podesta, the recently divorced Democratic power brokers. Heather Podesta represents health insurer Cigna, while Tony lobbies on behalf of pharmaceutical firms Amgen and EMD Serono, a division of drug giant Merck. - The Podestas have also given as much as $150,000 to the Clinton Foundation, according to that groups list of donors. - Insurers Humana and Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina and drug company Pfizer have donated between $1 million and $5 million.

Don't fall for that mistake. Do not mistake people who are able to practice healthy emotional management for people with no hearts. Do not mistake emotional vulnerability for purity of heart and humanity. These are not the same. Crying is the not by itself the mark of a good heart. You could be highly skillful at emotional management, and also possess a good, pure, loving, and caring heart. Meaning, you're able to witness the horrors and ugliness in this world in stillness and strength without collapsing or crying, or screaming and complaining, but instead absorbing all that pain and overcoming it and trying to fix all that had gone wrong. You're able to help others better because of your stillness. That's not being an asshole. It's bravery and nobility. You could ""sympathize"" with every animal in the world sobbing and screaming for their pain and their (truly) horrifying treatment. But then go commit terrorist acts like arson and even murder of other humans in the name of loving animals and caring about them. That's not being humane and merciful nor is it civil or loving. It's mental illness. We live in a world where mental illness is glorified, and bravery and nobility are defiled. It's an upside down world. If you think this reversal of values is a coincidence, you're mistaken. Someone willed this. If you think this is a recent phenomenon, or a local one, you're also mistaken. If you trace the source of this reversal of values, it will take you to unimaginable places. The point is: Liberals, you don't have the higher moral ground just because you have emotions. Emotional blackmail is such a cheap strategy and you have been exclusively using it to promote your cause. But it doesn't work anymore. "

In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell's recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias.** &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador to Kenya** - Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996.

Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait. **Bill Clinton bombed Saddam to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - what Huma Abedin's Muslim journal claimed about her boss's husband** - [DAILY MAIL](URL AUG 26, 2016 - Huma Abedin, Clinton's right-hand woman, was for 12 years the assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. - In 2002 the supposedly academic journal published claims by a Canadian law student about the 1998 bombing Bill Clinton ordered in Iraq. - Sina Ali Musati claimed he did it as a distraction from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - which was then at its height. - Clinton campaign claims Abedin was not involved in actually editing the magazine saying she was 'just on the masthead'. - But did not explain how that squared with her being on the editorial board. - Her mother is editor-in-chief and suggested U.S. was responsible for 9/11 while another article said Jews were 'adept' at influencing politics. - The article was written by Sina Ali Muscati who was the time described as a 'second year law student' at the University of Ottawa. His academic credentials were not declared. - Muscati wrote about the 1991 conflict and its aftermath, which saw Saddam Hussein remain in power throughout the 1990s, despite being bombed twice - in 1996 and in December 1998. - 'The crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited Clinton, serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises, such as his campaign funding scandals, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair,' he said. - 'By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least, he has been able to look strong and presidential.' - Clinton's bombing of Iraq in December 1998 was widely mocked as 'Monica's war'. - He ordered four days of strikes by bombers and cruise missiles at the height of his impeachment trial, brought in the wake of his admission that he had had a 'not appropriate' relationship with Monica Lewinsky. # Sound familiar?

59,vulnerability,The_Donald,Groups call for weekly anti-Trump protests in cities across the US on Tuesdays through April 29.,3,5q63ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5q63ku/groups_call_for_weekly_antitrump_protests_in/,2017-01-26 08:38:37,"Just got this: Subject: Alert: US - Anti-Trump Protests Worldcue Alert Severity: Informational Alert Security: Groups call for weekly anti-Trump protests in cities across the US on Tuesdays through April 29. Plan for minor transport disruptions near government offices. The locations affected by this alert are:  Chicago, Illinois  Los Angeles, California  Washington, DC  New York City, New York  San Francisco, California  Seattle, Washington  Portland, Oregon This alert began 25 Jan 2017 20:13 GMT and is scheduled to expire 28 Feb 2017 23:59 GMT.  Event: Anti-Trump protests  Location: Major cities across the US (map)  Time Frame: Tuesdays, through April 29  Impact: Localized traffic disruptions, temporary street closures, heightened security, possible skirmishes Summary Activist groups have called for weekly protests across the US in response to Cabinet confirmation hearings and actions taken by the newly inaugurated President Donald Trump administration. The so-called 'Resist Trump Tuesday' actions will likely take place near federal government offices - including Congressional offices - through April 29. Though turnout will be highly variable across the country, the biggest demonstrations could occur in Washington, DC; New York, N.Y.; Chicago, Ill.; San Francisco and Los Angeles, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; and Seattle, Wash. Most of the demonstrations will probably be small and peaceful. Disruptions will likely be minimal since the groups will primarily rally outside of the government offices. Localized transport disruptions cannot be ruled out, especially if the protesters decide to stage street marches. While major security problems are unlikely, small skirmishes between protesters and police remain possible. Protesters could also gather outside of educational institutions and Trump-branded properties during President Trump's first 100 days in office. An increased police presence is possible around some of these buildings; any large demonstrations that might form will likely be monitored by authorities to mitigate disruptions. Advice Allow extra time if commuting to or from downtown areas in major cities when demonstrations are likely. Consider avoiding rallies due to the potential for street closures, traffic congestion, and security disturbances. Monitor local media for updated information about security and road conditions. Check public transit schedules for possible service changes if large demonstrations materialize.

60,vulnerability,The_Donald,The 4 Stages of Islamic Conquest,22,5qgumw,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qgumw/the_4_stages_of_islamic_conquest/,2017-01-27 23:33:22,"URL STAGE 1: INFILTRATION Muslims begin moving to non-Muslim countries in increasing numbers and the beginning of cultural conflicts are visible, though often subtle. First migration wave to non-Muslim host country. Appeal for humanitarian tolerance from the host society. Attempts to portray Islam as a peaceful &amp; Muslims as victims of misunderstanding and racism (even though Islam is not a race). High Muslim birth rate in host country increase Muslim population. Mosques used to spread Islam and dislike of host country &amp; culture. Calls to criminalize Islamophobia as a hate crime. Threatened legal action for perceived discrimination. Offers of interfaith dialogue to indoctrinate non-Muslims. How many nations are suffering from Islamic infiltration? One? A handful? Nearly every nation? The Islamic leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood and others wish to dissolve each nations sovereignty and replace it with the global imposition of Islamic sharia law. Sharia law, based on the koran, sira and hadith, condemns liberty and forbids equality and is inconsistent with the laws of all Western nations. As the author and historian Serge Trifkovic states: The refusal of the Western elite class to protect their nations from jihadist infiltration is the biggest betrayal in history. STAGE 2: CONSOLIDATION OF POWER Muslim immigrants and host country converts continue demands for accommodation in employment, education, social services, financing and courts. Proselytizing increases; Establishment and Recruitment of Jihadi cells. Efforts to convert alienated segments of the population to Islam. Revisionist efforts to Islamize history. Efforts to destroy historic evidence that reveal true Islamism. Increased anti-western propaganda and psychological warfare. Efforts to recruit allies who share similar goals (communists, anarchists). Attempts to indoctrinate children to Islamist viewpoint. Increased efforts to intimidate, silence and eliminate non-Muslims. Efforts to introduce blasphemy and hate laws in order to silence critics. Continued focus on enlarging Muslim population by increasing Muslim births and immigration. Use of charities to recruit supporters and fund jihad. Covert efforts to bring about the destruction of host society from within. Development of Muslim political base in non-Muslim host society. Islamic Financial networks fund political growth, acquisition of land. Highly visible assassination of critics aimed to intimidate opposition. Tolerance of non-Muslims diminishes. Greater demands to adopt strict Islamic conduct. Clandestine amassing of weapons and explosives in hidden locations. Overt disregard/rejection of non-Muslim societys legal system, culture. Efforts to undermine and destroy power base of non-Muslim religions including and especially Jews and Christians. Is there a pattern here? Theo van Gogh is murdered in the Netherlands for insulting Islam; the Organization of the Islamic Conference demands anti-blasphemy laws through the United Nations; France is set afire regularly by youths (read Muslims); the rise of (dis-) honor killingsholocaust denialanti-Semitismdeception re the tenets of Islam; hatred toward Christians and Jews and Hindus and Buddhists. The pattern for all to see is the rise of Islamic intolerance and the covert/cultural jihad to remake host societies into sharia-compliant worlds  to remove host sovereignty and replace it with Islamic sharia law. Sharia law that condemns earthly liberty and individual freedom, that forbids equality among faiths and between the sexes, that rejects the concept of nations outside the global house of Islam, that of dar al-Islam. STAGE 3: OPEN WAR w/ LEADERSHIP &amp; CULTURE Open violence to impose Sharia law and associated cultural restrictions; rejection of host government, subjugation of other religions and customs. Intentional efforts to undermine the host government &amp; culture. Acts of barbarity to intimidate citizens and foster fear and submission. Open and covert efforts to cause economic collapse of the society. All opposition is challenged and either eradicated or silenced. Mass execution of non-Muslims. Widespread ethnic cleansing by Islamic militias. Rejection and defiance of host society secular laws or culture. Murder of moderate Muslim intellectuals who dont support Islamization. Destruction of churches, synagogues and other non-Muslim institutions. Women are restricted further in accordance with Sharia law. Large-scale destruction of population, assassinations, bombings. Toppling of government and usurpation of political power. Imposition of Sharia law The website URL keeps track of the number of violent jihad attacks as best it can. The site lists more than 14,000 attacks since September 2001. It is worth a visit. What is occurring, however, that is likely inestimable are events where muslims are bullied by other muslims for not being muslim enough, where non-Muslims are intimidated into doing or not doing what they desire, where remnant populations are in a death spiral simply for being non-muslim in a predominantly muslim area. Christians, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists Animists and Atheists meet with death, property destruction or confiscation, forced conversion, rape, excessive taxation (the jizya), enslavement, riotous mobs and various other forms of islam (in-) justice at the hands of muslims in Sudan, Philippines, Kenya, Malaysia, India, etc. And let us not forget death to Apostates the world over. STAGE 4: Totalitarian ISLAMIC THEOCRACY Islam becomes the only religious-political-judicial-cultural ideology. Sharia becomes the law of the land. All non-Islamic human rights cancelled. Enslavement and genocide of non-Muslim population. Freedom of speech and the press eradicated. All religions other than Islam are forbidden and destroyed. Destruction of all evidence of non-Muslim culture, populations and symbols in country (Buddhas, houses of worship, art, etc). The House of Islam (peace), dar al-Islam, includes those nations that have submitted to Islamic rule, to the soul crushing, liberty-condemning, discriminatory law of Sharia. The rest of the world in in the House of War, dar al-harb, because it does not submit to Sharia, and exists in a state of rebellion or war with the will of Allah. No non-Muslim state or its citizens are innocent, and remain viable targets of war for not believing in Allah. The Christian, Jewish, Coptic, Hindu and Zoroastrian peoples of world have suffered under subjugation for centuries. The Dhimmi-esque are forbidden to construct houses of worship or repair existing ones, economically crippled by the heavy jizya (tax), socially humiliated, legally discriminated against, criminally targeted and generally kept in a permanent state of weakness, fear and vulnerability by Islamic governments. It should be noted that forced conversions (Egypt) and slavery (Sudan) are still reported. Homosexuals have been hung in the public square in Iran. Young girls are married to old men. Apostates are threatened with death. Honor killings are routine. Women are legally second-class citizens, though Muslim males insist they are treated better than in the West. These more obvious manifestations may distract from some less obvious ones such as the lack of intellectual inquiry in science, narrow scope of writing, all but non-existent art and music, sexual use and abuse of youth and women, and the disregard for personal fulfillment, joy and wonder. Look into the eyes of a recently married 12 year old girl to see the consequence of the moral deprivation spawned by Islam. "
61,vulnerability,The_Donald,Understanding Taqiyya  Islamic Lying,6,5qjdgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qjdgw/understanding_taqiyya_islamic_lying/,2017-01-28 07:10:31,"URL In Islam, taqiyya  (alternative spellings taqiyeh, taqiya, taqiyah, tuqyah) is a form of religious dissimulation, or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny his faith or commit otherwise illegal or blasphemous acts while they are in fear, intending to deceive the unbeliever or at risk of significant persecution. The practice of taqiyya in difficult circumstances is considered legitimate by Muslims of various sects. Sunni and Shia commentators alike observe that verse 16:106 refers to the case of Ammar b. Yasir, who was forced to renounce his beliefs under physical duress and torture. Quran 3:28 enjoins Muslims not to take the company of non-Muslims over Muslims unless as a means of safeguarding themselves. Let not the believers take those who deny the truth for their allies in preference to the believers  since he who does this cuts himself off from God in everything  unless it be to protect yourself against them in this way Regarding 3:28, Ibn Kathir, a prominent authority writes, meaning, except those believers who in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers. In this case, such believers are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. He quotes Muhammads companion, Abu Ad-Darda, who said we smile in the face of some people although our hearts curse them, and Al-Hasan who said the Tuqyah is acceptable till the Day of Resurrection. ____________________ Taqiyya  Islamic Dissimulation By Kamal Ishak TAQIYYA  Dissimulation. There are two forms of lying to non-believers that are islamicaly permitted, TAQIYYA and KITMAN. The purpose is to achieve the advance the cause Islam, by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them. TAQIYYA: From the root word WAQA, to safeguard: caution, fear, self- protection; and hence dissimulation [in order to protect oneself]. KITMAN: Disguise. Both are technical terms within the Islamic belief for dispensation from the requirements of religion under compulsion or threat of injury, due to fear of physical or mental damage. (Sura III, v. 28) Let not the believers Take for friends or helpers Unbelievers rather than believers: if any do that, in nothing will there be help from Allah, except by TAQIYYA, that ye may Guard yourselves from them. But Allah cautions you NAFSAHU. This verse tells Muslims not to take non-Muslims as friends, unless it is to guard themselves . The Koran verse is somewhat not clear. NAFSAHU means Allah Himself is referring to the same thing, i.e. the act of TAQIYYA? Lets see the provisions of the Koran: (Sura II, v. 225) Allah will not call you to account for thoughtlessness in your oaths, but for the intention in your hearts. Allah gives allowance of perjury of ones oaths. (Sura IX, v. 3) announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people , that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the unbelievers. The dissolution of oaths with the non-Muslims, and freedom from liability to them is islamicaly legal. They are evicted anyway. (Sura LXVI, v. 2) Allah has already ordained for you, (O men), (how is) the dissolution of your oaths. Allah indicated how to dissolute oaths. (Sura XL, v. 28) A believer who had concealed his faith... A Muslim can hide his faith among those who are not believers. (Sura XVI, v. 106) Any one who, after accepting faith in Allah, utters unbelief,- except under compulsion, his heart remaining rm in Faith  but such as open their breast to Unbelief, on them is Wrath from Allah. That means, a Muslim can tell lie, denying Islam. A Muslim may be compelled to deceive others for a greater purpose.We can attribute the above mentioned to the characteristics of Allah. (Sura III, v. 54) And (the unbelievers) deceived, and Allah deceived too, and the best of deceivers is Allah. This is one of many verses of the Koran incorrectly translated in English. The tendentious version reads: plotted and planned, and Allah too weaves. Allah is the best of planners. The Arabic word used here is Makara, which literally means cheated or deceived slyly. The purpose is too clear .. to deceive readers. Allah is the extreme deceiver. (See also Sura VIII, v. Sura 30 and X, v. 21). The Arabic word used here is MAKARA, which literally means deceit. Allah is supremely deceitful. (See also Sura VIII, v. 30 and Sura X, v. 21). We refer also to the traditions of the Prophet:  The Prophet said: War is deceit. (Bukhari)  ALY confirmed that lying is permissible in order to deceive an enemy. (Bukhari).  Lying is permitted when the end justifies the means.(Ibn Abbas) If any one is compelled and professes unbelief with his tongue, while his heart contradicts him, in order to escape his enemies, no blame falls on him, because Allah takes his servants as their hearts believe. (Exegesis of Tabari, Sura XVI, v. 106). (Zamakhshari) Allah licensed for Muslims, in case of living under the laws of non-Muslims, to co-habitat with them apparently peacefully, but on the contrary, the heart reassuring hostility and hatred and wait for the demise of the inhibitor. (KASHSHAF). In short, the Muslim lie to stave off the threat or punishment. (Ibn KATHIR) Those believers, who live in some areas or times fear for their safety from the disbelievers, are allowed to show friendship to the disbelievers outwardly, but never inwardly. (Muhammads Companion, Abu Ad-Darda) We smile in the face of some people while our hearts curse them. (Bukhari, vol. 7). This practice was emphasized in Shiaa Muslims The eighth Imam Shiaa said: The one who does not practice TAQIYYA has no faith. (Kashf al-Ghummah, Al-Ardabili).Nine tenths (90%) of religion is TAQIYYA (dissimulation), hence one who does not dissimulate has no religion. (Al-Kafi).The most beloved thing on the surface of Earth is TAQIYYA. (Kafi, Base provisions). The TAQIYYA has many rulings associated with it; we will mention some of them. 1) When a man is among a large group of unbelievers, and fears for his life or property from them, he can beguiles or cajoles them with his tongue. He does this by avoiding disclosure of enmity. 2) It is also permissible to produce speech that gives the impression of friendship and alliance but on condition that he internally maintain the opposite and use allusive language in all of what he says. 3) TAQIYYA is permissible with regard to displaying alliance and enmity, also with regard to disclosing ones religion. 4) The TAQIYYA is allowed before unbelievers who are dominant. However, Shafii declared that in situations, TAQIYYA becomes legal even among Muslims as a means to protect ones life. 5) TAQIYYA is permissible for the purpose of preservation of life. Is it also permissible for the preservation of property?  The Prophet said: The inviolability of a Muslims property is like the inviolability of his life.  The Prophet said also: He who is killed protecting his property is a martyr. It should also be permissible] because man has a compelling need of property. How, then, could it not be permissible here?(Razi, Tafsir) (Sura III, v. 29) Whether ye hide what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it all.. Islamic TAQIYYA is still valid? (Mujahid) The application of TAQIYYA was valid in the beginning of Islam, because of the weakness of the believers; but now that the Islamic government has got power and strength, it is not valid. (Hassan al-Basri) TAQIYYA is allowed to the Muslims up to the day of resurrection. And this opinion is more acceptable because it is a must, to keep off all types of harm from ones self as much as possible. (Razi, Tafsir) As usual in Islam, nothing is well defined. (Ibn Abbas) If any one is compelled and professes unbelief with his tongue, while his heart contradicts him, to escape his enemies, no blame falls him on him, because Allah takes Muslims as their hearts believe. (Exegesis of Tabari, Sura XVI, v. 106). (Ibn Abbas) Those who have been coerced, and as such uttered with their tongues that which their hearts did not confirm to escape punishment, have nothing to fear. Allah holds His servants responsible for that which their hearts have ratified. (Sunan al-Bayhaqi). (The Companion Ibn MASOUD) There is no speech I would not speak if it spared me two stripes from a man in power He limited the license to speech, not the acts. This is nonsense, as coercion can be in deeds and in words, in spite of the intimate faith, as told by Omar ibn al-Khattab. (Qurtobi, Tafsir the Koran, Sura XVI). In his workbook, Abdul RAZZAQ narrated that the son of Omar used the TAQIYYA with the Umayyad Caliphs. The TAQIYYA is then a legal hypocrisy in Islam, applies also to economic interests. In Islam always searched for material interests and sex. (Hassan al-Basri) For the believer, TAQIYYA is permissible until the Day of Resurrection. Dissimulation of Muslim is to be practiced to protect oneself from punishment though false declaration, while thinking otherwise. Some people refuse it saying: Its hypocrisy, but it is true that it is permissible, the Koran says: you should guard yourselves against them by TAQIYYA, guarding carefully (Sarkhassi in Mabsoot). Muslims admit that TAQIYYA is a kind of hypocrisy. It is an eternal doctrinal teaching according to the belief of Islam, exactly similar to the duty of jihad. (Ibn Abbas) Dissimulation is outward cajolery to be done towards the infidels or being among them. A Muslim dodges them with his tongue, in spite of no affection for them in his heart. (QATADA) If the infidels are dominants, or if Muslims live between unbelievers, they [Muslims] can dissimulate showing patronage to them (KAFIRS) to stave off the threat, while their heart remain firm in hatred to them, waiting the good moment to overcome them. This kind of hypocrisy is what the Muslims currently apply when they claim that Islam is a religion of peace, which is clearly a lie. They know the weakness and inability of Islam in the face of others. Conclusion The concept of TAQIYYA is eternal. TAQIYYA is allowed for protection of both life and property.A Muslim may dissimulate not only among unbelievers but also among other Muslims. Dissimulation may be applied to both words and deeds.The officialIslamic doctrine denies the possibility of using TAQIYYA when a missing the condition of grave and imminent threat to personal safety. Nonetheless, often Muslims practice this concept cunningly for proselytism in Western countries, concealing many aspects of Islam that are not shared by the majority of non-Muslims. So, TAQIYYA can be considered a form of Jihad."
62,vulnerability,The_Donald,We know about the Clinton's pharmaceutical price fixing. How far does it really go? Clinton's actions in Sub-Saharan Africa were the catalyst that reversed century-old downward trends in disease mortality rates.,8,5qjqd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5qjqd9/we_know_about_the_clintons_pharmaceutical_price/,2017-01-28 08:10:52,"TLDR - For over a year, the American Ambassador in Kenya requested additional security. - President Clinton neglected those requests. - Al Qaeda detonated a bomb that killed 12 Americans and over 200 Kenyans. Among the dead, 2 CIA operators. - In response, Clinton ordered missile strikes on a pharmaceutical factory in Sudan. - Clinton claimed the site was being used by Osama bin Laden to manufacture chemical weapons. - It wasnt. - It was just a pharmaceutical factory. This factory supplied around 50% of Sudans medicine. - Malaria mortality rates declined steadily from 1900 all the way through the 1980s. . - In the 1990s, the mortality rates skyrocketed, rising over 40%. This was caused by medication shortage. - This medication shortage was caused in large part by direct and indirect actions taken by the Clinton administration to destabilize Africa. - Not one to let a good crisis go to waste, Clinton sponsored several programs to boost spending to fight these problems. - These programs are designed to funnel money out of government, into the hands of Clinton cronies. - Clinton and large pharmaceutical companies are financially connected. - Clinical trials in third world countries are out of control. Pharmaceutical companies are taking advantage of uninformed populations in order to collect data for pipeline products.

On April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvnal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, were both killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Kigali Airport in Rwanda. Responsibility for the assassinations has never been clearly established, however, the resulting chaos was the catalyst for the masacre of Tutsis at the hands of Rwanda's Hutu majority. # She warned them. - Bushnell, who had been visiting the area just weeks before, released a memorandum immediately following the assassinations. - In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. - Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell's recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador to Kenya** - Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996.

But careful study of the target list tells another story. - Thirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait. **Bill Clinton bombed Saddam to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - what Huma Abedin's Muslim journal claimed about her boss's husband** - [DAILY MAIL](URL AUG 26, 2016 - Huma Abedin, Clinton's right-hand woman, was for 12 years the assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. - In 2002 the supposedly academic journal published claims by a Canadian law student about the 1998 bombing Bill Clinton ordered in Iraq. - Sina Ali Musati claimed he did it as a distraction from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - which was then at its height. - Clinton campaign claims Abedin was not involved in actually editing the magazine saying she was 'just on the masthead'. - But did not explain how that squared with her being on the editorial board. - Her mother is editor-in-chief and suggested U.S. was responsible for 9/11 while another article said Jews were 'adept' at influencing politics. - The article was written by Sina Ali Muscati who was the time described as a 'second year law student' at the University of Ottawa. His academic credentials were not declared. - Muscati wrote about the 1991 conflict and its aftermath, which saw Saddam Hussein remain in power throughout the 1990s, despite being bombed twice - in 1996 and in December 1998. - 'The crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited Clinton, serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises, such as his campaign funding scandals, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair,' he said. - 'By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least, he has been able to look strong and presidential.' - Clinton's bombing of Iraq in December 1998 was widely mocked as 'Monica's war'. - He ordered four days of strikes by bombers and cruise missiles at the height of his impeachment trial, brought in the wake of his admission that he had had a 'not appropriate' relationship with Monica Lewinsky. # Sound familiar?

In 2009, CHAI was invited back to partner with the South African Government to help improve the response to HIV and TB, which laid the foundation for the most aggressive expansion of HIV testing and treatment ever attempted in the world. In addition to the CHAI HIV/AIDS work, CHAI also supports the National Department of Health (NDOH) with efforts to eliminate malaria. - CHAI worked with the government to develop implementation plans for testing and treatment and to select facilities for ART scale-up. From April 2010 to March 2012, the number of facilities providing ART increased from 495 to over 3000, and in the last year close to 430,000 people started treatment. Since April 2010, nearly 20 million HIV tests were conducted in South Africa. &amp;nbsp; # CHAI UPDATE  February 2013 | [WIKILEAKS (attachment)](URL &amp;nbsp; # Industry-sponsored clinical drug trials in Egypt | [SOMO](URL | JUN 21, 2016 - The past 20 years have seen a considerable shift in the location of clinical drug trials sponsored by transnational pharmaceutical companies (TNCs), with a significant ex-pansion of such tests being conducted in low- and middle-income settings. This increased offshoring may result in serious ethical violations as highlighted by several recent field investigations and media reports. - An attractive research infrastructure, a fast-growing and largely treatment-nave population, and lower costs make Egypt among the most popular places in the Middle East and Northern Africa (MENA) region for offshoring medicine testing. **Egypt is second only to South Africa on the African continent in terms of the number of TNC-sponsored clinical trials it hosts.** - Of the 57 international drug trials that were active in Egypt in February 2016, over half were cancer trials. The two Swiss giants Novartis and Roche are responsible for almost 50 per cent of the international drug trials taking place in the country. The Arab spring events of early 2011 and the subsequent political unrest had no chilling effect on the number of active international drug trials  on the contrary. - Egypt has the highest prevalence of viral hepatitis C in the world, and was the frst low- or middle-income country in 2014 to negotiate preferential pricing for the new direct acting antiviral (DAA) treatment sofosbuvir (Sovaldi) with manufacturer Gilead. &amp;nbsp; *** &amp;nbsp; # Raymond Schinazi fled Nassers Egypt to become pioneer in antivirals | [FINANCIAL TIMES](URL | JUL 27, 2014 - He personally had a hand in discovering and developing several key treatments for HIV and hepatitis C.

This factory supplied around 50% of Sudans medicine. - Malaria mortality rates declined steadily from 1900 all the way through the 1980s. . - In the 1990s, the mortality rates skyrocketed, rising over 40%. This was caused by medication shortage. - This medication shortage was caused in large part by direct and indirect actions taken by the Clinton administration to destabilize Africa. - Not one to let a good crisis go to waste, Clinton sponsored several programs to boost spending to fight these problems. - These programs are designed to funnel money out of government, into the hands of Clinton cronies. - Clinton and large pharmaceutical companies are financially connected. - Clinical trials in third world countries are out of control.

I have included some background info on Ambassador Bushnell that some may find ""boring"" &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador Prudence Bushnell** | [**WIKIPEDIA**](URL - **Black Hawk Down** On October 3, 1993, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and 73 wounded in an attempt to apprehend warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid at the Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia. The American public was appalled at the deaths and support for American involvement in African affairs suffered as a result. - It was against this backdrop that the **Rwandan Genocide** began. On April 6, 1994, Rwandan President Juvnal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira, the President of Burundi, were both killed when their plane was shot down on approach to Kigali Airport in Rwanda. Responsibility for the assassinations has never been clearly established, however, the resulting chaos was the catalyst for the masacre of Tutsis at the hands of Rwanda's Hutu majority. # Bushnell warned the Clinton Administration in advance - Bushnell, who had been visiting the area just weeks before, released a memorandum immediately following the assassinations. - In it, she predicted widespread violence and the military take-over of the Rwandan government and urged the U.S. government to take action to maintain order. - Partly as a result of the Somali incident, the U.S. government chose not to heed Bushnell's recommendations, and on the next day, April 7, the Rwandan Genocide began when several Tutsi government officials and moderate Hutu Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana were killed by Hutu militias. # Clinton did nothing &amp;nbsp; **Ambassador to Kenya** - Bushnell remained Deputy Assistant Secretary until being nominated by President Clinton to serve as Ambassador to Kenya in 1996. Upon confirmation by the United States Senate, Bushnell took up residence in Nairobi. - Bushnell used her office to push Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to institute democratic reforms and to root out corruption in his government, a major drag on Kenya's economy. # She warned them again. - Bushnell was also alarmed at the vulnerability of the U.S. embassy compound to attack. - **For over a year, she complained about security conditions to her superiors in Washington.** - Despite Bushnell's request for a new, secure building, a State Department evaluation team concluded that a renovation would suffice. # August 7, 1998 a car bomb was detonated next to the embassy by al-Qaeda agents. &amp;nbsp; # 1998 US Embassies in Africa Bombings Fast Facts | [CNN](URL | JULY 27, 2015 - August 7, 1998 - Almost simultaneously, bombs explode at U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killing 224 people.

Interior Minister Abdul Rahim told CNN in a telephone interview that the privately owned pharmaceutical firm had ""nothing to do with chemical weapons."" - **""We have no chemical weapons factory in our country,""** he said. - A statement read on Sudanese television about an hour after the attack said, ""The wrongful American air force launched air attacks on Sudan tonight which aimed at strategic and vital areas.""

The destroyed factory has become a monument of sorts, a place that Sudanese authorities say symbolizes the mistreatment they have suffered at the hands of the world's superpower. - ""The government wants it as a showcase,"" said Eltayeb Hag Ateya, director of the Peace Studies Institute at the University of Khartoum. ""It's still a thorn in Sudan-American relations. It will always be a point for the Sudanese government to bring up."" - Well then, what was the hurry? A hurry that was panicky enough for the president and his advisors to pick the wrong objective and then, stained with embarrassment and retraction, to refuse the open inquiry that could have settled the question in the first place? There is really only one possible answer to that question. Clinton needed to look presidential for a day. &amp;nbsp; **The Observer** noted: - ""The loss of this factory is a tragedy for the rural communities who need these medicines"" quoting Tom Carnaffin, technical manager with ""intimate knowledge"" of the destroyed plant. - A month later, Guardian correspondent Patrick Wintour elaborated that the plant ""provided 50 percent of Sudans medicines, and its destruction has left the country with no supplies of chloroquine, the standard treatment for malaria"". (Wintour, Patrick, The Observer, 20 December 1998.) &amp;nbsp; He continued that, despite this, the # British government (who publicly backed the attack) refused requests ""to resupply chloroquine in emergency relief until such time as the Sudanese can rebuild their pharmaceutical production"". - The factory was a principal source of Sudan's anti-malaria and veterinary drugs according to the CBW Conventions Bulletin. | [THE CBW CONVENTIONS BULLETIN](URL &amp;nbsp; # Coincidentally Malaria Spirals Out of Control # Malaria Surveillance - United States, 1999 | [CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL](URL **Interpretation:** - The 25.5% increase in malaria cases in 1999, compared with 1998, resulted primarily from increases in cases acquired in Africa and the Americas. - This increase is possibly related to a change in the system by which states report to CDC, but it could also have resulted from local changes in disease transmission, increased travel to these regions, improved reporting to state and local health departments, or a **decreased use of effective antimalarial chemoprophylaxis.** - In the majority of reported cases, U.S. civilians who acquired infection abroad were not on an appropriate chemoprophylaxis regimen for the country where they acquired malaria. &amp;nbsp; # Public Complain of Malaria Vaccine Shortage | [GHANA WEB](URL | NOV 3, 2000 - The general public has raised concern and doubt over malaria vaccines, which they said are running short in health centres. - In an interview in health centres, members of the public expressed 'strong interest', calling for 'immediate' explanation from the health department over what they saw as the acute shortage of chloroquine vaccines at a time when malaria is taking a high toll on the population. &amp;nbsp; ### Time to act! What can USAID do for you? **United States Agency for International Development** USAID's programs are authorized by the Congress in the Foreign Assistance Act, which the Congress supplements through directions in annual funding appropriation acts and other legislation. Although it is technically an independent agency, USAID operates subject to the foreign policy guidance of the President, Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. USAID operates in Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. &amp;nbsp; # Evaluating Malaria Interventions In Africa: A Review and Assessment of Recent Research | [USAID](URL | NOV 1999 - According to the most recent data, 40% (2,400 million) of the world population in over 90 countries is affected by malaria. In any given year, nearly 10% of the global population will suffer a case of malaria (Malaria International, 1998). - There are 300 - 500 million clinical cases of malaria worldwide each year with the majority occurring in sub-Saharan Africa (WHO, 1998). - Malaria has been estimated to cause 9% of all disease in Africa (Nchinda, 1998). - According to recent data, there are 1.5  2.7 million deaths due to malaria each year, the bulk of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa where an estimated 360 million people live in areas of stable, endemic Plasmodium falciparum transmission (Snow et al., 1999a). &amp;nbsp; # Rolling Back Malaria | [WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION](URL | 1999 - Almost 300 million clinical cases of malaria occur worldwide each year and over one million people die. - Almost 90% of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where young children are the most affected. - Malaria is directly responsible for one in five childhood deaths in Africa and indirectly contributes to illness and deaths from respiratory infections, diarrheal disease and malnutrition. &amp;nbsp; **The author then uses factual information in a manner that is very misleading.** - Chloroquine, perhaps the best ever antimalarial drug, and certainly the most widely used, is now failing against falciparum malaria in most areas of the tropical world. **True** - In some areas, such as parts of South-East Asia and South America, chloroquine is now completely ineffective against P. falciparum malaria. **True, but were talking about Africa. Thats where the problem is.** - In many parts of India and Africa, its effectiveness is falling rapidly. # True, but still misleading. Per the National Center for Biotechnology (NCBI), despite declining use, CQ remained the first-line therapy for uncomplicated P.f. malaria in the majority of sub-Saharan countries until after 2000. | [US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE](URL &amp;nbsp; - For the treatment of falciparum malaria, the usual successor to chloroquine is a combination of pyrimethamine and a long acting sulphonamide (SP), which is also affordable and well tolerated. Five countries in Africa (Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland) have now been forced to switch from chloroquine to SP as the first line antimalarial treatment. - Unfortunately, in several of the areas where it has been deployed, notably South-East Asia and South America, P. falciparum has become widely SP-resistant. &amp;nbsp; I thought we were talking about sub-Saharan Africa. # The truth is, the resurgence of malaria (and AIDS) is in large part, the result of Bill Clintons destabilization of Africa. &amp;nbsp; # World Health Organization (WHO) backs controversial chemical for malaria control | [SCI DEV NET](URL | SEP 18, 2006 - The controversial insecticide DDT  which most nations have banned  is back on the menu for malaria control after the World Health Organization reversed a 30-year old policy on Friday (15 September). - The move puts annual indoor spraying of DDT alongside drugs and bednets as one of the three main tools for controlling the disease. - ""The scientific and programmatic evidence clearly supports this reassessment,"" said Anarfi Asamoa-Baah, assistant director-general for HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria at the World Health Organization (WHO). - ""[Indoor spraying] has proven to be just as cost-effective as other malaria prevention methods, and DDT presents no health risk when used properly."" - The chemical kills the mosquitoes that spread malaria. It helped eradicate the disease from southern Europe and North America in the 1960s. - DDT is also toxic to birds, fish and mammals. It accumulates in the food chain and remains in the environment for many years. In the 1970s, growing awareness of these threats led many countries to ban its use in agriculture. &amp;nbsp; # Malaria linked to catastrophic spread of AIDS in Africa | [SCI DEV NET](URL | DEC 8, 2006 - Research in Kenya indicates that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS across Africa could be linked to malaria. - The work has important implications for public health policies in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need to tackle both diseases together. - There is considerable geographical overlap between HIV/AIDS  which infects over 40 million people in Africa  and malaria, which causes 500 million clinical infections each year. - People with both malaria and HIV/AIDS are more likely to transmit the HIV virus, according to the study published in the journal Science today (8 December).

Hayden and Ashcroft made clear in private meetings that the president wanted to detect possible terrorist activity before another attack. They also made clear that, in such a broad hunt for suspicious patterns and activities, the government could never meet the FISA court's probable-cause requirement, government officials said. # Townsend is a liar. # SECRET COURT SAYS FBI MISLED JUDGES IN 75 CASES | [NEW YORK TIMES](URL | AUG 23, 2002 - The nation's secret intelligence court has identified more than 75 cases in which it says it was misled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in documents in which the bureau attempted to justify its need for wiretaps and other electronic surveillance, according to the first of the court's rulings to be released publicly. - In its opinion, the court rejected a secret request made by the Justice Department this year to allow broader cooperation and evidence-sharing between counterintelligence investigators and criminal prosecutors. - FBI. and the Justice Department tried to defy the will of Congress by allowing intelligence material to be shared freely with criminal investigators. - The standards of evidence required for electronic surveillance are much lower in many intelligence investigations than in criminal investigations, the authors of the law wanted to prevent the dissemination of intelligence information to criminal investigators or prosecutors. - In a number of cases the FBI and the Justice Department had made ''erroneous statements'' in eavesdropping applications about ''the separation of the overlapping intelligence and criminal investigators and the **unauthorized sharing of FISA information with FBI criminal investigators and assistant U.S. attorneys.**'' - The court said that the FBI and the Justice Department were violating the law by allowing information gathered from intelligence eavesdrops to be used freely in bringing criminal charges, without court review, and that criminal investigators were improperly directing the use of counterintelligence wiretaps. - In one case, it said, the error appeared in a statement **issued by the office of Louis J. Freeh, then the FBI director, in which the bureau said that target of an intelligence eavesdropping request ''was not under criminal investigation.''** - In March of 2001, the court said, ''the government reported similar misstatements in another series of FISA applications in which there was **supposed to be a 'wall' between separate intelligence and criminal squads in FBI field offices to screen FISA intercepts**, when in fact **all of the FBI agents were on the same squad and all of the screening was done by the one supervisor overseeing both investigations.** &amp;nbsp; # Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts | [NEW YORK TIMES](URL | DEC 16, 2005 - Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government officials. - The previously undisclosed decision to permit some eavesdropping inside the country without court approval was a major shift in American intelligence-gathering practices, particularly for the National Security Agency, whose mission is to spy on communications abroad. - Nearly a dozen current and former officials, who were granted anonymity because of the classified nature of the program, discussed it with reporters for The New York Times because of their concerns about the operation's legality and oversight. - **Administration officials are confident that existing safeguards are sufficient to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.** - **The White House asked The New York Times not to publish this article, arguing that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would-be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny.** - President Bush significantly eased limits on American intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the military. - The NSA breaks codes and maintains listening posts around the world to eavesdrop on foreign governments, diplomats and trade negotiators as well as drug lords and terrorists. - Traditionally, the FBI, not the NSA, seeks such warrants and conducts most domestic eavesdropping. Until the new program began, the N.S.A. typically limited its domestic surveillance to foreign embassies and missions in Washington, New York and other cities, and obtained court orders to do so. - **Since 2002, the agency has been conducting some warrantless eavesdropping on people in the United States.** &amp;nbsp; # An Outsider's Quick Rise To Bush Terror Adviser  Frances Townsend | [WASHINGTON POST](URL | AUG 27, 2005 - She rushed through American University in three years. - She became a key adviser to Janet Reno. - Early work on mob cases led Rudolph W.

At the time, the Coast Guard was not part of the intelligence community and thus was not allowed to share sensitive information. - She helped the Coast Guard get added to intelligence legislation and transformed the agency's priority from South American drug-smuggling to the vulnerability of America's ports. - In Spring of 2003, Richard Clarke and General John A Gordon (Bushs Homeland Security Chief) lobbied for Townsend, and as a result she was hired on to the **National Security Council.** &amp;nbsp; - **Frances Townsend runs President Bush's far-flung campaign against terrorism.** - **""She obviously has the confidence of the president, and that has a huge impact on her ability to influence the process,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.** &amp;nbsp; - **She is the coordinator, the facilitator, the bridge, as FBI Director Robert S.

As the gatekeeper for intelligence wiretap requests**, Townsend's office fought efforts to invoke the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in matters that could result in criminal cases, fearing that prosecutors would use such surveillance to circumvent the more difficult threshold for obtaining a criminal wiretap. **In practical terms, the result was what commission reports called ""The Wall,"" fencing off investigators from potentially useful information about suspects on American soil.** - In an example cited by a bipartisan congressional commission, Townsend refused to endorse a secret intelligence wiretap on Los Alamos National Laboratories scientist Wen Ho Lee because the FBI's interest in the case was ""way too criminal."" &amp;nbsp; # FBI Announces Restructuring | [FBI](URL | JUL 26, 2006 - Director Robert S.

Mueller also named a longtime agent to fill a new position of associate deputy director, but he created three positions that he filled with bureau employees who made their mark elsewhere: - **Donald E.

68,vulnerability,The_Donald,"Will Donald Trump help stop the MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way) movement, or will marriage/birth rates continue to decline thanks to feminism, Hollywood, and liberalism?",16,5knq0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5knq0u/will_donald_trump_help_stop_the_mgtow_men_going/,2016-12-28 13:22:47,"Milo Yiannopoulos calls it ""The Sexodus,"" though it's more commonly known as MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way). Basically, this is a movement where men aged 18 and older have given up on women and refuse to get married or even start a relationship. There are several reasons as to why men in this country (and in other western nations) are avoiding commitment, but the main reason lies in the dark side of marriage: divorce. Men have realized that the family courts are NOT in their favor. Depending on each U.S. state, 5o to 60 percent of marriages end in divorce. 70 to 80 percent of them are initiated by the wife. And it's most unfortunate when 90 to 95 percent of the time, it's the ex-wife who gets to keep the house, the children, the cars, the pets, and the furniture. Meanwhile, the ex-husband is forced out of his home and has to stay in a studio apartment eating nothing but ramen noodles and cheese sandwiches for the rest of his life, because a huge chunk of his income is spent on both alimony and child support. He can only see his kids on weekends, or worse, once a month. And if he can't make his alimony payments in time, he will go to jail. Men have seen this happen to either their father, their uncle, their brother, their cousin, or their best friend. And they see that marriage is not worth it anymore. The risks are many and the benefits are limited. There are many other factors that have led to this movement: fear of false rape accusations, the confusing and worthless ""Yes Means Yes"" consent laws in universities, fear of losing respect when becoming a father/husband thanks to mainstream media crapping on anything that has to do with straight males, and constant rejections from women who said they wanted a ""Nice Guy"" but in reality are attracted to ""Bad Boys."" The last one is really significant, because men have been taught since High School that in order to find a woman to love and cherish forever, they must always be nice and gentle, and always put her on a pedestal. This, in turn, isn't exactly true, as there are tons of men out there who have been rejected by women who were turned off by his visible vulnerability and complete lack of testosterone. Here's another factor. Men are complaining that ""women aren't women anymore."" This means that some women have avoided their traditional gender roles. For example, they shun motherhood and become complete sex objects. Think of it, there are women out there who are not afraid of showing off their sluttiness. They are actually proud of having slept with over fifty guys in their lifetime, even if STD's have affected their genitalia. No guy wants to marry her. She's damaged goods at this point. Am I saying that a women's place is in the home? No, of course not. A woman has the freedom to become whatever she wants to be. It's a free country after all. I am not against their willingness to choose which life they lead. The consequences, however, are really pulling our western nations apart. Since 2013, men have waken up and have discovered that society heavily favors the female. Below are the YouTube videos that can explain this better than I can. Terrence Popp - What is MGTOW? URL Karen Straughan - Men Not Marrying, How Deep Does The Problem Go? URL Paul Joseph Watson - Why Men Are Frightened of Marriage? URL Pastor Dowell - Why Men Are Not Marrying Today URL Computing Forever - Just Go MGTOW? Wolf-whistling Now A Hate Crime URL Sargon of Akkad - Sean Hannity vs. Women's Declining Happiness URL PJ Media (with Helen Smith) - The Real Reasons Why Men Are Shunning Marriage URL So basically, fear of divorce, fear of false rape accusations, refusal to live up to Hollywood's standards of the typical beta male father/husband, and constant failures with potential girlfriends are what led to this MGTOW movement. Men have given up. They are now refusing to get married, and most are refusing to have a girlfriend. They are just content with porn, video games, and Netflix. There is absolutely nothing wrong with those things, but it is indeed troubling. Most of them have stopped becoming ambitious, and do not want to become CEO's or athletes or whatever. They only have themselves to take care of, so why earn that much money if they'll never have a wife and kids? But anyway, where does all of this lead up to? With the MGTOW movement going stronger every year, this is one of the major reasons why western civilization is crumbling. Birth rates are still declining in abysmally low levels. Liberal policies are making men and women distrust each other even more. Hollywood continues to keep the ""incompetent father"" stereotype alive and well in films and TV shows. And the worst part of this is that MGTOW men (not all, but some) just don't care about our civilization anymore. They don't care if America collapses just like Ancient Rome. While I don't agree with their cold-hearted attitude, I can still see why they are feeling this way. With modern society completing ignoring men's issues, what's the point? Donald J. Trump has a big obstacle in front of him. He is up against a family court that only cares about women. He is up against Hollywood, a place where people continue to put fathers and husbands in a negative light. He is up against colleges and universities that still favor feminism over men's rights. He is up against certain liberals who strongly oppose traditional marriages and gender roles and have the power to spread this ideology around. Trump can at least help shrink the MGTOW movement by helping other people turn everything around. The only way that marriage can be fully attractive again is to help change family laws and such. Plus, Trump's image can provide more motivation for men of all ages. People are sick and tired of seeing male characters in film and TV acting like complete idiots. Not everyone has to be like Homer Simpson or Ray Barone. When Trump is in office, his charisma and intelligence might inspire men to not give up and become ambitious once again. He can become the positive male role model that we men have been desperately searching for. But it's going to take a long time before we can make marriage great again. We have broken everything that was good about marriage, and we will have to wait for a few more years until birth rates in western countries can rise again. While I do understand why men are Going Their Own Way, I don't want to see America fail. TL;DR Men have given up on marriage and relationships, and have become MGTOW. Birth rates and marriage rates will continue to decline in western countries thanks to feminism, family courts, Hollywood, and the ""Nice Guy"" myth. This could eventually cause the collapse of America and Europe. Donald J. Trump has one big obstacle in front of him, and in order to Make America Great Again, we must Make Marriage &amp; Relationships Great Again."

But careful study of the target list tells another story. - Thirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait. **Bill Clinton bombed Saddam to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - what Huma Abedin's Muslim journal claimed about her boss's husband** - [DAILY MAIL](URL AUG 26, 2016 - Huma Abedin, Clinton's right-hand woman, was for 12 years the assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. - In 2002 the supposedly academic journal published claims by a Canadian law student about the 1998 bombing Bill Clinton ordered in Iraq. - Sina Ali Musati claimed he did it as a distraction from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - which was then at its height. - Clinton campaign claims Abedin was not involved in actually editing the magazine saying she was 'just on the masthead'. - But did not explain how that squared with her being on the editorial board. - Her mother is editor-in-chief and suggested U.S. was responsible for 9/11 while another article said Jews were 'adept' at influencing politics. - The article was written by Sina Ali Muscati who was the time described as a 'second year law student' at the University of Ottawa. His academic credentials were not declared. - Muscati wrote about the 1991 conflict and its aftermath, which saw Saddam Hussein remain in power throughout the 1990s, despite being bombed twice - in 1996 and in December 1998. - 'The crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited Clinton, serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises, such as his campaign funding scandals, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair,' he said. - 'By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least, he has been able to look strong and presidential.' - Clinton's bombing of Iraq in December 1998 was widely mocked as 'Monica's war'. - He ordered four days of strikes by bombers and cruise missiles at the height of his impeachment trial, brought in the wake of his admission that he had had a 'not appropriate' relationship with Monica Lewinsky. # Sound familiar?

But careful study of the target list tells another story. - Thirty-five of the 100 targets were selected because of their role in Iraq's air defense system, an essential first step in any air war, because damage to those sites paves the way for other forces and minimizes casualties all around. Only 13 targets on the list are facilities associated with chemical and biological weapons or ballistic missiles, and three are southern Republican Guard bases that might be involved in a repeat invasion of Kuwait. **Bill Clinton bombed Saddam to distract from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - what Huma Abedin's Muslim journal claimed about her boss's husband** - [DAILY MAIL](URL AUG 26, 2016 - Huma Abedin, Clinton's right-hand woman, was for 12 years the assistant editor of the Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs. - In 2002 the supposedly academic journal published claims by a Canadian law student about the 1998 bombing Bill Clinton ordered in Iraq. - Sina Ali Musati claimed he did it as a distraction from the Monica Lewinsky scandal - which was then at its height. - Clinton campaign claims Abedin was not involved in actually editing the magazine saying she was 'just on the masthead'. - But did not explain how that squared with her being on the editorial board. - Her mother is editor-in-chief and suggested U.S. was responsible for 9/11 while another article said Jews were 'adept' at influencing politics. - The article was written by Sina Ali Muscati who was the time described as a 'second year law student' at the University of Ottawa. His academic credentials were not declared. - Muscati wrote about the 1991 conflict and its aftermath, which saw Saddam Hussein remain in power throughout the 1990s, despite being bombed twice - in 1996 and in December 1998. - 'The crisis with Iraq has also probably benefited Clinton, serving as a good deterrent of attention from personal crises, such as his campaign funding scandals, legislative failures, or the Monica Lewinsky affair,' he said. - 'By occasionally bombing Iraq in the name of humanity, at least, he has been able to look strong and presidential.' - Clinton's bombing of Iraq in December 1998 was widely mocked as 'Monica's war'. - He ordered four days of strikes by bombers and cruise missiles at the height of his impeachment trial, brought in the wake of his admission that he had had a 'not appropriate' relationship with Monica Lewinsky. # Sound familiar?

How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) 5. Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression ______________________________________________________________________________________ COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet forum. There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.' Technique #1 - 'FORUM SLIDING' If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum - it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon, to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a 'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then 'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items. Technique #2 - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING' A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the time at URL is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence' or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a 'forum slide.' Technique #3 - 'TOPIC DILUTION' Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues. This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt (trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in. It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator. Technique #4 - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION' Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon' and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have. In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop them from their activities. Technique #5 - 'ANGER TROLLING' Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are, it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video. This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during prosecution. Technique #6 - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL' It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed. However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your agenda purposes. CONCLUSION - Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy or conspiracy to cover up. 1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know, don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor, etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal with the issues. 2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the 'How dare you!' gambit. 3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges, regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a 'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis in fact. 4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues. 5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues. 6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism, reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify the opponent's viewpoint. 7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive. 8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources. 9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect. 10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man -- usually, in any large-scale matter of high visibility, someone will make charges early on which can be or were already easily dealt with - a kind of investment for the future should the matter not be so easily contained.) Where it can be foreseen, have your own side raise a straw man issue and have it dealt with early on as part of the initial contingency plans. Subsequent charges, regardless of validity or new ground uncovered, can usually then be associated with the original charge and dismissed as simply being a rehash without need to address current issues -- so much the better where the opponent is or was involved with the original source. 11. Establish and rely upon fall-back positions. Using a minor matter or element of the facts, take the 'high road' and 'confess' with candor that some innocent mistake, in hindsight, was made -- but that opponents have seized on the opportunity to blow it all out of proportion and imply greater criminalities which, 'just isn't so.' Others can reinforce this on your behalf, later, and even publicly 'call for an end to the nonsense' because you have already 'done the right thing.' Done properly, this can garner sympathy and respect for 'coming clean' and 'owning up' to your mistakes without addressing more serious issues. 12. Enigmas have no solution. Drawing upon the overall umbrella of events surrounding the crime and the multitude of players and events, paint the entire affair as too complex to solve. This causes those otherwise following the matter to begin to lose interest more quickly without having to address the actual issues. 13. Alice in Wonderland Logic. Avoid discussion of the issues by reasoning backwards or with an apparent deductive logic which forbears any actual material fact. 14. Demand complete solutions. Avoid the issues by requiring opponents to solve the crime at hand completely, a ploy which works best with issues qualifying for rule 10. 15. Fit the facts to alternate conclusions. This requires creative thinking unless the crime was planned with contingency conclusions in place. 16. Vanish evidence and witnesses. If it does not exist, it is not fact, and you won't have to address the issue. 17. Change the subject. Usually in connection with one of the other ploys listed here, find a way to side-track the discussion with abrasive or controversial comments in hopes of turning attention to a new, more manageable topic. This works especially well with companions who can 'argue' with you over the new topic and polarize the discussion arena in order to avoid discussing more key issues. 18. Emotionalize, Antagonize, and Goad Opponents. If you can't do anything else, chide and taunt your opponents and draw them into emotional responses which will tend to make them look foolish and overly motivated, and generally render their material somewhat less coherent. Not only will you avoid discussing the issues in the first instance, but even if their emotional response addresses the issue, you can further avoid the issues by then focusing on how 'sensitive they are to criticism.' 19. Ignore proof presented, demand impossible proofs. This is perhaps a variant of the 'play dumb' rule. Regardless of what material may be presented by an opponent in public forums, claim the material irrelevant and demand proof that is impossible for the opponent to come by (it may exist, but not be at his disposal, or it may be something which is known to be safely destroyed or withheld, such as a murder weapon.) In order to completely avoid discussing issues, it may be required that you to categorically deny and be critical of media or books as valid sources, deny that witnesses are acceptable, or even deny that statements made by government or other authorities have any meaning or relevance. 20. False evidence. Whenever possible, introduce new facts or clues designed and manufactured to conflict with opponent presentations -- as useful tools to neutralize sensitive issues or impede resolution. This works best when the crime was designed with contingencies for the purpose, and the facts cannot be easily separated from the fabrications. 21. Call a Grand Jury, Special Prosecutor, or other empowered investigative body. Subvert the (process) to your benefit and effectively neutralize all sensitive issues without open discussion. Once convened, the evidence and testimony are required to be secret when properly handled. For instance, if you own the prosecuting attorney, it can insure a Grand Jury hears no useful evidence and that the evidence is sealed and unavailable to subsequent investigators. Once a favorable verdict is achieved, the matter can be considered officially closed. Usually, this technique is applied to find the guilty innocent, but it can also be used to obtain charges when seeking to frame a victim. 22. Manufacture a new truth. Create your own expert(s), group(s), author(s), leader(s) or influence existing ones willing to forge new ground via scientific, investigative, or social research or testimony which concludes favorably. In this way, if you must actually address issues, you can do so authoritatively. 23. Create bigger distractions. If the above does not seem to be working to distract from sensitive issues, or to prevent unwanted media coverage of unstoppable events such as trials, create bigger news stories (or treat them as such) to distract the multitudes. 24. Silence critics. If the above methods do not prevail, consider removing opponents from circulation by some definitive solution so that the need to address issues is removed entirely. This can be by their death, arrest and detention, blackmail or destruction of their character by release of blackmail information, or merely by destroying them financially, emotionally, or severely damaging their health. 25. Vanish. If you are a key holder of secrets or otherwise overly illuminated and you think the heat is getting too hot, to avoid the issues, vacate the kitchen. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Eight Traits of the Disinformationalist 1) Avoidance. They never actually discuss issues head-on or provide constructive input, generally avoiding citation of references or credentials. Rather, they merely imply this, that, and the other. Virtually everything about their presentation implies their authority and expert knowledge in the matter without any further justification for credibility. 2) Selectivity. They tend to pick and choose opponents carefully, either applying the hit-and-run approach against mere commentators supportive of opponents, or focusing heavier attacks on key opponents who are known to directly address issues. Should a commentator become argumentative with any success, the focus will shift to include the commentator as well. 3) Coincidental. They tend to surface suddenly and somewhat coincidentally with a new controversial topic with no clear prior record of participation in general discussions in the particular public arena involved. They likewise tend to vanish once the topic is no longer of general concern. They were likely directed or elected to be there for a reason, and vanish with the reason. 4) Teamwork. They tend to operate in self-congratulatory and complementary packs or teams. Of course, this can happen naturally in any public forum, but there will likely be an ongoing pattern of frequent exchanges of this sort where professionals are involved. Sometimes one of the players will infiltrate the opponent camp to become a source for straw man or other tactics designed to dilute opponent presentation strength. 5) Anti-conspiratorial. They almost always have disdain for 'conspiracy theorists' and, usually, for those who in any way believe JFK was not killed by LHO. Ask yourself why, if they hold such disdain for conspiracy theorists, do they focus on defending a single topic discussed in a NG focusing on conspiracies? One might think they would either be trying to make fools of everyone on every topic, or simply ignore the group they hold in such disdain.Or, one might more rightly conclude they have an ulterior motive for their actions in going out of their way to focus as they do. 6) Artificial Emotions. An odd kind of 'artificial' emotionalism and an unusually thick skin -- an ability to persevere and persist even in the face of overwhelming criticism and unacceptance. This likely stems from intelligence community training that, no matter how condemning the evidence, deny everything, and never become emotionally involved or reactive. The net result for a disinfo artist is that emotions can seem artificial. Most people, if responding in anger, for instance, will express their animosity throughout their rebuttal. But disinfo types usually have trouble maintaining the 'image' and are hot and cold with respect to pretended emotions and their usually more calm or unemotional communications style. It's just a job, and they often seem unable to 'act their role in character' as well in a communications medium as they might be able in a real face-to-face conversation/confrontation. You might have outright rage and indignation one moment, ho-hum the next, and more anger later -- an emotional yo-yo. With respect to being thick-skinned, no amount of criticism will deter them from doing their job, and they will generally continue their old disinfo patterns without any adjustments to criticisms of how obvious it is that they play that game -- where a more rational individual who truly cares what others think might seek to improve their communications style, substance, and so forth, or simply give up. 7) Inconsistent. There is also a tendency to make mistakes which betray their true self/motives. This may stem from not really knowing their topic, or it may be somewhat 'freudian', so to speak, in that perhaps they really root for the side of truth deep within. I have noted that often, they will simply cite contradictory information which neutralizes itself and the author. For instance, one such player claimed to be a Navy pilot, but blamed his poor communicating skills (spelling, grammar, incoherent style) on having only a grade-school education. I'm not aware of too many Navy pilots who don't have a college degree. Another claimed no knowledge of a particular topic/situation but later claimed first-hand knowledge of it. 8) Time Constant. Recently discovered, with respect to News Groups, is the response time factor. There are three ways this can be seen to work, especially when the government or other empowered player is involved in a cover up operation: a) ANY NG posting by a targeted proponent for truth can result in an IMMEDIATE response. The government and other empowered players can afford to pay people to sit there and watch for an opportunity to do some damage. SINCE DISINFO IN A NG ONLY WORKS IF THE READER SEES IT - FAST RESPONSE IS CALLED FOR, or the visitor may be swayed towards truth. b) When dealing in more direct ways with a disinformationalist, such as email, DELAY IS CALLED FOR - there will usually be a minimum of a 48-72 hour delay. This allows a sit-down team discussion on response strategy for best effect, and even enough time to 'get permission' or instruction from a formal chain of command. c) In the NG example 1) above, it will often ALSO be seen that bigger guns are drawn and fired after the same 48-72 hours delay - the team approach in play. This is especially true when the targeted truth seeker or their comments are considered more important with respect to potential to reveal truth. Thus, a serious truth sayer will be attacked twice for the same sin. ______________________________________________________________________________________ How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent) One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. Saboteurs Some saboteurs pretend to be activists. She or he will: 1) Write encyclopedic flyers (in the present day, websites) 2) Print flyers in English only. 3) Have demonstrations in places where no one cares. 4) Solicit funding from rich people instead of grass roots support 5) Display banners with too many words that are confusing. 6) Confuse issues. 7) Make the wrong demands. 8) Compromise the goal. 9) Have endless discussions that waste everyone's time. The agent may accompany the endless discussions with drinking, pot smoking or other amusement to slow down the activist's work. Provocateurs 1) Want to establish ""leaders"" to set them up for a fall in order to stop the movement. 2) Suggest doing foolish, illegal things to get the activists in trouble. 3) Encourage militancy. 4) Want to taunt the authorities. 5) Attempt to make the activist compromise their values. 6) Attempt to instigate violence. Activisim ought to always be non-violent. 7) Attempt to provoke revolt among people who are ill-prepared to deal with the reaction of the authorities to such violence. Informants 1) Want everyone to sign up and sing in and sign everything. 2) Ask a lot of questions (gathering data). 3) Want to know what events the activist is planning to attend. 4) Attempt to make the activist defend him or herself to identify his or her beliefs, goals, and level of committment. Recruiting Legitimate activists do not subject people to hours of persuasive dialog. Their actions, beliefs, and goals speak for themselves. Groups that DO recruit are missionaries, military, and fake political parties or movements set up by agents. Surveillance ALWAYS assume that you are under surveillance. At this point, if you are NOT under surveillance, you are not a very good activist! Scare Tactics They use them. Such tactics include slander, defamation, threats, getting close to disaffected or minimally committed fellow activists to persuade them (via psychological tactics described above) to turn against the movement and give false testimony against their former compatriots. They will plant illegal substances on the activist and set up an arrest; they will plant false information and set up ""exposure,"" they will send incriminating letters [emails] in the name of the activist; and more; they will do whatever society will allow. This booklet in no way covers all the ways agents use to sabotage the lives of sincere an dedicated activists. If an agent is ""exposed,"" he or she will be transferred or replaced. COINTELPRO is still in operation today under a different code name. It is no longer placed on paper where it can be discovered through the freedom of information act. The FBI counterintelligence program's stated purpose: To expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit, and otherwise neutralize individuals who the FBI categorize as opposed to the National Interests. ""National Security"" means the FBI's security from the people ever finding out the vicious things it does in violation of people's civil liberties. ______________________________________________________________________________________ Seventeen Techniques for Truth Suppression Strong, credible allegations of high-level criminal activity can bring down a government. When the government lacks an effective, fact-based defense, other techniques must be employed. The success of these techniques depends heavily upon a cooperative, compliant press and a mere token opposition party. 1. Dummy up. If it's not reported, if it's not news, it didn't happen. 2. Wax indignant. This is also known as the ""How dare you?"" gambit. 3. Characterize the charges as ""rumors"" or, better yet, ""wild rumors."" If, in spite of the news blackout, the public is still able to learn about the suspicious facts, it can only be through ""rumors."" (If they tend to believe the ""rumors"" it must be because they are simply ""paranoid"" or ""hysterical."") 4. Knock down straw men. Deal only with the weakest aspects of the weakest charges. Even better, create your own straw men. Make up wild rumors (or plant false stories) and give them lead play when you appear to debunk all the charges, real and fanciful alike. 5. Call the skeptics names like ""conspiracy theorist,"" ""nutcase,"" ""ranter,"" ""kook,"" ""crackpot,"" and, of course, ""rumor monger."" Be sure, too, to use heavily loaded verbs and adjectives when characterizing their charges and defending the ""more reasonable"" government and its defenders. You must then carefully avoid fair and open debate with any of the people you have thus maligned. For insurance, set up your own ""skeptics"" to shoot down. 6. Impugn motives. Attempt to marginalize the critics by suggesting strongly that they are not really interested in the truth but are simply pursuing a partisan political agenda or are out to make money (compared to over-compensated adherents to the government line who, presumably, are not). 7. Invoke authority. Here the controlled press and the sham opposition can be very useful. 8. Dismiss the charges as ""old news."" 9. Come half-clean. This is also known as ""confession and avoidance"" or ""taking the limited hangout route."" This way, you create the impression of candor and honesty while you admit only to relatively harmless, less-than-criminal ""mistakes."" This stratagem often requires the embrace of a fall-back position quite different from the one originally taken. With effective damage control, the fall-back position need only be peddled by stooge skeptics to carefully limited markets. 10. Characterize the crimes as impossibly complex and the truth as ultimately unknowable. 11. Reason backward, using the deductive method with a vengeance. With thoroughly rigorous deduction, troublesome evidence is irrelevant. E.g. We have a completely free press. If evidence exists that the Vince Foster ""suicide"" note was forged, they would have reported it. They haven't reported it so there is no such evidence. Another variation on this theme involves the likelihood of a conspiracy leaker and a press who would report the leak. 12. Require the skeptics to solve the crime completely. E.g. If Foster was murdered, who did it and why? 13. Change the subject. This technique includes creating and/or publicizing distractions. 14. Lightly report incriminating facts, and then make nothing of them. This is sometimes referred to as ""bump and run"" reporting. 15. Baldly and brazenly lie. A favorite way of doing this is to attribute the ""facts"" furnished the public to a plausible-sounding, but anonymous, source. 16. Expanding further on numbers 4 and 5, have your own stooges ""expose"" scandals and champion popular causes. Their job is to pre-empt real opponents and to play 99-yard football. A variation is to pay rich people for the job who will pretend to spend their own money. 17. Flood the Internet with agents. This is the answer to the question, ""What could possibly motivate a person to spend hour upon hour on Internet news groups defending the government and/or the press and harassing genuine critics?"" Don't the authorities have defenders enough in all the newspapers, magazines, radio, and television? One would think refusing to print critical letters and screening out serious callers or dumping them from radio talk shows would be control enough, but, obviously, it is not."

77,vulnerability,The_Donald,How to Spot a Spy (Cointelpro Agent),11,5g5g5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5g5g5g/how_to_spot_a_spy_cointelpro_agent/,2016-12-03 07:09:53,"One way to neutralize a potential activist is to get them to be in a group that does all the wrong things. Why? 1) The message doesn't get out. 2) A lot of time is wasted 3) The activist is frustrated and discouraged 4) Nothing good is accomplished. FBI and Police Informers and Infiltrators will infest any group and they have phoney activist organizations established. Their purpose is to prevent any real movement for justice or eco-peace from developing in this country. Agents come in small, medium or large. They can be of any ethnic background. They can be male or female. The actual size of the group or movement being infiltrated is irrelevant. It is the potential the movement has for becoming large which brings on the spies and saboteurs. This booklet lists tactics agents use to slow things down, foul things up, destroy the movement and keep tabs on activists. It is the agent's job to keep the activist from quitting such a group, thus keeping him/her under control. In some situations, to get control, the agent will tell the activist: ""You're dividing the movement."" [Here, I have added the psychological reasons as to WHY this maneuver works to control people] This invites guilty feelings. Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of ""dedication to the cause."" Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that ""on purpose."" It's amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: ""they did that unconsciously... they didn't really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting "" and so on and so forth. The agent will tell the activist: ""You're a leader!"" This is designed to enhance the activist's self-esteem. His or her narcissistic admiration of his/her own activist/altruistic intentions increase as he or she identifies with and consciously admires the altruistic declarations of the agent which are deliberately set up to mirror those of the activist. This is ""malignant pseudoidentification."" It is the process by which the agent consciously imitates or simulates a certain behavior to foster the activist's identification with him/her, thus increasing the activist's vulnerability to exploitation. The agent will simulate the more subtle self-concepts of the activist. Activists and those who have altruistic self-concepts are most vulnerable to malignant pseudoidentification especially during work with the agent when the interaction includes matter relating to their competency, autonomy, or knowledge. The goal of the agent is to increase the activist's general empathy for the agent through pseudo-identification with the activist's self-concepts. The most common example of this is the agent who will compliment the activist for his competency or knowledge or value to the movement. On a more subtle level, the agent will simulate affects and mannerisms of the activist which promotes identification via mirroring and feelings of ""twinship"". It is not unheard of for activists, enamored by the perceived helpfulness and competence of a good agent, to find themselves considering ethical violations and perhaps, even illegal behavior, in the service of their agent/handler. The activist's ""felt quality of perfection"" [self-concept] is enhanced, and a strong empathic bond is developed with the agent through his/her imitation and simulation of the victim's own narcissistic investments. [self-concepts] That is, if the activist knows, deep inside, their own dedication to the cause, they will project that onto the agent who is ""mirroring"" them. The activist will be deluded into thinking that the agent shares this feeling of identification and bonding. In an activist/social movement setting, the adversarial roles that activists naturally play vis a vis the establishment/government, fosters ongoing processes of intrapsychic splitting so that ""twinship alliances"" between activist and agent may render whole sectors or reality testing unavailable to the activist. They literally ""lose touch with reality."" Activists who deny their own narcissistic investments [do not have a good idea of their own self-concepts and that they ARE concepts] and consciously perceive themselves (accurately, as it were) to be ""helpers"" endowed with a special amount of altruism are exceedingly vulnerable to the affective (emotional) simulation of the accomplished agent. Empathy is fostered in the activist through the expression of quite visible affects. The presentation of tearfulness, sadness, longing, fear, remorse, and guilt, may induce in the helper-oriented activist a strong sense of compassion, while unconsciously enhancing the activist's narcissistic investment in self as the embodiment of goodness. The agent's expresssion of such simulated affects may be quite compelling to the observer and difficult to distinguish from deep emotion. It can usually be identified by two events, however: First, the activist who has analyzed his/her own narcissistic roots and is aware of his/her own potential for being ""emotionally hooked,"" will be able to remain cool and unaffected by such emotional outpourings by the agent. As a result of this unaffected, cool, attitude, the Second event will occur: The agent will recompensate much too quickly following such an affective expression leaving the activist with the impression that ""the play has ended, the curtain has fallen,"" and the imposture, for the moment, has finished. The agent will then move quickly to another activist/victim. The fact is, the movement doesn't need leaders, it needs MOVERS. ""Follow the leader"" is a waste of time. A good agent will want to meet as often as possible. He or she will talk a lot and say little. One can expect an onslaught of long, unresolved discussions. Some agents take on a pushy, arrogant, or defensive manner: 1) To disrupt the agenda 2) To side-track the discussion 3) To interrupt repeatedly 4) To feign ignorance 5) To make an unfounded accusation against a person. Calling someone a racist, for example. This tactic is used to discredit a person in the eyes of all other group members. "

The South China Sea 'face off' is different. I think China will dig in their heels and if they continue to claim water, reefs islands that are clearly not theirs, we might have a war.

Just maybe the fact that we were on to the vulnerability of voting machines before the election, may have influenced them to decide that they could win without rigging due to all the illegal votes by felons, dead people, and illegal immigrants. I don't know if their recount agenda was planned before the election just in case or it was something they came up on the fly at the Soros meetings. Either way, by triggering this recount and knowing that it isn't going to change the results could be more than to just an attempt at discrediting Trump's Presidency, but also as an attempt to discredit any future recount efforts, giving them the ability to rig machines in the future. After this epic fail at a recount, one that Republicans decried so heavily, any future talk about vote rigging and recounts by Republicans will be considered hypocritical in public opinion. We need to pass strict voter id laws in the next 4 years and the machines need to updated with the source code distributed to select independent watchdogs. "

Dr. Stein continues to express the need for voting results that can be verified, and for election audits to prove that ALL votes are counted. Her visit was timed to coincide with the Federal Hearing in Philadelphia, in which we are asking for a recount of the entire state as a matter of constitutional guarantees of free and fair elections. Jill also explained the blatant continuation of electoral Jim Crow through the Michigan recount. It turns out that in Detroit and Flint there are over 75,000 ballots where voters appeared, but cast NO vote for ANY presidential candidate. This is glaring on its face, and surely demonstrates why a recount is needed there, yet those very ballots have been declared ineligible for recounting. Dr. Stein called this outrageous and vowed to fight as long as needed to see these issues addressed and resolved. Despite the cold and raw weather in Philadelphia, Jill was surrounded by the warmth and support of about 50 supporters. In a three hours-long hearing on Friday, the Jill Stein Recount legal team presented our case for forensic examination of voting machines in Pennsylvania. Our attorneys were supported by a packed courtroom of observers. There were so many there that about 2 dozen waited in the hallway outside for seat to become available inside the courtroom. Cyber expert, Professor J. Alexander Halderman testified on the issues of vulnerability and unreliability of electronic voting equipment. Considering the late stage of the process, we are most hopeful for a decision which will allow a sample of the various machines to be properly tested. Our lawyers were wonderful in court despite being opposed by lawyers for the Commonwealth and for the Republican Party. We are asking all volunteers to be prepared in the event of a favorable decision. Should that happen, we will need to deploy observers to any areas being counted. Meanwhile, the final county-level recount has been in full swing since Thursday afternoon in Chester County. Volunteers in Chester worked until 8pm on Friday, and there is a full day of counting scheduled for today. Chester may wrap up today, but, if not, then we would expect it to finish by Monday. If you are interested in helping in Chester County, please email Jenyne Carter at parcvolunteer@gmail.com Naturally, donations are still welcome.

In the event there should be further court action, we want all information to available immediately. Deep thanks, respect and solidarity to all who made this initiative a success. Please see below for todays statement from the Stein Campaign on the Pennsylvania Court decision. In gratitude, Carl Romanelli/Pennsylvania Recount Coordinator New York Times Article Opinion Piece from LA Times (Philadelphia, PA)  The Stein campaign today said it was disappointed in a federal court ruling Monday morning blocking a statewide hand recount and forensic audit of Pennsylvanias error-prone electronic voting machines, effectively disenfranchising millions of Pennsylvanian voters, especially communities of color. The decision by U.S. District Judge Paul Diamond follows a lawsuit filed by the Stein campaign that read: [The states] incomprehensible, labyrinth, and impossibly burdensome election regime is a disaster for ordinary voters. Were Pennsylvania votes counted accurately? That truth is not difficult to learn: simply count the paper ballots in optical scan districts, and permit forensic examination of the voting systems in [touch-screen] districts. Pennsylvanias election system is stacked against voters. Both the technology by which voters cast ballots, as well as the byzantine and burdensome laws determining recounts in the state, are a national disgrace, said Jill Stein, 2016 Green Party candidate for president. The process underway in Pennsylvania this week is hardly an effective or comprehensive recount. Despite citizens across this state stepping up and demanding their right to verify the vote, every obstacle imaginable  legal, bureaucratic and political  has been thrown in their face. Pennsylvanians constitutional and civil rights to have their voices heard and their votes counted have been stripped from right under them. On Friday, President Obama took the extraordinary step to order a ""full review"" of hacking-related activity aimed at disrupting the 2016 presidential election, amid increasing doubt over the security, accuracy and fairness of the U.S. election system. The announcement is yet the latest indication of the publics lack of trust in the voting election system, and a sign that the irregularities that have already been discovered during recounts in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania  called a political horror show in the New York Times today  underscore the need for reform of the election system. The recounts have begun to expose a modern-day electoral Jim Crow, said Stein. Counting the ballots has raised even more questions about the vulnerability of voting technology, the improper handling of ballots, and quality of election administration. By blocking the recount and suppressing exposure of these problems, Donald Trump and his allies in Pennsylvania are not just perpetuating, but also actively defending the disenfranchisement of people of color. Approximately two-thirds of voting in Pennsylvania is done through Direct Record Electronic (DRE) touch-screen machines, which are susceptible to manipulation and hacking. In fact, many states have banned or are phasing out the use of DRE touch-screen machines over security concerns. Worse, the machines do not dispense any paper ballot or receipt  leaving no evidence of the voting trail  something one election expert called a nightmare scenario."" As a result, the only way to conduct a full, foolproof audit is through a forensic analysis  where cyber-security experts and computer scientists go into the black box of DRE machines and look for malware, bugs or manipulated software or files. But local courts in Pennsylvania have repeatedly denied Stein campaign requests for such an analysis. The remaining one-third of voting in Pennsylvania is done through optical scan ballots, which are also vulnerable to problems and errors. Computer scientists regularly warn about the vulnerabilities of these machines, including that they can be breached without detection and are prone to errors, including a tendency to misread markings made by voters. In Detroit alone, 87 optical scan machines broke on Election Day this year. Substantial research, including a U.S. Civil Rights Commission report, finds that voters of color are at massively increased risk of having their votes misread or simply tossed out by badly maintained and poorly calibrated scanning machines in underserved communities. America's voting machines and optical scanners are prone to errors and susceptible to outside manipulation, said J. Alex Halderman, one of the nations leading cyber security experts and a Professor of Computer Science at the University of Michigan, who attended the federal court hearing in Philadelphia Friday. That's precisely why we need this recount  to examine the physical evidence, to look under the hood. A recount is the best way, and indeed the only way in 2016, to ensure public confidence that the results are accurate, authentic, and untainted by outside interference. In addition to a vulnerable voting process, Pennsylvania has one of the worst recount laws in the nation, requiring a bottom-up process in which voters across the state must bring official, notarized petitions to county boards, in time for shifting, divergent and secret deadlines known. Under Pennsylvania law, more than 27,000 voters in 9,000-plus districts are required to submit a request for a recount before a statewide count can begin. In 2016, concerned voters filed more than 950 recount petitions in nearly 320 election districts in Philadelphia, Allegheny, Berks, Bucks, Centre, Montgomery, and other counties. Donald Trump and GOP allies, however, have used Pennsylvanias decentralized and bureaucratic election system to suppress the recount. After news broke last week that Donald Trumps lead in the state fell from roughly 70,000 to 49,000 votes, within 0.3% of triggering an automatic statewide recount, the Trump campaign filed a legal objection in state court, claiming that following through with the recount would somehow put Pennsylvania at grave risk. Pennsylvania voter Susan Finn, a 43-year-old mother of three who is a registered Independent, was among those in the state who submitted a recount petition as required by law. She petitioned because she's unsure that her vote  which she cast on a touch-screen DRE machine, after Board of Elections officials wrote her name into the rolls manually because her official change to her married name failed to register  was counted. After Mr. Trumps lawyers argued in court against the recount, a Montgomery County judge ruled on Nov. 30 that the recount would not move forward in her precinct. I am outraged that Mr. Trump and allies are trying to deny us our constitutional rights and stop voters voices from being heard, said Mrs. Finn. I petitioned for a recount because my experience voting in Pennsylvania was a mess, filled with bureaucratic roadblocks that made it difficult for me to know, without a doubt, that my vote was counted. I will keep fighting to ensure it did. If Mr. Trump is as patriotic as he says he is, he needs to respect every Americans right to a fair and transparent election."" Lawyers for the Republican Party have crisscrossed the state to fight recounts in courthouses from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. In Montgomery County, for example, Republican lawyers alleged that several voters could not file their recount affidavits because they allegedly failed to pay a required $50 court filing fee, even though they paid almost double that fee. Trumps surrogates have argued that it requires 27,000 voters in all the states 9,000+ precincts to request a recount, in order for the voters in any single precinct to be recounted. In one instance, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court demanded that 100-plus voters who petitioned for a statewide recount pay $1 million total to be able to move forward with their case. Citing the extraordinary financial burden that the state was putting on ordinary residents, the petitioners were forced to withdraw their case. The legal filing in response read simply: Petitioners are regular citizens of ordinary means. They cannot afford to post the $1,000,000 bond required by the Court. Pennsylvania places absurd and unacceptable barriers to democratic participation, said Ilann Maazel, a lawyer for the Stein campaign. Voters dont know if their votes count, and there is no way for them to find out. We cant hide democracy inside a black box. While recounts in some counties have proceeded, experts say that the chosen method  simply re-canvassing voting machines, rather than hand counting paper ballots or examining the software of electronic machines  is insufficient to guarantee the accuracy and security of the voting system. In Philadelphia, for example, the Elections Commission approved a recount in only 75 of nearly 1,700 precincts  but the Commission denied a full forensic audit of the voting machines, opting instead to simply run the ballots back through the machines."
84,vulnerability,The_Donald,Long-form thoughts on the Russian Hacking,6,5i0sa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5i0sa2/longform_thoughts_on_the_russian_hacking/,2016-12-13 12:42:28,"TL;DR - the Russian hack of the DNC is the DNC's fault, not the Russians. Thought: while I agree that if Russia hacked into voting machines in election day, its a major problem, I don't see a shred of evidence to support this, and Trump's vote totals have gone up in recounts, so the idea doesn't even seem plausible. However,..... Every single nation on earth tries to interfere in the internal affairs of every other nation on earth. Uganda? Zimbabwe? The Maldives? Lichtenstein? You'd better believe all of them are either thinking about it or trying it. If a good opportunity comes along to influence the political process of another country to your nation's advantage, every nation on earth will take advantage of it and ask questions later. The US government, and Obama in particular, tried to influence the Brexit vote in America's favor. The British government tried to influence the American election, because, of course they did. The NSA is hacking into Chinese government computers, and Iranian government computers (and this had a real world impact in the case of Iran), at the same time that the Chinese and the Iranians are trying to hack into American government computers. The US, and our allies, might have lost WW2 if we didn't solve the Nazi's enigma code (i.e. be able to read their coded communications). Russia is trying to influence the domestic politics of the US, and the US is obviously trying to influence the domestic politics of Russia. When Russia lost a lot of leverage during the Saudis trying to crater the price of oil, of course the US took advantage of that leverage. The price of oil plummeted in early 2015, bottoming out at $29 a barrel in January 2016. The Iranians knew that with the collapse of oil prices, they couldn't depend on Russian aid indefinitely anymore. No matter what you thought about the Iran Nuclear deal, it was not a coincidence that falling oil prices, and a weakened Russia, helped bring Iran to the negotiating table and that an agreement was worked out middle of last year. That's just how the game is played, and there's nothing untoward about it. The leverage changed, the Iranians made the calculation that a deal was better at the moment than the status quo, and the US made the same calculation and a deal was struck. If Russia was able to hack the DNC and release embarrassing emails about the Clinton campaign through wikileaks, that's not the fault of Russia or Wikileaks, that's the fault of the DNC for not understanding a security issue and taking steps to correct it. The possibility of downloading virus onto a computer and allowing a hack is always possible, that's why organizations have anti-virus and network and IT security policies. If you know how to protect yourself, and you don't protect yourself, I don't want you running my government, because how do I know you'll protect me when its the DoD's servers or the State Department's? To me, you knew the threat, and it happened anyway, that's a clue that your a fool, because only a fool ignores a known vulnerability (and there is no way the DNC didn't have IT consultants who told them there was a problem, they knew, which is better than a lot of people get). WW2 was lost for the Germans because the Allies cracked the enigma code. I'm an IT professional, who did his senior thesis on the engima machine and how it was beat. With the enigma code cracked, the allies were able to persuade hitler, with fake intelligence that they planted, that the D-day invasion was coming at the Pas de Calias. Hitler moved his panzer divisions from Normandy to the Pau De Calias. If those Panzers had been there when D-day happened, the allies would have been blown back into the sea. Why was Enigma cracked? Mathematically, without the aid of computers, it is uncrackable so long as standard operating procedures are always followed by every German officer who used the machine. German soldiers didn't follow IT security best practices, one german soldier who set the key to the enigma as his Girlfriend's name every single time (rather than changing it frequently, like he was supposed to) did incredible damage to the enigma and allowed Allied mathematicians to break it. Those German soldiers don't get the right to complain, if they were doing their jobs, like they were supposed to do and were taught to do, the war would have been different. If the DNC had followed IT best practices that their IT consultants no doubt recommended they follow, they would never have been hacked. It is not the job of others to secure your network by not breaking in, there will always be people who try to break it, it is your job to secure your network. When the US recently assassinated ISIS's #2, he had been very careful (read this article from the post: URL He never complained that US surveillance made it impossible for him to function, he knew he was a dead man if he slipped up. Eventually, he had to take a risk and he had to go out and speak to his people, the US saw it and nailed him. He accepted that the US was going to do everything we could to eliminate him, he lived with it, and took every security precaution, that's how he made it as long as he did. Why didn't the DNC take every security precaution? He didn't cry about it, he knew it was his life, and eventually, the US military eradicated him when he had to come up for daylight. Our enemies don't get to complain when we take them out by hook or by crook, so why do the democrats complain when they play the game on the same field according to the same rules? The Russians hacking the DNC and leaking Clinton's emails make me optimistic about the world, just like the Obama administration attempting to influence Brexit and interfering in elections all over the world make me optimistic about the world. If Putin didn't order the DNC hack, and didn't try to influence the American elections, I'd consider that the far more frightening scenario. The cost of doing so was low, and the potential reward was high, any person with a modicum of intelligence absolutely should have done the same thing. It tells me Putin is not an idiot, that he's one of the adults in the room who can do a simple cost-benefit calculation. Russia has the world's second largest and most potent nuclear arsenal. I want a competent person, who can do cost-benefit analysis, in charge of that nation, and that nuclear arsenal. Russian instability is bad for everyone on planet earth. You know the thing about being an adult? Being an adult means you accept the world as it is, and being an adult means that, even though Russia probably was behind the DNC hack, that if an opportunity comes up in the future where Russia and America can do business to our mutual good, that an adult can put the hacks and counter-hacks behind them as ""professional due diligence"", not hold a grudge and do business with each other. Adults understand how the game is played, children lack that capacity, and that's why you want adults in charge. As Ferengi rule of acquisition #177 states: ""know your enemies....but do business with them always."" I understand why Hillary is going this route right now. She's not trying to overturn the election, or call out the Russians (she has done business with them, and will continue to do so), she's simply trying to make a new Trump administration as un-legitimate in the eyes of as many people as she can, and the MSM is aiding and abetting her cause by writing and talking about it endlessly. This is an attempt to curtail what a President Trump can do, making him appear illegitimate drives up the political cost of whatever he tries to do once in office. I expect Trump knows this, because the birther movement was Trump attempting to do the same thing with Obama. Now that the democrats are the minority party, I expect they'll spend all their time doing exactly what the GOP did in 2008-2010 when they were the minority party: obstruct everything. All the BS the dems sprouted about GOP obstruction will become utter hypocrisy. That's why we need to drain the swamp. They all have and make the same balance of power calculations, and they will all sell out their fellow Americans should it prove advantageous to do so. The only people who will look out for us, and our way of life, is us. I think Trump is off to a splendid start, so far, but I will always watch and be wary. Trust is earned, not given, and that applies to everyone, equally. This sub-reddit has been a sea of rationality and belonging. Pray we can keep it that way. I can't even read the post-election liberal media anymore, they are so spitefull and full of cognitive dissonance (as based Adams would say). That's what I hate most about liberals post-election: they lost, and they have zero accountability or self-reflection. They didn't just lose the white house, they were heavily favored to retake the Senate and fell way short of expectations. They got beaten, badly, and they have assigned zero blame to the culprits: themselves."

Good news is she is concerned about ""flagrant racial inequities"" whatever that means",21,5if48k,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5if48k/4_time_loser_and_scam_artist_jillary_stein/,2016-12-15 14:03:49,"This is what democracy looks like! As the recount comes to a close, I want to thank you - over 10,000 volunteers and more than 161,000 donors - who made this extraordinary, historic campaign possible. We affirmed the power of the American people to demand a voting system we can trust, that is accurate, secure and just, and free from modern-day Jim Crow in our elections. We pushed forward in three states, defiant in the face of political blockades, bureaucratic hurdles and financial intimidation. By revealing serious problems in our voting systems  out-of-date laws and recount procedures, politicized courts, machine failure and vulnerability, and flagrant racial inequities - these recounts were a resounding success. Our efforts have shined a light on the urgent need for reforms to our electoral system, and to the recounts that are supposed to safeguard that system.We look forward to continuing our work together to make those reforms a reality. Ending our historic fundraising drive to pay for the recount, we look to you for input on how to use any funds that may remain. We are working hard to determine final costs, pending word from the states as to the ultimate costs of the recount in each state. Once those costs are finalized, all remaining money will go to a set of non-partisan election reform and voting rights organizations based on your input in an online, ranked choice vote. The final list of organizations who could receive the leftover funds will be made public on our website in the coming weeks, and you as the engine of this process will be the first to know. After a bitter, divisive election, now facing serious threats to our civil and constitutional rights, defending the bedrock of democracy - our right to vote, and to be confident in that vote - is more important than ever. Moving forward, I, along with the Green Party, am committed to continue to fight with you for election integrity and voting justice on the frontlines of this struggle. Thank you again for all you have done to build the movement for elections we can trust. In these unprecedented challenging times, we have taken a defiant leap forward towards the democracy we deserve, and the just and sustainable future that depends on it. I look forward to our continuing work together."

The more this can be non-partisan, the better served the American people are going to be, which is why I made the point earlier and I'm going to keep on repeating this point, our vulnerability to Russia or any other foreign power is directly related to how divided, partisan, dysfunctional our political process is. That's the thing that makes us vulnerable. If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect. It doesn't seem that far-fetched compared to some of the other stuff that folks are hearing from domestic propagandists."

Bill Clinton. On December 31, 1969 Oxford student and anti-war activist Bill Clinton came to Moscow through Holland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland for 5-days vacation at expensive ""National"" Hotel. His autobiography says the only person he knew in Moscow was Anik ""Nikki"" Alexis, a daughter of a French diplomat who was now studying at the Patrice Lumumba Peoples' Friendship University. Clinton recalls, ""One night I took a bus out to Lumumba University to have dinner with Nikki and some of her friends"" On the bus back home, Clinton says, there was only one other passenger, Oleg Rakito, who ""spoke better English than I did"" and ""asked me lots of questions and told me he worked for the government, virtually admitting he was assigned to keep an eye on me"". The story is all fake. First, foreigners who can afford ""National"" don't use public transportation on January -30 C night. Second, KGB officer might reveal his identity to a foreigner only if he's recruiting him. Third, Bill Clinton was recruited, otherwise he would have left Moscow immediately and in panic. Instead, he enjoyed the rest of his vacation and went to Chechoslovakia, another socialist country. Bill Clinton tried to move America towards socialism through health care reform plan. His effort ultimately died, though Obama finished the job successfully. Clinton helped Russians to save their secret source, CIA ""mole"" John Deutch. Deutch was born in Belgium to a Russian father and he was the only Russian CIA Director. He got some jobs with top secrets access : 1983 - Presidents Commission on Strategic Forces, 1990-1993 - the Presidents Intelligence Advisory Board member , 1993-1994 - Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, Deputy Defense Secretary, 1995-1996 Director of Central Intelligence Agency. Since 2000 - MIT Professor and Director for Citigroup. Deutch was appointed CIA Director by President Clinton and stayed in Langley in 1995- 1996. He is a Russian ""mole,"" and hes safe because President Clinton obstructed the investigation and pardoned this enemy of state in 2001. John Deutch ordered my recruitment. In 1995 I, a former KGB intelligence officer and Ukrainian National Security illegal spy, came to USA where I hoped to work for the government as strategic intelligence analyst. I was recruited by CIA as ""Filament"" and had to work also for FBI National Security Division - it was CIA-FBI conspiracy.I had to spy on the U.S. Congress They wanted also to influence the White House and I wrote ""The Professional"" system special instructions for President Bill Clinton (now in use by Barack Obama). My ""White House Special Handbook"", 2007 is based on ""The Professional"". I state that political control over the White House and the U.S. Congress, not national security, was and is the CIA and FBI top priority. The also had ""a very important job up to my high professional skills as a sniper"". I didn't want to kill politicians. They've pressed me very hard in return. .Three months before 9/11 tragedy happened, in June 2001, I've warned American President George W. Bush and the U.S. Senate on CIA anti-American activity, national security collapse and my personal situation. My Senator Hillary Clinton refused to mess with CIA . In September 2002, White House sent a request to the Dept. of Justice, where FBI Director R. Mueller blocked it because I was a ""joint"" CIA-FBI project. Senator Chuck Schumer's (D) Office explained to me that ""American national security is not his business"".President Obama, Janet Napolitano, Homeland Security Secretary and Mark Kappelhof, Dept. of Justice Civil Rights Division keep silence. In 2007, ALGORA, a small publishing company, released my ""White House Special Handbook, or How to Rule the World in the 21st Century"", based on ""The Professional"". 300 universities and colleges including Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Georgetown and Oxford, learn top political management in a right, KGB way . Three signs are enough to triangulate a ""mole"" and here they are for Mr. Deutch: 1. Two days after Deutch retired from the CIA, on December 16, 1996, technical personnel discovered at his house highly classified information stored on his unclassified computer, loaded from his agency computer. He refused to explain why he violated strict security rules. First, Director of Central Intelligence doesnt need highly classified data on his home computer, because he is a bureaucrat, not an analyst. Second, here we have a trick  the Internet-connected computer is accessible by anyone with some technical knowledge and you dont have to send anything  the Russians will read secret information right from your home computer. 2. In 1997 the CIA began a formal security investigation. It was determined that his computer was often connected to the Internet with no security, and that Deutch was known to leave memory cards with classified data lying in his car. Deutch used his influence to stop further any investigation and the CIA took no action until 1999, when it suspended his security clearances. He admitted finally the security breach and merely apologized. 3. In 1999 the Defense Department started its own investigation, and it appeared that in 1993 Deutch, as Defense Undersecretary, used unsecured computers at home and his America Online (!) account to access classified defense information. As Deputy Defense Secretary, he declined departmental requests in 1994 to allow security systems to be installed in his residence. 4. In 2000 Senator Charles Grassley asked the Justice Department to look into the case. There was no investigation. In 2001 President Clinton pardoned Deutch. There were no comments. Part 2. ""Barack Obama"" =========================================== On November 4, 2008 ""Barack Obama"" won presidential election. He was born on August 4, 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii.If there's something very wrong with someone's birth certificate and if there's an indication that this someone used a birth certificate information of a newborn child (Virginia Sunahara) who died at birth or soon after birth, we have to talk about the methods Russian intelligence (SVR, a former KGB) and its illegal espionage department. We have to talk about one of the stages of the illegal spy ""documentation process"" - using ""special"" birth certificates to get legal documents in USA - SS#, driver license, passport. Hawaii law requires the registration of a death within 3 days and the registration of a birth within 7 days. With an Aug. 4, 1961, birthdate, Virginia Sunahara's birth registration was filed as late as Aug. 11, 1961  the same day the Nordyke twins' birth certificates were filed by Kapi'olani hospital with the Hawaii Department of Health local registrar and registrar general. Susan Nordyke, the twin born first, received birth certificate number 10637; Gretchen Nordyke, the second, received number 10638. Barack Obama's birth certificate was issued the number 10641, even though it was registered three days before the Nordykes' certificates. However, if the birth certificate number 10641 was first assigned to Virginia Sunahara, the apparent conflict could be explained. Now, let's reconstruct Obama's biography as I see it with my 30 years of espionage experience. Illegal spy cover story works best if it's a mix of actual and fake facts. ""Obama"" (let's call him John Smith) was a child of a student from Kenya whop studied at the Peoples' Friendship University in Moscow and who dated a Russian girl. Such kids in Russia were often unwanted by both partners and were raised and educated at a special school. Like Obama, John Smith was born in 1961 and like him graduated from high school in 1979. KGB paid attention to a very smart young man. Lieutenant Smith was Intelligence Institute student in 1979-1982 (it's in Moscow, not far from ""Cosmos"" Hotel - there are couple of buildings in the area and I got intelligence education myself in one of them back in 1987). Then a decision was made to train him individually as illegal intelligence officer .The ""dacha"" (Russian for small villa) not far from Moscow, provides an ideally isolated territory for training. Two or three instructors also live there to immerse the candidate completely and supervise him all the time. The internal fittings of the dacha are prepared very thoroughly and carefully. From the first day the candidate becomes accustomed to the circumstances in which he will be living and working in USA for many years. He wears American clothes, eats the food, he's thinking, acting and living like 100% American . From the first day of his training he is supplied with the majority of papers and magazines, he's watching movies and TV shows. The instructors ask the candidate the most difficult questions imaginable with regard to what has been read and seen. After a number of years of such training, the future illegal knows everything about America, espionage technology and speaks perfect English. At the same time, in 1979-1981, Barack Obama studied at Occidental College in Los Angeles where he became a socialist ready to transform the nation by redistributing wealth. KGB station in Washington, DC which was constatntly looking for future secret sources at American universities and colleges, got information about young socialist. They sent his picture and some info to Moscow where strking resemblance was discovered between a college student from Los Angeles and a future illegal spy John Smith. In mid-1981, Obama travelled to Indonesia to visit his mother and sister Maya, and visited the families of college friends in India and Pakistan for 3 weeks. Then something happened in India, a good friend to Soviet Union and a perfect place to recruit foreigners. He was not recruited, he disappeared and John Smith aka Barack Obama came back to the United States - change of agents, one of regular illegal espionage methods.. In 1982 Obama's father died in a car accident in Nairobi, his mother lived in Indonesia and might be just avoided or ignored by her ""son"" (Don Johnson, Dunham co-worker said ""Obama was distancing himself from her"". Russians approached Ann Dunham under a ""false flag"" ( National Security Agency or CIA) and explained that her son had to stay abroad for a secret mission for some time. They told her that she had to be ready to accept another person as her own son. For operation like that, espionage agencies often recruit close relatives and allow them to meet their son(daughter) from time to time outside USA. Money talks, there's nothing unusual, though for Dunham the pressure and depression was too big - she died in 1995 of cancer at 52. Time changes people, so ""Obama"" had to stay away from his friends and do not show up in public too much. In 1981 he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science and where nobody could remember him, and graduated with a B.A. in 1983. In 1983-1985 he worked at the Business International Corporation and at the New York Public Interest Research Group. ""Obama"" had to function like a regular illegal spy, living a quite life , staying away from his mother and old friends, recruiting secret sources and sending information to Moscow. He worked in Chicago as community organizer in 1985-1988 and in mid-1988 travelled to Europe to meet his KGB handlers and get new instructions. He had a choice - a safe variant (to make a political career in one of African countries), and a risky one of staying in America - KGB wanted him to be Martin Luther King #2 or one of African leaders. But it appeared he get much more which is Oval Office. It was decided he could stay in USA longer and it was a success : Illinois state senator (1997-2004) and U.S. Senator (2005-2008). . In 2005 he visited Russia together with Senator R.Lugar and met his SVR handlers to discuss his prospectives for the U.S. presidency. In 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States. In 2008 he won the race and became the first Russian illegal spy to be elected the U.S. President.The Congressional Research Service, a public policy arm of Congress, officially admits no one in the government ever vetted Obama's constitutional eligibility. After his victory in November 2008. American President ""Barack Obama"", the most powerful man in the world, lost sense of reality and ignored his Russian intelligence boss (Mikhail Fradkov) instructions - he had his own vision on how to rule and destroy America .Russians were not going to lose control over the White House and American President. They explained to Obama, that it's OK, but he had to work together with Bill Clinton, a ""big friend of Russia"" and his people.. Bill Clinton was instructed what to do and in November 2008 Obama had to divide the power - he appointed Hillary Clinton the Secretary of State, Rahm Emanuel ( Clinton's chief political adviser) - the White House Chief of Staff and Leon Panetta (Clinton's Chief of Staff) - CIA Director. On October 2, 2010 he managed to fire Rahm Emanuel (I'll tell you why) and after that Russians humiliated him one more time - in April 28, 2011, he was forced to nominate Panetta to replace Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. If confirmed (in July , 2011), Panetta would end all operations and withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq - that's another Russian intelligence order. Obama, actually, lost half of his power by giving two key Cabinet positions to Clintons team - that's how Russians punished their illegal spy for his independence. Still, as a Russian illegal intelligence officer he's good. He's destroying America - its called ""socialist intervention into the US economy"". Besides, while Bill Clinton saved one Russian ""mole"" John Deutch, Obama saved 10 (ten) Russian illegal spies sending them back to Russia in 2010 without any investigation - severe blow to American national security and priceless gift to SVR, Russian intelligence. In April, 2011 he announced his intention to seek re-election in 2012. Coming collapse of America is the KGB/SVR payback for what happened to the Soviet Union which disappeared from the globe. Part 3. Hillary Clinton ======================================= 2012 is coming and there's a player who'll never give up and whom Russian intelligence service can't stop. Hillary Clinton with a team of her own. In March , 2010 Ive received an invitation for a dinner with President Barack Obama and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi from DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) signed by Ian Sugar, Director of Development. Sugar explained that I pay $15,999 (credit card) and on May 13, 2010, at 6.00 PM I can come to St. Regis hotel, New York . Now, guess who was the DCCC Chairman in 2005-2009 and who could advise Ian Sugar to send Kryzhanovsky, a former KGB sniper, an invitation to a dinner with Obama ? Rahm Emanuel. I didn't go, instead I've put on YouTube my video to show vulnerability of Obama's protection system. On October, 12 2010, I had a meeting with two Secret Service agents, John and Bratt (646-842-2107) - they were very nervous about the video We had a long discussion. I've asked them why they allow the White House press office to put Obama's next day schedule on Internet with exact time and place of his trips - it gives a perfect possibility to kill him. They told me it was Rahm Emanuel's order and they can do nothing though on October 2, 2010 Obama fired Emanuel and it was a small victory over Clintons. More interesting - they told me they wanted me to work for them too :"" We know you as ""Filament"", you work for CIA and we want you to work for us too under the same alias. We'll pay you"". So, I'm still acting CIA agent and they're still sure I'll do political murders ? And who's the target - Obama ? That's why Secret service is nervous - they are in the game ? That's not the end. On January, 20 2011 I talked to FBI agent Eric Perry. He said my video made ""high authorities, people on the very top vextremely nervous"". He didn't explain if it was FBI Director Robert Mueller, the White House Chief of Staff or Obama himself. He asked me to delete the video from YouTube. Why FBI is so nervous, they are in the game ? Like with JFK assassination, you don't need huge conspiracy - it's enough if CIA Director, FBI Director and Secret Service Director make a deal. Back in 1963 they made a deal not to touch Lee Oswald untill he finished the job - simple, right , Mrs Hillary Clinton ? Part 4. What's next ? ======================================== ""Birth certificate"" story made Obama very angry, but actually he's in panic. Russians are in panic too - it was a 100% surprise for them. They didn't initially that Obama might get the Oval Office and his enemies would put his fake biography and documents under microscope. Russians could ask Donald Trump to stop his own investigation (Trump met Russian leader Putin and stated that America needs a president like him), but he will run for president in 2012 and he has to press Obama (Trump says ""no"", but polls say ""yes""). Now ""Obama"" has to make a choice together with his Russian boss Mikhail Fradkov, SVR Director: 1) resign or just disappear and go back to Russia 2) commit suicide or wait until Hillary Clinton's clan kills him with my help, though I can tell Robert Mueller, Leon Panetta and Mark Sullivan one more time - I'm not coming back, I will not kill ""Barack Obama"" or anybody else, stop calling me and sending agents to get me back 3) continue his re-election campaign and presidential activity no matter what 4) fight Hillary Clinton's mafia, cut off any attempts to investigate his biography There's also ""one-way ticket"" possibility, if Russian intelligence makes a decision to ""neutralize"" ""Obama"" (staged car accident, etc) to avoid huge international scandal. ========================================== Mikhail Kryzhanovsky . 30 years of international espionage experience KGB Counterintelligence School KGB Intelligence Institute a former KGB intelligence officer a former KGB ""Nabat"" anti-terror group sniper a former SBU (Ukrainian Security Service) illegal intelligence officer a former CIA/FBI ""Filament"" the author of the White House Special Handbook, Algora,2007 the author of the US National Security System, 2011 unemployed, homeless prof7prof@yahoo.com ""Barack Obama 2012 : KGB technology 2008"" YouTube Video URL ""Mikhail Kryzhanovsky"" YouTube Video URL "

You may recall me from the AMA I did, in which I detailed how my work in vulnerability research is directly applicable to voter fraud given the exploitability of such systems. To some extent, I felt compelled to blow the whistle and point out how broken everything was, and remains to be. Now, we are beyond that, I'm still here, and now I'd like to push forward with a new project. Twitter has been flooded by peace loving, anti-gun liberals, calling for the assassination of Trump in what might be their most egregious display of cognitive dissonance to date. I've seen intermittent mentions of reporting these people to the Secret Service, but thus far, it seems there's been little in the way of organizational effort. So, I have a simple proposition: I'd like to construct a simple system with which we can track these would-be assassins, capture as much information about them as possible, and provide detailed, consistent reports that can be provided to appropriate law enforcement agencies, so they can take action to the fullest extent. They have gone too far with their threats, and now is the time to push back in a way that will make them shit their pants, because this list of threats will be made public, for all to see. If this is something my fellow centipedes would like to take part in, please let me know. I can have such a system up and running in days, and we can retaliate with such organization that it puts the fear of god in their utterly godless hearts. If you're interested, I'd to begin by forming a posse of trusted centipedes that would be granted write access to the aforementioned list. That said, I'm all for hearing feedback. I think this is a wonderful idea, and an excellent opportunity to begin draining the swamp before Trump even officially takes officers. So please share your comments, criticisms, and whatever other feedback you may have. # MAGA"

Where the art stops and the madness begins is asked less often than it ought to be here. But if such a divide really exists -- and some people argue persuasively that it doesn't -- it probably starts with the bleeding. Luckily for the squeamish, only a few works in ""Me, Myself and I: Artist Self-Portraits from the Heather and Tony Podesta Collection"" -- which runs at the Contemporary Art Center of Virginia through May 7 -- count actual wincing among their intended responses. Much more common is the confounding sense of mystery found in such images as English artist's Gillian Wearing's ""Self-Portrait."" This giant color headshot puts the artist behind a sphinxlike mask -- with all her facial features except her eyes and nostrils concealed by an eerily blank expanse of flesh-colored plastic. So bland and generic are the painted eyebrows and barely contoured lips that they offer virtually no clue about anything -- much less the human being concealed beneath the surface. It's this dearth of information, however, that compels you to scour the rest of the portrait for something tangible. And though Wearing's pale neck and long black hair become inordinately important as a result, it's the eyes peering through the stamped-out holes that pulse with the most suggestive power. Still, no matter how long you puzzle over these piercing brown orbs, they provide few solid leads for your speculations. Indeed, all the wondering that Wearing so successfully provokes tells us more about ourselves than the riddle behind the mask. Similar quandaries envelop two of the photographs in Ann Hamilton's ""body-object"" series. In untitled self-portrait ""#8,"" the American artist conjures up an unsettling experience **through the deceptively simple ploy of covering her face with a beat-up Ping-Pong paddle.** Blind, mute and seemingly featureless, this well-used survivor still lends considerable character to the portrait because of its nicked-up surface. Hamilton's muscular arms and short, bristly hair provide crucial evidence, too. **But exactly what this strange pairing reveals or conceals about either of its subjects is left unanswered.** Korean-born artist Nikki Lee pushes this theme in another direction, assuming the identities of an urban hip-hop chick -- then a partly naked exotic dancer -- as extensions of a fluid, chameleonlike persona. But her tight cornrows and pierced tongue don't reshape her physical form as much as the so-called ""body artists"" in the show. In ""Penitenza,"" Italian artist Letizia Cariello transforms herself into a record of anguished love, covering parts of her face, abdomen and feet with column after column of letters and numbers spawned by a secret code of intimate disappointments. Even without a key to these ciphers, each of the nine photos documenting these inscriptions seems to throb with pain and vulnerability, especially the image that traces the symbols tumbling from her mouth, spilling down her neck and chest, then washing up on her shoulder. More arresting still is the **five-pointed star that Marina Abramovic cuts across her stomach with a double-edged razor blade.** Steel yourself to the sight of blood and you may detect a fluid elegance to the slashing lines with which this renowned Yugoslavian artist corrals her own navel. If you flinch at her self-inflicted wound, you're not alone. Abramovic has been known to hurt herself until her audience makes her stop. She has more in mind than embodying the repressive communist regime under which she grew up. Whatever the personal reasons behind this crimson star, much of Abramovic's motive is to make you share her pain. And it's what you feel as you watch her bleed that ultimately completes this searingly unforgettable self-portrait."""

Dems have unwittingly ensured this debate gets more viewers and has more significance than the last one and are perhaps just realizing that now. All those official advisors who urged restraint during the first debate must be assumed to be bad-faith actors IF they're recommending the same strategy for the second debate. Trump is not Pence, and Hillary is not Kaine. Speaking as a former Bernie supporter, I can tell you the issues-focused strategy is an idealistic LOSER when dealing with a Clinton. Remember what David Axelrod, Obama's strategist, wrote about Hillary in an Obama campaign memo: Her number one vulnerability is her character. Winning points: * Bill rape, Hillary enabling. * Saudi Arabia, Hillary, and women. * Political dynasties. Note how the Bushes are supporting the Clintons this election. These two families have been raping the American public. Trump has failed to drive home the alarming point that if Hillary is elected, that's two Bushes and two Clintons in recent memory. This will rattle Americans on a visceral level. Rigged system. * Vulnerability as a potential opening message: ""I'm not always a nice guy. I don't pretend to be an angel. I'm not going to win any awards for political correctness from overly scripted politicians. What I can tell you is this: I will fight for this country in ways you won't believe. I will not be nice, polished, and scripted about it. What has nice, polished, and scripted ever done for you and your family? They call me an egomaniac. You know what? I'm too much of an egomaniac to let you and your family fall on my watch."" * ""If you're honest, you can see I've been fought every way of my journey by the mainstream media and both political establishments. Trust in the mainstream media is at an all-time low. Why are these political elites so afraid of me? What does your gut tell you? They know I'm rich and don't need their money. I'm going to do the right thing."" * TPP. Watch how Hillary stumbled during the first debate when asked about Obama and TPP. Trump should've kept pressing it: ""Do you agree with Obama's TPP push or not? That's not an answer, Hillary. Do you agree with it or not?"" * Obamacare, Bill's remarks. ""Do you agree with Bill that Obamacare is crazy or not? That's not an answer, Hillary. Do you agree with it or not?"" * Private and public personas, transcripts. * Two justice systems, one for Hillary and one for everyone else. See soldier in prison for taking pics in a nuclear sub. * Reiterate how the Dems use minorities for votes every four years and deliver nothing in return. * Every zinger from Hillary must be reduced to a focus-group brainstorm. Undecided voters can sense she's scripted, and in persuasion, those who tell you something you feel to be true earn a lot of trust capital. Above all else, Trump must NOT be put on the defensive. He can show some endearing vulnerability in opening and closing statements, but the rest of the debate needs to be offense, offense, offense. The mantra at the back of his mind needs to be ""If you're explaining, you're losing."""

This is why they need masses of paid shills here on Reddit, to create the illusion of enthusiastic support. &gt; If there are secret Clinton talking points to surrogates to attack Bernie---and I now believe the story is true-----she is going to create ill-will that neither she nor her staff can even imagine. .. &gt;What will happen if this continues is Bernie will get pissed off and lash back and I can write the words he will say if Clinton tactics anger him----FBI investigation and aides taking the Fifth will be among them---and it will not be pretty. Podesta responds : &gt;We already discussed Castro. Beyond that, why do you think that story is not just a bunch of hyped up BS intended to have exactly the kind of reaction you are exhibiting?

Neera writes: &gt;Why did she call herself a moderate? Podesta replies: &gt;I pushed her on this on Sunday night. She claims she didn't remember saying it. **Not sure I believe her.** We were speculating, that it may be a Don Baer intervention. John Podesta, the chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, thinks that Hillary may be lying to him here. To even think this Podesta MUST believe that Hillary is a pathological liar who just can't stop lying. Podesta simply does not believe or trust her. You know your ""trustworthy"" numbers must be bad when you read ""Not sure I believe her"" from your own goddamn campaign chairman. Neera Tanden angrily responds &gt;I mean it makes my life more difficult after telling every reporter I know she's actually progressive but that is really the smallest of issues. **It worries me more that she doesn't seem to know what planet we are all living in at the moment.** URL _____________________________ EMAILID 19070 Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook writes to John Podesta May 2015: &gt;And I still want HRC to win badly.

Which is interesting because while staff creates this statement they admit she pushed and advocated for TPP.

100,vulnerability,The_Donald,I am 100% convinced that civil war is coming regardless of who wins in November. Just read this before you accuse me of wearing a tin foil hat. (long),44,50qsdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/50qsdv/i_am_100_convinced_that_civil_war_is_coming/,2016-09-02 11:34:59,"This is an article from naturalnews.com The clock is ticking for America. There are 70 days remaining until the presidential election, and after the results are counted, America will be a tinderbox ready to explode no matter who wins. What follows is an educated analysis of the political friction now escalating in America. Note carefully that nothing in this article should be construed as any intention to call for violence of any kind. I do reference such acts, however, as part of human history as well as likely outcomes in our near future. What I'm offering here is an analysis and a warning, along with a call to prepare for what's coming. If Trump wins, the left goes full terror As I've publicly predicted numerous times over the last year, if Donald Trump wins, the radical extreme leftists go on a violent rampage that leads to the rest of us begging for martial law. After half a dozen cities burn with riots and looting, Trump invokes a national emergency, deploying National Guard troops across the most devastated urban areas, and the radical left finds itself in a shooting war with the government. If Hillary Clinton wins, all the Trump supporters who have been violently assaulted, spat upon and physically attacked by the radical left un-holster their concealed weapons and start shooting back. This quickly escalates into open warfare between lunatic leftist Hillary supporters and armed Trump ""Second Amendment"" people who basically figure they've got nothing left to lose anyway, so why not fight to save America? This was all pointed out in an insightful reader comment posted to The Burning Platform on August 29th: With the rise of Donald Trump, the plan of the political elites has been to provoke violence and blame it on him, thus scaring the normal populace. Early-on there were the road-blockings, the threatened riots, the cancelled events in Chicago and Cincinnati, the beatings, the police ordered to ""look the other way""and it has continued: The screaming harassment and physical attacks on Trump supporters as they leave his rallies. The spitting. The intimidation. The thrown eggs. The shoves and punches. The cars blocked and damaged. The hats snatched off people's heads, stomped on, and then burned on the ground... The people who support Trump are increasingly well-armed, and increasingly seething with justifiable rage. For now they hold back. Donald Trump himself has repeatedly observed that ""the safest place in America"" for anti-Trump protesters is at Trump rallies. And that is true. For now (except for the one old cowboy who punched out the protester, he was an octogenarian outlier). Why is this? Why the docility in the face of clear provocation? It is because Trump supporters understand that any retaliatory violence now will be instantly, widely, and incessantly portrayed by the whorish mainstream media as proof that ""Trump is dangerous"" and ""Trump's movement is violent"" and ""Trump invites violence."" So his supporters endure the abuse. They endure the spittle. They endure the shoves and punches. They endure the theft of their possessions. They endure the damaged cars and the incessant harassment. For now, for the sake of their political movement and the candidacy of Donald Trump, they do not strike back... But what happens after the election? It matters not who wins. If Hillary Clinton is elected, by hook or by crook, the mass movement harnessed by Donald Trump will be free to respond to physical attacks. If Donald Trump wins the Presidency, there will similarly be no reason to continue to endure physical attacks and humiliations by the street thugs of the Democrats. Whether Trump or Hillary Clinton is in the White House, there will be no reason to hold back. Hundreds of millions of guns across America are now in the hands of people who are fed up with being stomped on, ridiculed and marginalized by a corrupt leftist regime that's destroying America Do the math on this one: You've got 44% of U.S. households that now own guns (and not just one gun each, but several different types of guns). Over the last 8 years, President Obama's anti-gun rhetoric has resulted in the largest surge of gun sales to private citizens ever recorded in American history. As a result of Obama's criminal efforts to try to destroy the Second Amendment via false flag operations such as Operation Fast and Furious, more Americans than ever now own battle rifles such as ARs, AKs and PTR 91s. People bought all these guns for a reason. And they sure didn't buy them just to turn them over to a corrupt criminal government. The reader comment continues: Whatever happens after this Presidential election, it will have been unleashed by the corporate elites and their servants in the media and elsewhere. They will be responsible for blood in the streets... And many will cheer it. What the author is saying is, essentially, America is quite likely just 70 days away from the start of the next revolution... or even events that could escalate into Civil War. A Hillary victory would set off an immediate popular revolt If Hillary wins the election, it's hard not to imagine some sort of popular revolt across America as the citizens reject the obvious criminality and corruption of not just the Clinton crime family but also a complicit mainstream media. The same media that has funneled millions of dollars into the Clinton Foundation also intentionally downplays all the Clinton scandals. The entire system is a corrupt, incestuous, rigged f--kfest that benefits the deceitful plutocrats whom the voters are sick and tired of seeing remain in power. As world history teaches us, it would only take a tiny fraction of the American people marching on Washington to overthrow the corrupt regime and install a new interim government while arresting the mainstream journalists and calling for new, open elections. So much of America is already at the breaking point now that such a move would very likely enjoy widespread support from the population at large. Such actions are far more common than you might suspect in other countries around the world. When the masses reach their limit on corruption and criminality at the highest levels of government, history has shown they frequently march on the capitol, arrest the traitors, and install new officials to run the government. Sometimes, these people end up being dictators or tyrants who make things worse, so such actions should never be taken lightly. Revolt should only be the very last, reluctant option after every legal, democratic method of restoring the law has been attempted and denied. If any of this sounds surprising to you, you probably need to study world history and read about the French Revolution, the Bolivar campaign across South America, the Fidel Castro takeover of Cuba, the CIA-instigated revolutions of Central and South American nations, the Cultural Revolution of China, and of course the American Revolution. If you don't know anything about history, then you have no clue how history reliably repeats itself as human populations re-experience the same tyrannies, the same political deceptions and the same inner call for freedom that our ancestors already lived through (or died for). There's nothing new under the sun... everything we are about to experience has happened before. (And the Clintons are nothing new, either. They're the same old corrupt crony tyrants and sleaze peddlers we've always seen seeking power to rule over others.) If Trump wins, the globalist banksters crash the debt bubble to unleash mass chaos Now let's shift gears and explore what happens if Trump wins the election. The day after the election results show Trump to be the clear winner, radical leftists break out into mass protests across America. But Obama is still in power at this point, and Trump won't actually occupy the White House until early 2017. So for the remainder of 2016, Obama will open the borders wide open and even encourage as many illegals as possible to invade the USA in a final ""mad dash"" to the USA. Very soon after Trump takes office, the globalist criminal bankers will deliberately crash the global debt bubble so they can blame it all on Trump. Supported by the lying, wholly dishonest propaganda media (CNN, WashPost, NY Times, etc.), global info-terrorists like George Soros will call for Trump's impeachment. Trump, in turn, will likely call upon ""Second Amendment people"" to defend America against the globalist attempts to bring it down and destroy his presidency. This situation quickly escalates into a variety of skirmishes across America, which might include many events that could seem unimaginable today: Armed patriots taking over mainstream media broadcast centers, leftist terrorists bombing federal buildings, a rash of sudden ""suicides"" of high-level Trump loyalists, organized gang assaults on local police stations, the United Nations unleashing ""blue helmet"" troops on U.S. soil, a ""surge invasion"" of illegal aliens from Mexico during a time of national vulnerability, international cyber attacks on America's power grid infrastructure, and even widespread calls for states like Texas to secede from the union. Once the globalists declare open warfare against the Trump administration, all bets are off and anything could unfold over the next few years. Expect things to get very nasty, very desperate and incredibly violent. Life as you know it in America is about to be disrupted in a serious way. By the way, I also predict that Edward Snowden, Julian Assange and Anonymous will all play key roles in these unfolding events, exposing mind-blowing government secrets that spur populations across many western nations into escalating their action against the corrupt government regimes they've foolishly allowed to rule over them. Much of the real war taking place across our globe right now is a cyber war... a ""war of secrets"" where the hackers and cyber activists are increasingly exposing all the corruption and criminality of governments, which maintain their power by constantly lying to the public and withholding the truth. The political establishment as we know it today will not survive intact When it's all said and done, if Trump wins the presidency, the political establishment as we know it today will be obliterated on multiple levels. For starters, the people have already lost faith in the establishment system, and if things escalate, it's not difficult to envision a near future where Hillary Clinton is imprisoned while people like Huma, Lynch and Eric Holder are tried for treason. Even if Clinton does win the election and occupy the White House, the global end game is fast approaching anyway. A Clinton White House only further encourages the calls for revolt across the population, and Hillary's deep corruption and criminality is so despised by nearly all soldiers and police officers that it's hard to imagine her being able to demand respect from either of those groups. In fact, it's a lot easier to imagine a military coup against President Clinton that it is to imagine a successful eradication of the Second Amendment by her presidency. Even if Clinton ordered police across America to go door to door and confiscate all the firearms of private citizens, what cop would be stupid enough to even attempt such a suicide mission? I can't overstate this point: Things are at a breaking point in America, and the only thing holding back a mass revolt right now is the looming election, which presents at least a glimmer of hope to the people of America that they might beat back tyranny and government oppression with a Trump victory. If that possibility is taken from them -- either by the election being stolen at the ballot box or already pre-stolen by outrageously biased media deceptions -- many of them will conclude that they really have no remaining option other than ""refreshing the Tree of Liberty with the blood of patriots and tyrants"", to quote Jefferson. America has nearly reached the fulcrum of rebellion ""We Are at a Point Where the Encroachment of Government Power Has Historically Resulted in Rebellion,"" explains this article at The Daily Sheeple (originally from ZeroHedge). What Washington elites utterly fail to realize is that for many Americans, they have nothing else left to lose if they lose this election. They've already lost their job and their health coverage. In many places across America, they're losing their own national flag and national pride. They've been ridiculed, condemned and spat upon by the dishonest media and the crybully leftist f--ktards, and they realize full well that if they don't draw a line in the sand right here, right now, they're going to be disarmed, enslaved, impoverished and named ""enemies of the state"" in the very same country they once fought for (and pledged allegiance to). The psyche of real America has reached its last straw. With the culture under attack, the Constitution demonized, religious beliefs targeted for merciless condemnation and the industrial base of America utterly gutted beyond restoration, there is nothing left to surrender to the demands of the tyrannical left. It is at that breaking point where, in the minds of many citizens throughout history, they pick up pitch forks and march en masse against the oppressors in power. We are very, very close to that day in America. It may, in fact, unravel in just the next 100 days. No matter who wins this election, mass violence breaks out across America in one way or another. Never hope for Civil War... be careful what you ask for Remember: Civil War would be a disaster for America, which is one reason why globalists like George Soros are pushing so hard for it. We should never wish for open bloodshed and nationwide chaos. As one voice of reason commented on The Burning Platform page: The last civil war was disastrous for the US  not just in lives and destruction of property, but in turning what had been a truly positive political structure instantly into something much more corrupt. I see no reason to think that another civil war won't do the same. Yes, we are being pushed towards another civil war quite deliberately. Resist the push. Figure out the real problem and go after it. I do not know exactly what the problem is, but it certainly seems to be a small group of fantastically wealthy and evil people who are using the rest of us like a sociopathic 10-year-old might fry ants. These people need to be identified and blocked from power. Soros seems to be a prominent person among them, but the various other usual suspects seem likely to be the problem as well. Questions to ask yourself in all this How will you feed yourself if social chaos halts food deliveries to your local grocers? Do you possess a means of self-defense that does not depend on dialing 911 and praying somebody shows up to save you? Do you live within walking distance of the inner cities? If so, prepare to be overrun by raging, violent, angry extremists who respect no law and actually murder police every chance they get. Do you depend on financial payments from the federal government? How would you survive if those payments stop coming? If you own firearms, do you know how to use them effectively and safely? When was the last time you practiced with them, or cleaned them? Do you have spare parts? Ammo? Cleaning supplies? When was the last time you checked the battery on your red dot sight? Stock up on supplies now at the Health Ranger Store, offering storable organic food, laboratory verified water filters, essential oil emergency medicine kits, Ranger Gear survival tools and much more."

102,vulnerability,The_Donald,Khizr Khan Deletes His Law Firm Website,233,4vttcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4vttcu/khizr_khan_deletes_his_law_firm_website/,2016-08-03 03:58:58,"From BB: Khizr Khan, the Muslim Gold Star father that Democrats and their allies media wide have been using to hammer GOP presidential nominee Donald J. Trump, has deleted his law firms website from the Internet. This development is significant, as his website provedas Breitbart News and others have reportedthat he financially benefits from unfettered pay-to-play Muslim migration into America. A snapshot of his now deleted website, as captured by the Wayback Machine which takes snapshots archiving various websites on the Internet, shows that as a lawyer he engages in procurement of EB5 immigration visas and other Related Immigration Services. The website is completely removed from the Internet, and instead directs visitors to the URL at which it once was to a page parking the URL run by GoDaddy. The EB5 program, which helps wealthy foreigners usually from the Middle East essentially buy their way into America, is fraught with corruption. U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has detailed such corruption over the past several months, and in February issued a blistering statement about it. Maybe it is only here on Capitol Hillon this island surrounded by realitythat we can choose to plug our ears and refuse to listen to commonly accepted facts, Grassley said in a statement earlier this year. The Government Accountability Office, the media, industry experts, members of congress, and federal agency officials, have concurred that the program is a serious problem with serious vulnerabilities. Allow me to mention a few of the flaws. Grassleys statement even noted that the program Khan celebrated on his website has posed national security risks. There are also classified reports that detail the national security, fraud and abuse. Our committee has received numerous briefings and classified documents to show this side of the story, Grassley said in the early February 2016 statement. The enforcement arm of the Department of Homeland Security wrote an internal memo that raises significant concerns about the program. One section of the memo outlines concerns that it could be used by Iranian operatives to infiltrate the United States. The memo identifies seven main areas of program vulnerability, including the export of sensitive technology, economic espionage, use by foreign government agents and terrorists, investment fraud, illicit finance and money laundering. Khan spoke alongside his wife Ghazala Khan at the Democratic National Convention last week in Philadelphia, and they were honoring their son U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khana hero who lost his life to a suicide bomber in Iraq in 2004. On behalf of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic nominee for president, Khizr Khan ripped into Donald Trumps policies on immigrationspecifically bashing his plan to bar Muslim migration from regions afflicted with rampant terrorism into America temporarily until the United States can figure out whats going on. Khan even brought out a pocket Constitution, claiming inaccurately that Trumps plans were unconstitutional. Thats not true, as Congress has already granted such power to the president under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952allowing the president to bar migration of any alien or class of aliens the president sees as a threat to the United States for any reason at any time. Such a class of aliens could be Muslims, or it could be people from a specific region of the world, or any other classsuch as someones race, weight, height, age, national origin, religion, or anything else. The media, along with Hillary Clinton and her supporters throughout the Democratic Party establishment, has pushed the line of attack against Trump for days. Now on Tuesday, President Barack Obama has said that Trump is unfit to serve as President over the matter. Even a group of anti-Trump congressional Republicans has gone after Trump on the matter. But as Breitbart News and other new media have exposed Khans various deep political and legal connections to the Clintonsand to Muslim migrationthe attack line has crumbled. Now, with Khan deleting his website in an apparent effort to hide his biographical information, the attack is falling apart even more. Whats perhaps interesting is that also on this website that he has now deleted, Khan revealed that he spent nearly a decade working for the mega-D.C. law firm Hogan &amp; Hartsonnow Hogan Lovells LLPwhich connects him directly with the government of Saudi Arabia and the Clintons themselves. Saudi Arabia, which has retained the firm that Khan worked at for years, has donated between $10 million and $25 million to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton, despite the repeated urging of Trump, has refused to return the Clinton Cash money to the Saudis. Whats more, Hogan Lovells also did Hillary Clintons taxesand helped acquire the patents for parts of the technology she used in crafting her illicit home-brew email server that the FBI director called extremely careless in handling classified information. Whats more, the entire mainstream has proven negligence with regard to this matter as none of them even thought to look into this Khan guys law practice before bandying him about as some kind of magic elixir that cures the country of Trump.

Here's the response from WTP including O's response: We the People - A response to your petition on Black Lives Matter Thanks for participating on the We the People platform. You recently signed a petition asking the Administration to ""Formally recognize Black Lives Matter as a terrorist organization."" In the wake of the tragic recent events in Dallas, Falcon Heights, and Baton Rouge, the President brought together law enforcement officials, civil rights leaders, activists, faith leaders, academics, and state and local elected officials this week to encourage frank conversations about the steps we can take together to build trust and ensure justice for all Americans. As part of these conversations, the President directly addressed the concern that the ""Black Lives Matter"" slogan, social media movement, and the associated protests are somehow inherently anti-police: **""I know that there are some who have criticized even the phrase 'black lives matter,' as if the notion is, is that other lives don't matter. And so you get 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter.' I understand the point they're trying to make. I think it's important for us to also understand that the phrase 'black lives matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African Americans that needs to be addressed. It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter. It's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability. ""And so we shouldn't get too caught up in this notion that somehow people who are asking for fair treatment are somehow, automatically, anti-police, are trying to only look out for black lives as opposed to others. I think we have to be careful about playing that game, just because that's not obviously what is intended."" This is a difficult time for our nation and this is a charged debate that stirs deep emotion. Speaking at the memorial service in Dallas earlier in the week, the President emphasized that progress requires, in part, Americans on all sides to stand in each others shoes and look at the world through each others eyes. He added: ""With an open heart, those protesting for change will guard against reckless language going forward, look at the model set by the five officers we mourn today, acknowledge the progress brought about by the sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas, and embark on the hard but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation. ""With an open heart, police departments will acknowledge that, just like the rest of us, they are not perfect; that insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals. And I understand these protests -- I see them, they can be messy. Sometimes they can be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt. Protestors can get hurt. They can be frustrating. ""But even those who dislike the phrase 'Black Lives Matter,' surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling's family  and know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can, without putting officers' lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost. ""With an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and worry more about joining sides to do right. Because the vicious killer of these police officers, they won't be the last person who tries to make us turn on one other. The killer in Orlando wasn't, nor was the killer in Charleston. We know there is evil in this world. That's why we need police departments. But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart. We can decide to come together and make our country reflect the good inside us, the hopes and simple dreams we share.""** -- The We the People Team "

In the wake of the tragic recent events in Dallas, Falcon Heights, and Baton Rouge, the President brought together law enforcement officials, civil rights leaders, activists, faith leaders, academics, and state and local elected officials this week to encourage frank conversations about the steps we can take together to build trust and ensure justice for all Americans. As part of these conversations, the President directly addressed the concern that the ""Black Lives Matter"" slogan, social media movement, and the associated protests are somehow inherently anti-police: ""I know that there are some who have criticized even the phrase 'black lives matter,' as if the notion is, is that other lives don't matter. And so you get 'all lives matter' or 'blue lives matter.' I understand the point they're trying to make. I think it's important for us to also understand that the phrase 'black lives matter' simply refers to the notion that there's a specific vulnerability for African Americans that needs to be addressed. It's not meant to suggest that other lives don't matter. It's to suggest that other folks aren't experiencing this particular vulnerability. ""And so we shouldn't get too caught up in this notion that somehow people who are asking for fair treatment are somehow, automatically, anti-police, are trying to only look out for black lives as opposed to others. I think we have to be careful about playing that game, just because that's not obviously what is intended."" This is a difficult time for our nation and this is a charged debate that stirs deep emotion. Speaking at the memorial service in Dallas earlier in the week, the President emphasized that progress requires, in part, Americans on all sides to stand in each others shoes and look at the world through each others eyes. He added: ""With an open heart, those protesting for change will guard against reckless language going forward, look at the model set by the five officers we mourn today, acknowledge the progress brought about by the sincere efforts of police departments like this one in Dallas, and embark on the hard but necessary work of negotiation, the pursuit of reconciliation. ""With an open heart, police departments will acknowledge that, just like the rest of us, they are not perfect; that insisting we do better to root out racial bias is not an attack on cops, but an effort to live up to our highest ideals. And I understand these protests -- I see them, they can be messy. Sometimes they can be hijacked by an irresponsible few. Police can get hurt. Protestors can get hurt. They can be frustrating. ""But even those who dislike the phrase 'Black Lives Matter,' surely we should be able to hear the pain of Alton Sterling's family  and know that his life mattered to a whole lot of people of all races, of all ages, and that we have to do what we can, without putting officers' lives at risk, but do better to prevent another life like his from being lost. ""With an open heart, we can worry less about which side has been wronged, and worry more about joining sides to do right. Because the vicious killer of these police officers, they won't be the last person who tries to make us turn on one other. The killer in Orlando wasn't, nor was the killer in Charleston. We know there is evil in this world. That's why we need police departments. But as Americans, we can decide that people like this killer will ultimately fail. They will not drive us apart.

117,vulnerability,The_Donald,[Serious] An InfoSec worker's perspective on Clinton's email server,4,4l1lf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4l1lf2/serious_an_infosec_workers_perspective_on/,2016-05-26 06:05:40,"I was reading [this recent article](URL about Clinton's email server, and upon reading this: &gt;The inspector generals review also revealed that hacking attempts forced then-Secretary of State Clinton off email at one point in 2011, though she insists the personal server she used was never breached *I couldn't help but open my mouth in awe.* This part is *really incredible* to me. *One* email server with *one* IT person supporting it as a side-job *does not* a secure, mature environment make. Knowing the technology involved - likely an Exchange server with a stateful firewall in front and *hopefully* a separate Active Directory instance or other directory services provider - and the difficulty inherent in keeping even small environments 'secure', combined with knowing that the IT person in particular wasn't even that competent, makes it seem extremely unlikely that the server was as well protected as it should have been. Hell, this arrangement would be considered *stretching it* even if she had only been working for a small business. And given the nature of the server, the sensitivity and value of its contents, and the parties which would benefit from those contents - other states - it seems very likely that it was in fact breached. If there was a limit to the scope of the breach, it ironically may have been from one actor preventing another from following them in. **Their IT person:** 1\. Admitted that it was *""under attack"" two times* in 2011. *This is the State Department*. In much smaller environments, automated vulnerability scans and other forms of attack are completely routine and happen *constantly*. Where I work, it's an *every day occurrence*. At a minimum, achieving a base level of security against generic threats *(let alone the state-sponsored threats)* involves investing significant money and time into ensuring that: * All systems are up to date, configured according to best practices, and protected by multiple levels of security (firewall, intrusion protection software, antivirus or host-based IPS, network segmentation, egress monitoring, etc) * There are ways of monitoring for security threats and for throwing alarms if potential breaches occur * Any relevant logs, from the email server or from network devices or anything else in scope, are quickly aggregated and archived to serve as an auditing trail, which is regularly backed up to mitigate any opportunity to tamper with the logs * Policies/procedures exist to regulate investigating these anomalies, follow up with remediation, and determine the scope of the compromise / whether data was lost * Processes exist to notify relevant third parties as to security threats and any potential compromise or data loss Had these controls been in place (and these are *bare-minimum*, a State agency ought to have *far more* controls in place), the IT guy would have not believed that they were only targeted once or twice. I know for a fact that the third bullet point was not, because if that was in place (and it is arguably one of the most important up there!) then more than the email server itself would have been confiscated. The fact that such logs were not also seized implies that either (1) we didn't hear everything about the investigation and they neglected to mention a key piece of the audit trail, (2) the investigators don't know what they're doing and didn't think to request the audit trail, or (3) no such logs were maintained. If he only detected attacks once or twice in that many years, it doesn't mean the server wasn't targeted - it means that *there was no intrusion detection system* or other adequate monitoring system in place to even know about attacks, unless those attacks were so clumsy and amateur as to cause obvious user-facing problems. And these clumsy, amateur attacks are precisely the ones *least* likely to do actual damage. 2\. ""Shut off the server"" to keep out hackers As if that somehow fixes whatever vulnerability they were aiming at, or they'll just go away if the email server is down for a day or two? Government agencies, as well as large companies, face ""APT""s or ""Advanced Persistent Threats"". These threats: * **Are typically state-sponsored or run by sophisticated criminal organizations.** They are patient and careful. Their attacks will be subtle and intentionally hard to notice without significant effort and money invested into monitoring, and moreover, they are likely to exist on a system over a long amount of time while quietly exfiltrating data away. They will not hit a server once or twice over the course of a year, much less using obvious and noticeable methods, and then go away because they have to wait a few days for a server to come back online. * **Have advanced means with which to attack** They have excellent technological knowledge and ability to exploit vulnerabilities that exist in systems, even access to ""0-day"" vulnerabilities that are known by, and can be purchased only on, the black market. These are vulnerabilities that their IT worker would not have known about, and can only be defended against by a defense-in-depth approach, combined with proactive monitoring of the network/systems for traces of threats. (Imagine, if you will, attempting to defend a country against invaders. It would be a bad idea to leave cities, roads, critical infrastructure, etc, undefended while investing everything into building a long trench around the country, all while not having a good enough map to know where subways and tunnels are, and no one watching the perimeter or inside of the country to see if they're sneaking over or have embedded agents. That's why defense in depth is important.) Finally, anyone who works in InfoSec knows that, generally speaking, *there is no such thing as a state of being 'secure'*. There are varying degrees, perhaps, but it is impossible to be absolutely secure. An APT, given enough time, *will* inevitably achieve a level of success due to human or machine error. And if this is true of F500 companies and essentially every government agency - including those which followed security procedures and implemented far-reaching controls which would have been nearly impossible to implement/maintain by one person to begin with, even if they were extremely talented - *then it was likely true of her email server as well.* The question isn't *whether* her server was hacked, it's: *how long* was it hacked, and what *didn't* the hackers get?"

Sharia law is the body of Islamic law. The term means ""way"" or ""path""; it is the legal framework within which the public and some private aspects of life are regulated for those living in a legal system based on Islam. * 1. **The mosque &amp; state are not separate.** * 2. **Jihad may be waged against injustice or an unjust nation.** * 3. **Jihad may be waged to spread Islam.** * 4. **A captive in jihad may be executed, enslaved, ransomed for money, exchanged for other prisoners, or released freely.** * 5. **A woman captive of jihad may be forced to have sex with her captors.** Captors basically means owners in Islam. * 6. **Property can be destroyed or confiscated during jihad.** * 7. **Jihad may be waged to collect spoils.** Don't have resources? Time for holy war... * 8. **A second-class submission tax, called the *jizyah*, must be imposed on Jews and Christians living in Islamic countries.** It's not only Jews &amp; Christians, it's everyone who doesn't follow Islam. * 9. **Slavery is allowed.** We fought the battle already, we collectively decided: fuck slavery, they want it back, though I suppose in their countries it never went away. * 10. **A male owner may have sex with his slave-women, even prepubescent slave-girls.** * 11. **Slaves may be beaten.** * 12. **Apostasy laws, including imprisonment or execution, may be imposed on anyone who leaves Islam.** * 13. **Blasphemy laws, including imprisonment or execution, may be imposed on critics of Islam or Muhammad.** * 14. **Drinkers and gamblers may be flogged.** * 15. **The hand of a male or female thief may be cut off.** * 16. **Homosexuals may be imprisoned, flogged, or executed.** We've heard a lot about this law recently, homophobia to the extreme. * 17. **Fornicators may be flogged/Adulterers may be stoned to death.** * 18. **A woman inherits half what a man does.** * 19. **A woman's testimony in a court of law counts half of a man's testimony, since she might ""forget.""** And still women defend Islam, jesus, fucking, christ. * 20. **A man may legally and irrevocably divorce his wife, outside of a court of law, by correctly pronouncing three times ""you are divorced.""** * 21. **A wife may remarry her ex-husband if and only if she marries another man, has sex with him, and then this second man divorces her.** * 22. **Husbands may hit their wives.** * 23. **A man may simply get rid of one of his ""undesirable"" wives.** * 24. **A mature man may marry a prepubescent girl.** Why not, after all their glorious prophet did it. * 25. **A woman must wear a head covering and maybe a facial veil, according to sound traditions and authoritative classical law.** * 26. **Under Islamic law an only be proven if the rapist confesses or if there are four male witnesses.** Women who allege rape without the benefit of the act having been witnessed by four men (who presumably develop a conscience afterwards) are actually confessing to having sex. If they or the accused happens to be married, then it is considered to be adultery. This is by no means a 100% list of everything included in sharia law, just some of the bigger offenders. The one other thing I didn't include because I'm unsure if its sharia or not, is taqiyya. There are several forms of lying to non-believers that are permitted under certain circumstances, the best known being taqiyya. These circumstances are typically those that advance the cause of Islam - in some cases by gaining the trust of non-believers in order to draw out their vulnerability and defeat them. This is why there are so many muslims saying it's a religion of peace. They know damn well it isn't and they know their culture isn't peaceful either. Their book allows them to lie to our faces so of course they will. Now for fun links about muslims and how they feel. [Percent of Muslims who favor making Islamic law the official law of their country.](URL [WZB Berlin Social Science Center: 65% of Muslims in Europe say Sharia is more important than the law of the country they live in.](URL [PO (2014): 43% of Islamic teachers in Austria openly advocate Sharia law over democracy.](URL [Center for Social Cohesion: 40% of British Muslim students want Sharia](URL [ICM Poll: 40% of British Muslims want Sharia in the UK](URL [NOP Research: 68% of British Muslims support the arrest and prosecution of anyone who insults Islam](URL [World Public Opinion: 81% of Egyptians want strict Sharia imposed in every Islamic country 76% of Pakistanis want strict Sharia imposed in every Islamic country 49% (plurality) of Indonesians want strict Sharia imposed in every Islamic country 76% of Moroccans want strict Sharia imposed in every Islamic country](URL [World Public Opinion: 64% of Egyptians said it was very important for the government to apply traditional punishments for crimes such as stoning adulterers.](URL [Pew Research (2010): 82% of Egyptian Muslims favor stoning adulterers 70% of Jordanian Muslims favor stoning adulterers 42% of Indonesian Muslims favor stoning adulterers 82% of Pakistanis favor stoning adulterers 56% of Nigerian Muslims favor stoning adulterers](URL This is who we are inviting in. Now, is every single muslim bad? I'd like to think not.

I've decided to spend my fathers day to help break down thse 'points' and show you just how stupid they really are and how they just ignore every fact they can to help push their narrative. I wonder if they want to push the 'Racist Trump' narrative so much so they can push Hillarys history of racism away? So lets begin shall we? **The Justice Department sued his company  twice  for not renting to black people** Once again this proves that liberals think that Racism is happening whenever a black and a white person enter a room together. Their story: Federal investigators also gathered evidence. Trump employees had secretly marked the applications of minorities with codes, such as No. 9 and C for colored, according to government interview accounts filed in federal court. The employees allegedly directed blacks and Puerto Ricans away from buildings with mostly white tenants, and steered them toward properties that had many minorities, the government filings alleged. True Story: It's like they forgot about what the word 'Alleged' means. This was during the housing crisis of the 70's a time which had many claims of Racism including the one labeled above as part of a Racial housing crisis. That led to the Fair Housing Act.They don't know that the claims originally came from a couple who were FIRED from Trumps business's and THERE IS NO DOCUMENTATIVE PROOF FOR THESE CLAIMS. The only sources for the C and 'NO.9' claims only came from a couple who were former employees of Trump. In reality however they were denying people of all races including white people because THEY ARE ALL ON WELFARE, and if these Hillary supporters ever took a class on Business they would quickly know how that is FAR in the interest in the Business man as it's been know to evaporate property value and forcing a Business to settle has been a problem for YEARS and what big business's have to deal with all the time. Now it's no secret that a majority of people on welfare at the time were minorities, but unless you wanna claim that Trump is the reason why minorities were on welfare then you have no claim at all. The claims against were never even proven and was not found at fault during the court mandated settlement. I mean later they say ""were quoted in court documents as saying they were told that the company wanted to rent only to Jews and Executive"" Which is funny because if you follow all other claims of Racism against Trump he went from treating Jews as VIPS to being Racist against them. &gt;One black woman, for example, was turned away at a heavily white complex but told that she should try to obtain an apartment at Patio Gardens, where a black judge had recently become a tenant, according to government filings. So is he just Racist against Black Women and not Black Men? Or was a Judge more likely to be in a good economical sound position? Once again, it's almost as if liberals want a Race war to happen. They just point the finger at anything and TRY to make a racial issue. URL **Discrimination against black people has been a pattern in his career** Both of their examples are literally 'He Said, She Said' examples and the major claim by the FORMER EMPLOYEE of O'Donnell who is someone who was FORCED TO RESIGN and then WORKED FOR A COMPETITOR. It says so RIGHT IN THERE SOURCE. Need I say more? If you want to claim that as proof then you need to take this as proof as well: URL since it has MORE credibility as it comes from a legal representative. **He refused to condemn the white supremacists who are campaigning for him** They refer to David Duke most of the time, I'm honestly shocked by how little they give a shit about lieing. Trumps Comments on him Trump: I hate seeing what it represents, but I guess it just shows theres a lot of hostility in this country. Theres a tremendous amount of hostility in the United States. Nov 19, 1991 The Reform Party now includes a Klansman, Mr. Duke, a neo-Nazi, Mr. [Patrick] Buchanan, and a communist, Ms. [Lenora] Fulani. This is not company I wish to keep.  Trump, in a statement saying he will not accept the Reform Party nomination for president, Feb. 13, 2000 Trump: Well, youve got David Duke just joined  a bigot, a racist, a problem. I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. remarks on NBCs Today Show, Feb. 14, 2000 Trump: I dont need his endorsement; I certainly wouldnt want his endorsement. I dont need anyones endorsement. -Aug 16, 2015 Trump: I didnt even know he endorsed me. David Duke endorsed me? Okay, all right. I disavow, okay?  Trump, in response to a question at a news conference, Feb. 26, 2016 But what I heard was various groups. And I dont mind disavowing anybody and I disavowed David Duke. And I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference. I have no problem disavowing groups, but Id at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group if the group shouldnt be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke.  Interview with NBCs Today Show, Feb. 29 2016 We had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question. I said I disavow. Now, right after the program that were talking about  and I thought it was clear, but you know, were talking about groups, groups, groups. I do have to know the name of the group because, who knows? I mean, they have to give me the name of the group. But right after, when I reviewed it, I put out a tweet and I put out on Facebook that I totally disavow. Now everybody knew I did that but the press refused to look at that. It was right after. And I disavowed then; I disavowed today on ABC with George Stephanopoulos, I disavowed again. I mean, how many times are you supposed to disavow? But I disavow and hopefully its the final time I have to do it. But if you look at Facebook and if you look at Twitter, right after the show I put out a statement because I want everybody to be sure. March 1, 2016 Are you even trying? Also a little Byrd told me: URL URL URL ""Friend and Mentor"" **He questions whether President Obama was born in the United States** I'll give you this one, he did that and I think it was dumb. I'm not exactly sure why you think it was Racial issue and is Hillary a racist as she took part in the 'Birther' movement too according to her Chief Strategist Mark Penn? The idea of going after Obamas otherness dates back to the last presidential electionand to Democrats.  Hillary Clintons chief strategist, Mark Penn, recognized this potential vulnerability in Obama and sought to exploit it.  Penn wrote:  [H]is roots to basic American values and culture are at best limited. I cannot imagine America electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally American in his thinking and his values. Penn also suggested how the campaign might take advantage of this. Every speech should contain the line that you were born in the middle of America to the middle class in the middle of the last century, he advised Clinton. And talk about the basic bargain as about [sic] the deeply American values you grew up with, learned as a child, and that drive you today. He went on: Lets explicitly own American in our programs, the speeches and the values. He doesnt  Lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds [of campaign events]. URL And is believed to have began to grow roots by CLINTON supporters URL URL **He encouraged the mob justice that resulted in the wrongful imprisonment of the Central Park Five** If you read the article that he bought the front page for for:URL You'll notice two things. 1. He doesn't mention the races of the suspects ONCE and 2. Claimed how ALL races couldn't feel safe in New York. If anything it's a issue relating to the Death Penalty and the lack of a good police force in the 80's. Trumps insterest in it was due to him being a proud New Yorker and was probably pissed to see people fleeing the city. The article is mostly about getting rid of the violent crime that is crippling New York. YOU ARE THE ONLY ONES MAKING IT A RACE ISSUE.

120,vulnerability,The_Donald,The Madman,55,4hkna0,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/4hkna0/the_madman/,2016-05-03 10:13:31,"I am a medical student who studied Neuroscience in undergraduate. This is my analysis on the rise of Donald Trump. I published this in my schools paper. Sorry, it is very long It is May 2nd, 2016. The GOP Elite, mainstream media, liberals and politicians the world over lie battered and dazed. Against all odds and the endless narrative that Donald Trump is a joke and inevitable loser, Donald Trump wins the US GOP nomination in a landslide. Of the 36 states that have voted, Trump has won 26 and polls indicate he will win 8 of the remaining 11 states in landslides. In total he will likely have won 34 of the 47 voting states. In the CURRENT YEAR, he has already received more votes than any GOP nominee in history, despite starting with 17 opponents and competing with two candidates remaining even after being mathematically eliminated. He has done this despite not allowing anyone to donate to his campaign (only allowing his supporters to buy campaign gear). Furthermore, he has only spent about 40 million (of his own money) during his campaign, which is about 25% of what the other candidates, both Rep and Dem, have spent individually. It doesnt end there. He has had approx 60,000 negatives ads, totaling hundreds of millions, against him, far far more than any other candidate received. Every single major news network and almost every single social media outlet or local news outlet actively campaigned against him in an attempt to bring him down. Not to mention the radical activists supporting Sanders' constant efforts to silence him and his supporters. His numbers, his methods, and his opposition mark his victory as the single greatest performance in US politics to this day. His detractors, detailed above, cannot begin to imagine how they got to this day; the day when the media and the GOP elite and even the fervent radical leftists supporting Sanders metaphorically bend the knee, accepting their defeat and beginning their support of their conqueror. The clown, the joke, the *buzzword* had won. But how did he do it? Well he told you his strategy from the start. He told you he was going to ""build the wall, and Mexico will pay for it."" Everyone laughed, everyone cried ""idiot!"", everyone roared outrage at the very idea that another country would voluntarily pay for the US project. People could not understand this concept. But there was an parallel concept no one thought of, not the media, the democrats, nor the GOP elite. Their hatred of Donald Trump and effort to paint him as a horrible man and an idiot, their fixation and obsession with his ""outrageous"" statements funded his campaign. You see, the sanders/clinton supporters, CNN, Fox, etc. all paid for his campaign through media coverage. Without even realizing it, they were Mexico, paying for the border wall. It is this irony that shows how wrong everyone was about Trump. Just as the democrats and GOP inadvertently paid for Trump to win, so will Mexico pay for the wall after Trump is president (CUCKS STUMPED). All Trump had to do was make a statement that would cause outrage but could be skillfully ""corrected"" with some political and verbal maneuvering and in return he would receive endless media coverage amounting to over $2 billion worth in ad spending. But wouldnt he lose his support with all these comments? A normal candidate would but not Donald Trump. He did something different from every politician. For decades and decades, every serious presidential contender has pandered to irrational minority groups, assuming the rational majority of all races (the working middle class) would simply divide their vote equally. This was true every time, rational white/black/hispanic people just wanted whoever they thought was most qualified, and thus no politician bothered pandering to them. And in a time when your average white, straight, normal, whatever, person is under massive attack by radicalized liberals/minorities just for existing (AIDS Skrillex comes to mind), a new voter block developed, consisting mainly of moderate repubs/dems and independents, people who just wanted to mind their own business and get along with others. These people never did anything to deserve the constant attacks and accusations they began to receive, in K-12, in university, in the workplace, wherever. These people, in addition to the more conservative republicans and more liberal democrats, were drawn to Trump. It was to all these people that Trump pandered. Trump believes that a person should be judged by their accomplishments, not by their skin color, their gender, their sexual orientation. This mindset is shared by the majority of Americans, bar the radical right and radical left (looking at you cruzlims &amp; berniebots &amp; BLM). This used to be the mindset of minorities as well, until the radical left decided that it was only your skin color and sexual orientation that was important and that current Americans should be held responsible for the actions of people from hundreds of years ago. Now that they are assaulted by ideas they can categorize only as extremely radical and oppressive, they are pissed. Every single poll this year has said that 90% of Trump's supporters will never leave him. The aforementioned changes in America have made them entirely devoted to Trump, and the reaction he has received by illegal immigrants, millennial activists have only made them more stalwart and committed. According to Newton's 3rd Law of physics, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. The Trump Effect is that reaction. Every single convert to his side is now someone fully committed to the cause, a centipede. The sheer force of will of these Americans will Make America Great Again. Of that, I have no doubt. About Clinton. She has no chance. None. I predict the greatest GOP victory since Ronald Reagan. While some opposition to Clinton is rooted in sexism (ie, bernout supporters), there is also some (likely lesser) opposition to Trump rooted in sexism (ie extreme feminists &amp; regressive left). So why will he win? How can you stop Trump? As we have all learned, you cannot stump the Trump (foolish GUAC bowl merchant). You see, Trump has already been hit by every single attack humanly conceivable in the primary (racism, sexism, bigotry, islamophobia, idiocy, corruption, dishonesty, etc, etc) and nothing has worked. Again, he won, in a landslide despite people literally rioting in the streets against him. Hillary is much the same, having been attacked on a great many things. Nonetheless, I would argue that she is not nearly as invincible to attack as Donald Trump is and there are still various attacks to use against her in the upcoming GE, which really cannot be said for Trump. In fact, people will be resigned to all the buzzwords used against Trump, it will be old news. Even bad news doesnt have much effect when its old news. (As a side note, I also believe many liberals will come to realize that all the buzzwords made against Trump were blatantly untrue and merely part of politics. Once people finally see that they have been manipulated by these buzzwords, they will wake up, and see the entirety of reality. They will OD on the red-pill. Once awakened to reality, it is impossible to fall back asleep). Besides the difference in vulnerability, I believe the emotion both candidates evoke in their supporters will be the most important determinant of the victor. Many voters for Clinton support her because she is a woman who has achieved much in what was previously a man's world. I wholeheartedly agree. Her record is not without tarnish, there are many mistakes (where in the world is Ben Ghazi?). In addition to this, many voters believe it is time for a woman president. Also true (Ivanka 2024). The problem with these two aspects is that they dont make for a wholeheartedly devoted voter base. It just isn't the feel that amps you up to go to a rally and scream Lyinnnnn Ted! ya know? Trump meanwhile is also successful, and is one of the richest people in the world. He has a 3% business failure rate when the average rate of business failure is 95%. At the same time, he talks like an average person, not a politician. Thus, his voters often see him as the picture of the American Dream, they can see themselves as Trump, much like Clinton's voters aspire to be as successful as she. The difference is his words. He has the best words. Believe me. He says what he means and he means what he says. He doesn't hold anything back (Fuck the PC Nazis). Trump is literally inside of his voter's heads, he is practically the average person's inner thoughts projected into an ultra-successful presidential candidate's body. These people dont doubt a single thing he says because, to them, that would be the same as doubting their own thoughts. Thus, he becomes the most relate-able candidate that will ever exist. And in each individuals own life, he or she is the protagonist, the hero, of every story. And as Disney has so endlessly drilled into our beliefs: you can never defeat the hero.* *Also, the polls already have him beating Hillary. cucks stumped. MAGAAAAA "

For those unaware, Tiktok is a Chinese ""social media platform"". Except in reality they aren't, **they are just a part of China's propaganda machine, and they have done some really fucked up things**. Here's a quoted comment (can't link to it because of rule 7) that explains why you should boycott it fairly well. Also no hard feelings to the mods if you want to remove this for not being directly Trump related. &gt;I'm curious why people are using TikTok to make video gifs these days. &gt;TikTok Admits It Suppressed Videos by Disabled, Queer, and Fat Creators. URL &gt;TikTok has been accused of secretly gathering ""vast quantities"" of user data and sending it to servers in China. URL &gt;TikTok is paying the FTC a fine of $5.7 million for collecting the data of kids under 13. URL &gt;TikTok censors all reference to the Hong Kong protests. URL &gt;TikTok has had children as young as 8 targeted by sexual predators and Police are urging parents to check the app privacy settings. URL &gt;URL &gt;TikTok's privacy page admits to collecting as much data as possible, from meta data, GPS location, and pulls all contact information on someone's Facebook and instagram (if connected) and phone, while allowing themselves to use this data for whatever they want. &gt;URL &gt;TikTok has been labeled a ""threat to national security"" by the USA government. &gt;URL &gt;URL &gt;URL &gt;TikTok is ban from US Navy mobile devices, as it's been declared a cybersecurity threat. &gt;URL &gt;TikTok had vulnerabilities as recent as last month, which allowed attackers to gain control of users accounts to upload videos or view private videos, while a separate flaw allowed attackers to retrieve personal information from TikTok user accounts through the companys website. &gt;URL &gt;Its almost as if Tiktok is Chinas attempt at pushing their propaganda out to the world while also having massive privacy issues. China has realized that to control the global population you have to control social media and what people see. So for the last year they have been pouring a ton of money into getting their social media app to be accepted and widely used- through a campaign of paid content creation/submission, and vote manipulation. Once they have widescale buy in, their backdoor monitoring and data collection will have free reign. &gt;I find it a worrying trend how easily Reddit is blindly up-voting these video gifs and supporting a company with such privacy concerns, an obvious agenda, and that is censoring and controlling the information you see. It's not too late to do something."

The alert warns if a hacker gained physical access to certain small planes, they could attach a common device to its wiring. This could provide false flight data including altitude and airspeed, as well as possible access to the autopilot system, potentially leaving a pilot unable to tell whether the reading was accurate and potentially lose control of the aircraft. ""We could do basically anything the plane can do, pretty much anything the pilot could do by himself,"" said Tod Beardsley, director of research at cybersecurity firm Rapid7. [URL"

Unredacted. The NSA have his electronic communications of his campaign. They recorded the transition until he left the Trump tower. They have everything... But Hillary &amp; crowdstrike redacted this? And even after the election no one has asked for the unredacted version? Are you kidding me? &amp;#x200B; From Gateway Pundit &amp;#x200B; The DOJ recently informed the[ court in a filing](URL in response to Roger Stones motion to compel unredacted Crowdstrike reports that it doesnt even posses the unredacted reports on the so-called hack of the DNC servers. The DNCs lawyer provided the Crowdstrike reports to the US government with redactions and claimed the redacted parts were not relevant to the investigation. And surprise, surprise  the FBI never looked into it. By May 2016, the DNC and the DCCC became aware that their computer systems had been compromised by intrusions, and they hired the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike to identify the extent of the intrusions and mitigate the threat, the filing stated. Right, because going to the FBI wasnt an option for Hillary and her camp  they hired a Deep State friendly cybersecurity firm to crank out reports for them and magically it was confirmed that the Russians hacked the servers and were given code names Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. Former FBI Director James Comey testified that the FBI asked the DNC for the compromised servers several times and they refused to hand them over to the bureau. Instead of taking the servers, Comey and the DNC agreed that CrowdStrike would investigate the so-called hack and they ultimately churned out three draft reports. According to the court filing, Copies of these reports were subsequently produced voluntarily to the government by counsel for the DNC and DCCC. At the time of the voluntary production, counsel for the DNC told the government that the redacted material concerned steps taken to remediate the attack and to harden the DNC and DCCC systems against future attack. And did the FBI further look into the redactions? NOPE! The FBI just trusted the DNCs lawyer that there was nothing relevant behind the redactions. According to counsel, no redacted information concerned the attribution of the attack to Russian actors, the filing stated. So there you have it. CrowdStrike gave the US government three draft reports on the so-called hack which was full of redactions and the FBI just took their word for it that the Russians hacked the DNC servers."

I have posted a little about the Mueller report before here, it fascinates me to no end how open and transparent your democracy is. Something like this report would never see the light of day in Europe. The reason I write this, I did some light reading into this story. I started with the Papadop story because he was the named reason for the start of this counter intelligence operation on June 31, 2016. So, like they sang in the sound of music in the song do-re-mi, let's start at the very beginning.  The report: The meat of the report starts at page 9 (the first 8 pages are the index) and it starts with Papadopoulos. This is the third paragraph of the 9th page of the report, the first 2 are introductory: ""In late July 2016, soon after WikiLeaks' s first release of stolen documents, a foreign government contacted the FBI about a May 2016 encounter with Trump Campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos. Papadopoulos had suggested to a representative of that foreign government that the Trump Campaign had received indications from the Russian government that it could assist the Campaign through the anonymous release of information damaging to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. That information prompted the FBI on July 31, 2016, to open an investigation into whether individuals associated with the Trump Campaign were coordinating with the Russian government in its interference activities. ""  That may 2016 encounter can be found in the Papadop testimony (in closed session) before congress, this is Papadops testimony under oath (page 42 of his testimony): ""Question: Did Russia come up in the conversation with Downer? Answer: That's the point. I don't remember Russia ever coming up in a conversation with him. I just remember him telling me that he was an envoy to Cyprus, a U.N. envoy and that my ideas in that part of the world are very wrong. He was just very belligerent. I mean, it was a very hostile meeting. BY MR. BREITENBACH: Question: Were you inebriated or drunk during that meeting? Answer: Fortunately, the one thing he has corrected is that we weren't drunk, and we had one drink. Question: I'm sorry, you were not? (the news reports of that meeting claimed that Papadop was drunk and blabbed his mouth:URL ) Answer: We were not drunk. I was certainly not drunk, and I don't believe he was either.""  Anyway, that's the may meeting according to Papadop, and how the the investigation allegedly started. This is paragraph 4 of page 9 of the Mueller report. It gets really weird and this is what I want to talk about. remember, this is just the second paragraph with substance:  ""That fall, two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations,"" and, ""[t]hese thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process."" After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election. By early 2017, several congressional committees were examining Russia's interference in the election.""  The thing is, this is a really odd paragraph for a number of reasons, so I will split them up:  1) The 2 federal agencies statement(I included it here in total, we will get back to it but just notice the date: oktober 7, 2016): ""Joint Statement from the Department Of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Election Security Release Date: October 7, 2016 For Immediate Release DHS Press Office Contact: 202-282-8010  The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscowthe Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.  Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.  Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber hygiene scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials. source: URL  2) ""After the election, in late December 2016, the United States imposed sanctions on Russia for having interfered in the election."" Just look up what Obama had to say about election interference before that date: URL So according to Obama on 18 oktober 2016, there is no evidence of rigging or hacking. Now, time to dig into the press release I mentioned in my first point, the one released 11 days before Obama's statement.  If you like music, put on The Doors - Strange Days right now.  First of all, let's introduce you to the leadership of those 2 federal agencies named by Mueller in paragraph 4 that authorized the press release. (Before I forget, I know Mueller was talking about this press release because I pasted this sentence from paragraph 4 into DuckDuckGo.com(for those of you that don't know what duckduckgo is, it's google with a robuster privacy protection, but if you paste the same sentence into google, you get the same result:  ""two federal agencies jointly announced that the Russian government ""directed recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including US political organizations""  it's verbatim in the press release)  Player One: Head of the DNI in 2016: James Clapper (URL  Player two: Head of DHS in 2016: Jeh Johnson (URL  Now, I think I don't need to tell you about Clapper, but just to be sure, he is the one that handpicked a couple of people from 3 agencies that wrote the infamous ""17 intelligence agencies"" report. (URL   Enough is said about him. The one I am interested in is player two, Jeh Johnson.  Here is why I am interested in him, his testimony before congress, under oath, on June 20, 2017. (URL  This is a direct quote from the testimony by mr. Johnson, 7 months after that press release: ""On August 3, 2016, in an on-the-record session with reporters, I publicly floated the idea of designating election infrastructure in this country as critical infrastructure. Twelve days later, on August 15, I convened a conference call with secretaries of state and other chief election officials of every state in the country. I told state officials that we must ensure the security and resilience of election infrastructure, and offered DHSs assistance to the states in doing that. I also reiterated the idea of designating election infrastructure as critical infrastructure. To my disappointment, the reaction to a critical infrastructure designation, at least from those who spoke up, ranged from neutral to negative. Those who expressed negative views stated that running elections in this country was the sovereign and exclusive responsibility of the states, and they did not want federal intrusion, a federal takeover, or federal regulation of that process. This was a profound misunderstanding of what a critical infrastructure designation would mean, which I tried to clarify for them.""  Now why is that? why didn't they want to cooperate? It isn't in the Mueller report, but I have a decent memory and I know there was a very good reason f"

WHERE ARE THE DNC SERVERS!?,21,8ym2d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/8ym2d3/repost_a_timeline_about_crowdstrike_and_the/,2018-07-14 03:41:44,"Alright guys, I'm tired of hearing about ""muh Russia"", ""COLLUSION"" and the often regurgitated talking points. So lets start from the beginning. THE RUSSIA NARRATIVE As far back as 12-21-2015 the Clinton campaign has been trying to equate Trump to Putin. URL And again on 04-27-2016 URL Both emails stemmed from leaks published by Wikileaks. The first one, a result from Podesta falling for a phishing scam URL . The phishing email was targeted by google as being from Ukraine (MUH RUSSIA) but what is stopping someone from using an Ukrainian proxy to hide their real location? The second email is from the DNC leaks, which Wikileaks claims it DID NOT come from Russia URL ""BUT BUT BUT so you believe everything Wikileaks says to be true? Of course they're gonna say it didn't come from Russia!"" No, I don't believe everything Wikileaks says to be 100% true, however, their track record is quite impeccable. Nonetheless, instead of taking Wikileaks by their word lets actually look at the claims that the DNC leaks came from Russia. Crowdstrike was the cybersecurity firm that claimed that the DNC leaks came from Russia, however, their methods have been criticized and their claims seem to be overreaching URL Moreover, they had access to the DNC servers and if they had access they must be right, after all there must be multiple people with access to these infamous servers that came to the same conclusion, right? WRONG. THE MOTHERFUCKING FBI was denied access to the DNC servers during the hacking probe URL AND, Crowdstrike refused to testify in front of congress URL (Good timeline read on Crowdstrike URL ""BUT BUT BUT another420username, 17 intelligence agencies have said that Russia HACKED THE ELECTION!!"" WRONG! During the Clapper/Yates hearing Clapper cleared that only the CIA, NSA, and FBI made such claim URL and hell, it was all because they signed under a report that ""exposed"" the ""hacking"" URL ""OH! But this report says it all! THERE WAS HACKING!"" WRONG AGAIN! The report stated ""The General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) probably began cyber operations aimed at the US election by March 2016. We assess that the GRU operations resulted in the compromise of the personal e-mail accounts of Democratic Party officials and political figures. By May, the GRU had exfiltrated large volumes of data from the DNC. Public Disclosures of Russian-Collected Data. We assess with high confidence that the GRU used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets. (...) We assess with high confidence that the GRU relayed material it acquired from the DNC and senior Democratic officials to WikiLeaks. Moscow most likely chose WikiLeaks because of its selfproclaimed reputation for authenticity. Disclosures through WikiLeaks did not contain any evident forgeries"" *Notice the usage of the language ""with high confidence"" In no way shape or form the report states how this was achieved or how they reached such conclusion. Instead, the report goes on to lay all the blame on RUSSIA TODAY! And the best part comes at the end when it explains the estimative language used ""High Confidence generally indicates that judgments are based on high quality information from multiple sources. High confidence in a judgement does not imply that the assessment IS A FACT OR A CERTAINTY; such judgments might be wrong"" And the cherry on top on this whole thing is Clapper openly stating that there isn't proof of collusion URL TLDR; BILL CLINTON IS A RAPIST!

On March 20, 2017 during testimony before congress, James Comey stated ""CrowdStrike, Mandiant, and ThreatConnect review[ed] the evidence of the hack and conclude[d] with high certainty that it was the work of APT 28 and APT 29 who are known to be Russian intelligence services.""[20] However, the FBI did not independently verify these findings because the DNC refused to give the FBI access to the server.[21] In December 2016, CrowdStrike released a report[22] stating that Russian government-affiliated group Fancy Bear had hacked a Ukrainian artillery app. They erroneously concluded that Russia had used the hack to cause large losses to Ukrainian artillery units. The app (called ArtOS) is installed on tablet PCs and used for fire-control.[23] The earliest version of the app (supported until 2015) was called POPR-D30 and installed on Android phones and tablets. CrowdStrike found a hacked variation of POPR-D30 being distributed on Ukrainian military forums that utilized an X-Agent implant. However, they failed to show that the hacked variation of POPR-D30 was actually installed by any Ukrainian soldiers.[24][25] The International Institute for Strategic Studies, whose data on Ukrainian D30 howitzer losses was misused by CrowdStrike in their report, rejected CrowdStrike's assessment of hacking causing losses to Ukrainian artillery units. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense also rejected the CrowdStrike report, stating that actual artillery losses were ""several times smaller than the number reported by [CrowdStrike] and are not associated with [Russian hacking]"".[26] Cybersecurity firm Secureworks discovered a list of email addresses targeted by Fancy Bear in phishing attacks.[27] The list included the email address of Yaroslav Sherstyuk, the developer of ArtOS.[28] However, there is no evidence that they succeeded in hacking Sherstyuk's email."

146,cybersecurity,The_Donald,MYSTERY: Did Fusion GPSs Nellie Ohr Evade NSA Surveillance With A Ham Radio?,55,81gj8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/81gj8f/mystery_did_fusion_gpss_nellie_ohr_evade_nsa/,2018-03-03 05:38:33,"URL MYSTERY: Did Fusion GPSs Nellie Ohr Evade NSA Surveillance With A Ham Radio? by Joshua Caplan Nellie Ohr, the wife of Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, was hired by Fusion GPS for the purpose of digging up dirt on then-presidential candidate Donald Trump. One curious detail about Mrs. Ohr is that she obtained an amateur radio license on May 23th, 2016. Was evading NSA surveillance the motivation behind obtaining the license? George Parry of The Federalist writes: Ohr is a member of Women in International Security, which describes itself as supporting research projects and policy engagement initiatives on critical international security issues, including the nexus between gender and security. She has done cybersecurity consulting for Accenture, a politically connected firm, for which she gave a presentation on Ties Between Government Intelligence Services and Cyber Criminals  Closer Than You Think? [] It is apparent that, between her own professional experience and her marriage to a top DOJ official, she was well aware of the ability of the National Security Agency to intercept and store every communication on the Internet. Did this knowledge have anything to do with her mid-life decision to become a ham radio operator and communicate outside cyberspace? [] On May 23, 2016, she received a technician-level amateur radio license. The timing is significant. The presidential campaign was underway and she and her employer, Fusion GPS, were digging for dirt in Russia to use against Trump. Given her cybersecurity knowledge, was Nellie Ohr hoping to use non-cyber short wave communications to hide her participation in that nefarious effort from the NSA? Recall that, in early 2016, NSA head Admiral Mike Rogers became aware of ongoing and intentional violations and abuse of FISA surveillance, which he subsequently exposed in testimony before Congress. Thereafter, pressure mounted within the Obama administration to fire him. Another unanswered question is did Fusion GPS use Ms. Ohr to influence top government officials? If the answer is no, then why did the recently demoted Ohr hide his wifes Fusion GPS compensation from ethics officials? Daily Caller reports: Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committees behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show. The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted. The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the dossier. Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm. Payments from Fusion GPS to Bruce Ohrs family, funded by the DNC, have the appearance of a government for hire, i.e. bribing a DOJ official to push the case, says the Daily Callers Luke Rosiak. Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton said more attention should be paid to Bruce Ohr in relation to the dossier drama. The fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee is bringing in Bruce Ohr, this Justice Department official involved with Fusion GPS and the Clinton dossier, shows you where the collusion scandal is, Fitton told OANNs John Hines last December. Its with the Clinton campaign, the DNC, the FBI, the Justice Department, said Fitton before asking, how did they use this dossier? How did they use this dossier? Was Mueller using this dossier? Was it used to justify to a court to get warrants to spy on Trump and his team? Thats the collusion, added Fitton. Bruce Ohr is the first indication that we have that the Justice Department was involved in this dossier thats been so controversial."

[Op-Ed],13,7milt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7milt2/can_muellers_team_be_sued_for_assaulting_and/,2017-12-28 10:15:11,"--- **Intro and Motivation** Given what we know now in late Dec, 2017, the continuance of the obvious witch hunt of Mueller's ""Special Council"" is now causing harm to the American people, because it's sending a signal to our culture and to our legal system that *""presumption of innocence""* doesn't matter--it is false. Because if a group can do this to the highest position in america--the President of the United States--they can certainly do this same thing to you: ***lawfare***. Dragging out a legal matter, well beyond its intended scope and time frame, causing grievous harm to taxpayers who have to shoulder the burden of the same, while also insulting and accusing not just the lawfully-elected President but all of those who voted for him. In a way, this accusation of election meddling with no evidence to support it--with plenty of evidence to disprove the same--is an attempt not only to reverse a disfavorable political decision by the oppositional team, ...the continuance of the special council in light of the many legal, political conflicts-of-interest of the Special Council team members, and the failure of the MSM or Council to consider counter-evidence that undeniably creates sufficient doubt to stop the investigation, are simply ways to insult, humiliate and infuriate half the country, by assaulting their presumption of innocence, with what could be considered a discriminatory, political assault, whose unreasonable extension can be considered malice, stalking, lawfare, libel, slander, and conspiracy. Is it possible for Mueller's Team to be sued in a class-action lawsuit for assaulting and degrading *common law, specifically the Presumption of Innocence*, or if not, for essentially waging psychological, nonlinear warfare against the American public? Are there any legal scholars out there know the answer to this question? This lawsuit would not be intended to ""stop an investigation"" because it will likely stop itself from having no evidence. This lawsuit would occur after the investigation, as payback for the assault on our way of life. It would be payback for dragging this thing--and the american people--through the mud for over a year. You don't get to do that without accepting the consequences of your action. Someone once said, I think it was John Taylor Gatto: ""Lawsuits are how assholes communicate to each other"", and trust me on this, Mueller needs a stiff talking-to. --- **Presumption of Innocence** From the Wikipedia article on the [Presumption of innocence](URL &gt; Although the Constitution of the United States does not cite it explicitly, presumption of innocence is widely held to follow from the 5th, 6th, and 14th amendments. The case of [Coffin v. United States (1895)](URL established the presumption of innocence of persons accused of crimes. See also [In Re Winship](URL In re Winship is described as follows: &gt; In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970), was a United States Supreme Court decision that held that ""the Due Process clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime charged.""[1]:17 It established this burden in all cases in all states (constitutional case).[1]:17 The decision did not specify which facts constitute the charged crime ...and Coffin v. United States is elaborated thusly: &gt; The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law ... Concluding, then, that the presumption of innocence is evidence in favor of the accused, introduced by the law in his behalf, let us consider what is 'reasonable doubt.' It is, of necessity, the condition of mind produced by the proof resulting from the evidence in the cause. It is the result of the proof, not the proof itself, whereas the presumption of innocence is one of the instruments of proof, going to bring about the proof from which reasonable doubt arises; thus one is a cause, the other an effect. To say that the one is the equivalent of the other is therefore to say that legal evidence can be excluded from the jury, and that such exclusion may be cured by instructing them correctly in regard to the method by which they are required to reach their conclusion upon the proof actually before them; in other words, that the exclusion of an important element of proof can be justified by correctly instructing as to the proof admitted. The evolution of the principle of the presumption of innocence, and its resultant, the doctrine of reasonable doubt, make more apparent the correctness of these views, and indicate the necessity of enforcing the one in order that the other may continue to exist. Given that Russiagate has been [discredited 33 ways from Sunday](URL with evidence ***against*** it growing daily and [supporting these collections of facts](URL over 8 months ago to the present--it is safe to say that ""reasonable doubt""--a qualification for maintaining the presumption of innocence and exoneration of the same crime must be observed.

At a Tuesday news conference at the headquarters of the foreign policy think-tank Atlantic Council in Washington, D.C., the group plans to announce it's working on a list of necessary procedures and standards that state and local election officials must do, such as implementing digital firewalls around election data and making sure there are paper ballots to allow for auditing of all election tallies. It has given itself a 60-day deadline to produce the guidelines. The group also plans to pressure Congress to fund the election officials' activities ""because if the states and local election officials have one gripe we have to concede to them, its that theyre broke,"" said Jake Braun, a former senior consultant on cybersecurity at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in the Obama Administration who is helping organize the coalition. ""If we have a nation state attempting to influence the U.S. electoral process, then its the federal governments job to pay for the defensive response."" The goal is to have the strongest, most unhackable system possible in place by the 2020 presidential election, he said. Concerns over foreign interference in last year's presidential election were heightened by last month's Department of Homeland Security announcement that election systems in 21 states had been targeted by Russian government hackers during the 2016 election campaign. It's ringing alarm bells, said Frederick Kempe, chief executive officer of the Atlantic Council, which is leading the effort. If we want to defend our democracy, then we need to protect our elections, he said. In July, hackers at the DefCon cybersecurity conference were able to break into five voting machine types in less than a day, underscoring the vulnerability of the U.S. election system. The group also plans to release a report on how the hackers were able to so swiftly hack the machines, a feat that raised red flags because the industry that operates voting systems had always said they were more protected from intrusions because they required such specialized knowledge to run. The voting machine hacks destroyed that argument, said Jeff Moss, president of DefCon and a commissioner on the The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace. The interior of a Diebold Election Systems voting machine. It was taken apart by at the DefCon computer security conference in Las Vegas as part of an event aimed at raising awareness about vulnerabilities to the U.S. election system. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) The Atlantic Council is chaired by Jon Huntsman, the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Russia. In his statement to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last month during his nomination hearing, he said there was no question that the Russian government interfered in the U.S. election last year and that he would ""not hesitate to remind government officials that they are accountable for their actions."" Russia has consistently denied any interference in the U.S. election. Also in the coalition is the Center of Internet Security, a non-governmental organization that is funded by the Department of Homeland Security to fund cybersecurity for states and cities. While Russian attempts to insert itself into the U.S. political process were a surprise here, they were not news to those who have worked in the military and diplomatic corps. Many of our European allies have already seen this  years of Russian interference and Russian attempts to erode the credibility of the political process in Central and Eastern Europe, said Ambassador Douglas Lute, a retired three-star general who served under both Obama and George W. Bush and was most recently the former United States Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council, NATOs standing political body. He's part of the coalition. And if what Russia did in 2016 was bad, what it might do in 2018 or 2020 with the knowledge it gained the first time around is worse, Lute said. By law, states must maintain statewide voter registration databases, many of which were probed in 2016. You can imagine a hacker could get into these databases, then do something as simple as misspelling names or transposing numbers in the address. Then when the voter goes to the polling place and shows his ID, he doesnt even get a ballot, Lute said.

I would like to recommend everyone about this story, specifically because the source material (DNS logs) is available to examine and the fact that [Mrs. Clinton tweeted about it](URL [Could Alfa Bank Servers Be the Link Between Trump Campaign and Kremlin](URL This whole event about capturing Trump Tower connections showing DNS lookups to Alfa Bank is where a Russian connection narrative can actually be examined, and where illegal wiretap claim comes into play (in which I will return to). You get [arguments like this](URL in response Trump's claim of Obama wiretaps. &gt; If federal authorities did have cause to listen in on Trump Tower, though, and they **provided enough evidence** for a FISA court to approve the snooping, Obama is not the one who ought to worry. Now, arguably, just simple [DNS lookups isn't definitive proof of guilt](URL but why stop there? Hammer it. Disarm this line of speculative fallacy. The only log that exists contain 4 flaws. * &gt; FLAW #1: Wrong IP address for client destination * &gt; FLAW #2: Wrong client format * &gt; FLAW #3: Wrong time format * &gt; FLAW #4: Recursion-desired bit set This has been compiled from this [examination of the logs](URL It was recovered by multiple web archives before it was removed. The main issue and summary from this examination is this. &gt; The other objections dont address the elephant in the room: **the logs that have been clearly manipulated to look like BIND9 logs**. The reason I chose this is because its better engage at the source based accusations instead of speculative and immeasurable ones like, ""What're Russia's propaganda mission with and the effects of [RT and Sputnik](URL However, I will get to the Crowdstrike narrative shortly. So this was used as reasonable suspicion to justify a FISA Warrant. Is this really the standard for investigations? Where false and flimsy evidence is pursued and real crimes are not? We had an FBI that can't confirm or deny the existence of an any investigation but [Ex-Director James Comey, himself, announced the existence of classified emails on Clinton's private server and devices and that work related emails were not all turned over.](URL [Hillary Clinton's setup was not encrypted either](URL or [secure](URL and her severs and devices could have been [vulnerable to hacking](URL while she was the Secretary of State. It doesn't stop there, we even had the Colin Powell, Former Secretary of State, [instructing Hillary Clinton how to work around the State Department server and use blackberries](URL The [email](URL in particular (check the [PDF attachment](URL Wikileaks published to the Hillary Clinton Email Archive. A common complaint to Wikileaks is that they're doctored, like [Donna Brazile claimed](URL However these emails are particularly easy to verify through [a simple test](URL In Colin Powell's case however, Hillary's own [corroboration with the FBI](URL simply proves this. We have Hillary [getting her maids to print out classified documents](URL We had a round of cover-up or ""oddities"". Hillary [got a Contractor to delete and overwrite ""Non-work related"" emails on her server with the help of Bleachbit while a subpoena was still pending](URL Sorry for Hillary, but the BleachBit creator states that [any deleted emails may be recovered through a 3rd party ISP](URL She also had [blackberries destroyed with hammmers](URL and arguably [not destroyed thoroughly](URL enough for prevention of data recovery. Inspite of all that, we get this! Bryan Pagliano, who installed and maintained a private server for Hillary, who originally [plead the fifth](URL was [granted immunity](URL by the the DOJ. The man who was instructed to destroy the emails, a Platte River Networks employee, [misled and refused to answer important FBI questions](URL Cheryl Mills also and specifically [refused to answer FBI questions about Clinton Emails](URL Oddly enough [Cheryl Mills was there with Hillary Clinton in an FBI interview](URL invoking attorney-client priviledge even as a witness to the same alleged crime as Clinton gave [bizarre answers about her phones and her past knowledge of classification](URL Hilary Clinton also had the luxury getting FBI agents to sign a [Non-Disclosure Agreement](URL Clinton and also [avoided Larry Klayman's FOIA requests](URL by the help of the DOJ. Now at the State Department we more witnesses such John Bentel, the Director of S/ES-IRM, who works as an IT at the State Department [plead the fifth](URL He also had an IT Manager working for him, named Cindy Almodovar, who was [never questioned by the FBI](URL And it all goes back to Hillary [circling around FOIA](URL So now, what is our solution as the FBI? Lets not pursue a [single case or charge of any kind](URL Lets setup a strawman legal argument about [""intent"" to commit crime](URL Lets not care we [didn't interview all witnesses](URL before coming to multiple flip-flopping conclusions and then finally [draft exoneration papers at the FBI](URL All of this in summary is why these premises deserves scrutiny and why everyone hates the hypocrisy, contrarian, doubletalk, and partisan mindset of these narratives being perpetrated by the media and even our own government. Now, back to the CrowdStrike narrative about claiming [Russians hacked the DNC](URL First of all, CrowdStrike isn't only criticized for its DNC hack claim, but its credibility also comes into question with claims about how [Russia targeted Ukrainian Artillery](URL IISS themselves criticize CrowdStrike by claiming that [no losses or hacking occurred](URL The report itself lives up to [scruntiny](URL Before trying to explain forensics for profiling hackers we must understand why [attribution isn't foolproof](URL What I find striking are these two points made by Cybersecurity researcher and consultant, Jeffrey Carr: 1. Why attribution **alone** doesn't work in cybercrime accusations. &gt; When it comes to cybersecurity estimates of attribution, no one holds the company that makes the claim accountable because theres no way to prove whether the assignment of attribution is true or false unless (1) there is a criminal conviction, (2) the hacker is caught in the act, or (3) a government employee leaked the evidence. 2. An [Intelligence analysis](URL done by Maj. Robert D. Folker, Jr. in 2000 published by the Joint Military Intelligence College. &gt; ""After reading the scenarios members of the control group formed a conclusion, then went back to the scenario to find evidence that supported their conclusion and ignored contradictory evidence. When asked to justify their answers, analysts in the control group often cited some key information that gave them a flash of insight."" &gt; ""Members of the experimental group examined all evidence provided in the scenario prior to making their decision. They felt confident that they were making the best decision they could with the amount of information available. They acknowledged that their decision may not be the right one and added that if more evidence became available they would reevaluate their conclusion taking into account this new information."" Carr also states, &gt; ""Many of the cyber intelligence analysts who work at companies like CrowdStrike, FireEye, and Mandiant have come out of the military or the Intelligence Community with prior analytic training."" Many fall victim to making conclusions first then reaffirming them with evidence, but especially when interpreting things such as cybercrime and warfare. Another thing mentioned by Carr, &gt; Unlike Crowdstrike, ESET doesnt assign APT28/Fancy Bear/Sednit to a Russian Intelligence Service or anyone else for a very simple reason. Once malware is deployed, it is no longer under the control of the hacker who deployed it or the developer who created it. It can be reverse-engineered, copied, modified, shared and redeployed again and again by anyone. In other words  malware deployed is malware enjoyed! In fact, the source code for X-Agent, which was used in the DNC, Bundestag, and TV5Monde attacks, was obtained by ESET as part of their investigation! During our investigations, we were able to retrieve the complete Xagent source code for the Linux operating system. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this Xagent source code has been found and documented by security researchers. This source code is a fully working C++ project, which was used by Sednit operators to compile a binary in July 2015 (at least). If ESET could do it, so can others. It is both foolish and baseless to claim, as Crowdstrike does, that X-Agent is used solely by the Russian government when the source code is there for anyone to find and use at will. So now that the innate plausible deniability of this type crime has been examined, lets see what possibilities exist with public malware. Wikileaks [released CIA documents](URL known as [Vault 7](URL that covers the CIA intensive and sophisticated computer [hacking programs](URL Remember earlier that the malware is up for grabs upon release? Well the [CIA collects malware](URL from other hackers as well and this shows an effect tactic and potential plausible deniability at play. Now, while I'm not suggesting that the CIA breached the DNC like some [articles](URL do, I am suggesting this is a legitimate technique that hackers use and that its difficult to find a suspect with attribution, let alone finding involvement with government or state-party. It is almost worth nothing to adopt or tweak other persons software, but more time and resources are required to originally create software. Since the CIA had severely damaged everyone's security in the process of this cyberweapons arsenal buildup, [Assange himself offered to help companies fix exploits in their software](URL In addition even though hacking capability is important for the CIA, they also have the ability to [attribute false ""fingerprints""](URL to cyber attacks, covered under the group named UMBRADGE. More evidence that compiling software for false attribution to malware is possible. So now that the claim of Russian hacking itself is weakened, is there anything that contradicts the report? While I don't think it is necessary at this point to continue because of the speculative nature of attribution, and the fact that the burden of proof lies with the claimant. Although I don't fully agree, I will list the counter arguments against the Russian Hack narrative to be fair. 1. [Warren Flood's, a data-analyst for Obama](URL name was found in the [metadata of the Guccifer 2.0 documents](URL While this suggests argues that Guccifer 2.0 was an inside job, its more reasonable that the metadata contradicts the original claim of Crowdstrike, and further proves that attribution is still unreliable. 2. [Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) claims that the download speeds for the Guccifer 2.0 hack would be to fast for internet transfer, making a local transfer more plausible.] (URL It is flawed because it assumes that there are no ISPs or networks that offer connections that fast. However, it still makes the transfer speed implausible for certain parts of the world and certain computer networks with multiple nodes, so this part of the premise is more plausible as to rule out certain attack vectors for the hack. What is the most deadly is that the government and media advance this narrative to be an active and significant player in surveillance, disinformation, and censorship. Now we return to [Trump's claim that Obama illegally wiretapped Trump tower](URL Now we know for fact the NSA already sweeps up and collects most Americans' private data from [Downstream](URL (Indirectly from Websites, Email providers, Social Media, etc.) programs like PRISM [Edward Snowden](URL leaked and [Upstream](URL (Directly from Telecoms or Internet Service Providers) programs like STORMBREW. We even have whistle blower and ex-NSA Technical Director William Binney [reaffirming the nature](URL of the upstream dragnets and ""At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US"". So there's no real reason to argue pointless semantical meanings about the word ""wiretap"" so fiercely. Inlight of these programs, the agencies deny surveillance and active targeting. [Ron Wyden asked Ex-Director of National Intelligence James Clapper](URL if the NSA collects data on Americans. James Clapper responds, &gt; ""No, sir."" This has to be a lie right? Well does intent count if you believe the collection of data is different from analyzing or directly reading it? However it is irrelevant to the topic at hand. Maybe [Clapper does believe so](URL regardless Wyden repeats his question. Clapper now understands and backpedals an explanation, &gt; ""Not wittingly. There are cases where there could inadvertently perhaps collect, but not.. not wittingly."" So, collection still takes place. Thanks for the information, Mr. Clapper. Unfortunately, we are now at this point in time where popular narratives are using [George Bush logic](URL to justify wide-spride surveillance. That logic that simply being affiliated with anyone foreign or the more rare exception, suspected of terrorism in regards national security. Or it could be the fallacious mindset that since Trump is a target of this, then it must be okay. It's a very fallacious contrarian argument. Although, it all seems to be enough reason to convince people to comply with NSA surveillance and collection of American citizens' personal data without a proper court order. However, does it stop there? Well we had [Obama expand the powers of intelligence agencies](URL allowing agencies to share information more easily with fewer restrictions, before he left office. Even if it did what is was suppose to do [(it does not)](URL it also comes with its [abuse](URL and [consequences](URL Also, referring back to Binney he stated in [an interview](URL &gt; They say they dont conduct economic espionage, that theyre not interested in peoples political views, that they dont blackmail internally . . . Is any of that true? &gt; Thats nothing but a series of lies. You could look at the attacks on the Tea Party by the IRS. They had access to the NSAs reconstructed networking of everybody in the country. Not only do these agencies fail but there is fear that data not involved with national security collected by the NSA can be used by other law enforcement agencies through the process of the [unconstitutional](URL [""Parallel Construction""](URL process. So, even if it all worked with no abuse and these agencies all cooperated and pursued these criminals, atleast innocent citizens data is masked, right? Even though citizens are [masked and that citizens and those in the US are targeted more than foreigners](URL the masked data can still be illegally or wrongfully unmasked. Take the case of were an intelligence contractor Dennis Montgomery, Larry Klayman, and others plaintiffs pursue a [lawsuit](URL against against Ex-FBI Director James Comey and other officials. He alleges that millions of Americans were illegally surveilled and unmasked, and that efforts were taken to cover it up. The meat and relevance of the case, &gt; Montgomery divulged to the FBI a pattern and practice of conducting illegal, unconstitutional surveillance against millions of Americans, including prominent Americans such as the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, other justices, 156 judges, prominent businessmen, and others such as Donald J. Trump, as well as Plaintiffs themselves, Montgomery and Klayman alleged in their suit. Plaintiffs were assured that the FBI, under Defendant Comey, would conduct a full investigation into the grave instances of illegal and unconstitutional activity set forth by Montgomery. However, the FBI, on Defendant Comeys orders, buried the FBIs investigation because the FBI itself is involved in an ongoing conspiracy to not only conduct the aforementioned illegal, unconstitutional surveillance, but to cover it up as well, the suit added. Klayman and Montgomery also alleged that they have evidence that they themselves have been improperly spied upon by U.S. intelligence. The suit named numerous other defendants as well, including current NSA Director Mike Rogers, former CIA Director John Brennan and even former President Barack Obama. There was further [elaboration](URL on an Alex Jones Show interview with Detective Mike Zullo, that worked under controversial Sheriff Joe Arpaio, explaining the where Montgomery's information, while a governent contractor, of the surveillance Project Dragnet Database originated and where it went. The case asserts that the database includes Trump, and Alex engages with the screenshot source material with reporter Jerome Corsi of the illegal database on [video](URL The reason I cite this, even though people criticize Infowars, is that this info seems exclusive due to a contractor not knowing where to blow the whistle on the case. It's worth it to sit through the video to collect relevant info. Now, I know you may roll your eyes but the point isn't who is targeted, it is how they are illegally targeted. From all that we know surveillance powers are expanded, abused, and can be politically targeting. Futhermore, we know Trump's assertion that illegal ""wiretaps"" exists is reasonable and true, and If more revelations occur or if the current case gets resolved we may even see Obama administration participation in this illegal surveillance activity and coverup. Now we get to the ""countering disinformation"" campaign that the elites in government and media are trying to start. Not only did Obama expand surveillance powers, he made his very own government based [Correct-The-Record center](URL The [congressional law](URL establishes government to be an active player in the propaganda (A ""Ministry of Truth"", if you will). This was a [bipartisan effort](URL in response to the Russian election interference allegations. Here's its mission: &gt;SEC. 1287. &lt;&lt;NOTE: 22 USC 2656 note.&gt;&gt; GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT CENTER. &gt;&gt; The purpose of the Center shall be to lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter foreign state and non-state propaganda and disinformation efforts Generva posted [a fact](URL sheet about it. Here's the results: &gt; Operating at a local level, our partners use credible voices to deliver messages that resonate with at-risk populations. Our partners include NGOs, schools, young people, social and civil society leaders, religious leaders, governments, and others. We support them through a variety of means including funding, technical assistance, capacity building, and conceiving and implementing joint projects. So, the US government already has an already erroneous, propaganda-based, and abusive view of its politics and citizens. How is this not concerning to people when they are trying to inform us and the next generation? Besides we already private companies [""correcting the record""](URL that don't use taxpayer money for political rhetoric. Similarly, we have the reoccurring terrorism excuse again but from Rand Waltzman, a former DARPA contractor, who wants to [expand this concept](URL further to social media ([archived](URL by presenting it to The American Foreign Policy Council. It's an interpretation using more George Bush logic but dealing with counter intelligence and ISIS. Now, since this narrative crap is trying to delve into social media. What does it mean? It means Youtube targeting specific political ideologies and (not-radical-enough-leftist) by a [de-monetization campaign](URL It means Twitter [suspending](URL accounts that disagree with them or consensus on the site. It means Reddit [policing](URL of ideology of its users. It means Google, the biggest tech company search engine to ever exist, using massive politically motivated [blacklisting](URL You understand that just because you are not a target, doesn't mean you won't become one? I mean they're are even expanding the definition of the word alt-right. &gt; For folks who dont know what the alt-right is, it might be worthwhile to just sort of start at the beginning and talk about what the alt-right isbecause there are a lot of these various definitions floating around, nearly all of which are wrong. This is why this [quote](URL is so significant. Its not just about political assumptions about a movement, its about government and large corporations discarding your concerns in exchange for power. In the end it doesn't care about politics, only that it used those politics to usurp that power. We have Google that has the [power and potential to satisfy the censorship demands of China](URL I mean Facebook helped a [man in Pakistan get sentenced to death](URL [Facebook already assisted Pakistan's blasphemy laws](URL in the past to get to this problem in the first place. Please, smell the coffee and realize these are insignificant or distant problems. This could happen to you. Stop resorting to, ""Oh, we're going to get those hateful rightwingers."" Or, ""Stupid, libtards concerns are invalid."" Now, I don't deny that Russia or any other foreign power would be interested in politcal subsversion, but who doesn't? The story is exploited and beatened to death by George Orwell style repetition. The paradigm is built on a house of sand, it will erode with steady truth. Regardless of your ideology, class, race, or nationality, you all have been targeted bipartisanly for the sake of just power. This is why many people are going to other places to have a competitive market for our next generations ideals. The big tech giants are going to have to keep up with many new platforms.

This excellent narrative was produced by veganmark at WayOfTheBern: The Russiagate Hoax-Cutting to the Chase,109,6tevc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6tevc8/berner_here_this_excellent_narrative_was_produced/,2017-08-13 22:35:01,"Many of you know that I have written a rather comprehensive debunking of the ""Russia interfered in our election narrative that has obsessed the MSM for most of a year. Since its first posting, I have been updating it; its expanded form is available here: <removed> I dont pretend to be an investigative journalist  rather, what I have done is to assemble the findings of respected journalists, intelligence experts, and cyberanalysts who have examined the interference narrative with a critical eye. The links are the best part of my essay, and I refer you to them if you want verification for the views I express below. What I would like to do here is present, in summary form, my own best guess as to what actually happened, in light of the evidence and analyses I cite. Other interpretations are possible, but most of these have a Rube Goldberg-type complexity and illogic that render them quite dubious. Whereas this interpretation fits the known evidence rather straightforwardly: Seth Rich was the source for the DNC emails which Wikileaks published; Assange has been silently screaming this for months, both through statements and tweets, while strenuously denying that the Russian government played any role in this regard. How Seth obtained these emails, and how he conveyed them to Wikileaks, remain to be determined. If the FBI inside source which Sy Hersh discussed in his taped conversation with Ed Butowski is accurate, Seth provided them by drop box, giving Wikileaks the password. There is a recent claim that Seth had had a raucous argument with Donna Brazile regarding DNC unfairness to Bernie; this concern may have motivated Seths leaking, though he may also have sought payment for his risky efforts. On June 12th of last year, Wikileaks announced that it would soon be releasing material pertinent to Hillarys campaign. Whether the DNC knew at this time that Seth was the source is unclear. What is clear is that DNC officials, who had previously been informed that their server had been hacked, quickly decided to convince our intelligence agencies, the press, and the public that Russian hackers, acting at the behest of the Russian government, were the source of the damaging material to be released  in that way, focusing attention on the evil machinations of the Russians, slamming Wikileaks, and detracting attention from the content of the released material. On June 14th, the DNC, in conjunction with the Crowdstrike cybersecurity firm that they had hired, announced that its servers had been hacked, and that a file on Trump opposition research had been taken. An entity dubbed Guccifer 2.0 popped up online a day later, claiming to be the source for the soon-to-be-released Wikileaks DNC material, and obligingly posting a file on Trump opposition research, as well as several other files. Forensic analyses have indicated that the posted documents had had their metadata intentionally altered to leave Russian fingerprints. Moreover, this alteration had occurred on a computer whose MS Office had been registered to the former technical director for Joe Biden, Warren Flood; hence, this computer presumably had been used in the past by Joe Bidens staff. On July 5th, Guccifer 2.0 downloaded from the DNC server a number of additional documents, some of which  all of them relatively innocuous - he subsequently posted on his own website. Forensic analysis of this download indicated that it occurred locally, most likely via USB port, and that it took place on the East Coast. An overview suggests that the Guccifer 2.0 persona was created by people with inside connections to the DNC  on the East Coast, with direct access both to the DNC server and to a computer that had been used by Joe Biden staffers. The evident intent of this charade was to trick our intelligence agencies into concluding that Guccifer 2.0 was the Wikileaks source and was acting at the behest of the Russian government. The fact that he released Trump opposition material a day after the DNC proclaimed that it had been taken by hackers strongly suggests collusion between top people in the DNC and the people concocting Guccifer 2.0. As Adam Carter notes, it is not at all clear how the DNC/Crowdstrike could have known that this particular file had been taken. Carter suspects that principals at Crowdstrike played a key role in creating Guccifer 2.0, as they would have had the expertise required to pull off such a scam. (Whether Imran Awan possesses such skill is not clear.) Five days later (July 10th), Seth Rich was murdered, most likely by hitmen. The DNC might have known by this point that Seth was the leaker to Wikileaks  and that he therefore would have been in a position to completely destroy the Russian interference hoax if he had chosen to do so. Crowdstrike, whose founders are known to despise the Russian government, rapidly concluded that the DNC server had been hacked by Russians affiliated with Russian intelligence. According to experts who have examined this claim, the logic behind this conclusion is unconvincing and puerile. Moreover, Crowdstrike's previous effort to implicate Russian intelligence in a hack had been shown to be bogus. Nonetheless, the FBI chose to accept the Crowdstrike conclusions, even though they had never been able to examine the DNC servers themselves because the DNC had refused to turn them over, and the FBI had failed to subpoena them. If Hershs source inside the FBI is to be believed, the FBI has known for over a year that Seth Rich was a Wikileaks source, and has kept this knowledge secret. The FBI states that they have not participated in the investigation of Seths murder  thereby tacitly implying, without saying so directly, that they have not examined his computer. Given that Assange, who presumably has direct knowledge on the issue, has hinted as strongly as possible that Seth was one of his sources, the FBI would be severely derelict if indeed it has not examined Seth computer(s). The Obama administration was soon fully on board with the Russia interfered narrative, which initially shielded Hillary from the full import of the Wikileaks revelations, and, after the election, provided Hillarys campaign with an excuse for its failure while enabling an ancillary Trump colluded in the interference narrative that could be employed to disable the Trump presidency. Despite Hillarys concocted claim about 17 intelligence agencies verifying the Russian interference story, the Obama administration made sure that the standard appropriate process for our intelligence agencies to provide a balanced evaluation  a National Intelligence Assessment, entailing participation by a number of agencies and including any dissenting judgements  was NOT FOLLOWED. Rather, the histrionic Russophobes James Clapper and John Brennan were allowed to hand-pick a group of a couple dozen intelligence personnel from just 3 agencies. The declassified version of the Intelligence Community Assessment (ICA) which they drafted, free of any dissents, accused the Russian government of a conscious campaign to support the candidacy of Trump by hacking several key political websites and providing their contents to Wikileaks and other outlets. Guccifer 2.0 was specifically cited as a Wikileaks source. Critics immediately noted that the declassified ICA provided no hard evidence whatever to document its claims, and that over half its length was devoted to a criticism of the RT television network as a supposed propaganda outlet. In particular, no insight was provided as to how the authors of the report had concluded that the hacked documents had been transferred to Wikileaks. The conclusions of this report evidently fit seamlessly into a broader strategy of demonizing Russia, the intent being to insure that our military-industrial complex and NATO continue to receive an outrageous level of funding, and that the warped policy agendas of the neo-cons are satisfied. Our MSM immediately embraced the conclusions of the ICA as Gospel truth, frequently referring to our 17 intelligence agencies as the source for this report. They completely ignored the fact that the assessments of this report are in effect just best guesses, that the preamble of the report pointed out that assessments should not necessarily be equated to facts, and that the NSA  which, as William Binney notes, should have been able to obtain definitive proof for any actual hacking that had occurred  expressed only moderate confidence in the conclusions. This sycophantic credulity is particularly inexcusable in the context of the previous Saddams WMDs hoax which they likewise had swallowed uncritically, resulting in an illegal war with utterly catastrophic consequences. The initial claims of Russian interference were soon embellished by media reports claiming that, according to anonymous intelligence sources, the Russian government had attempted to hack into the voter registration files of 21 states, had conducted hacking operations intended to interfere in German and French elections, and had hacked into the Qatari state news agency to plant a fake news story. The veracity of each of these unsourced claims has been called into question, and in some cases disproved, by cyberanalysts, intelligence experts, and journalists. The conclusions of the NSA document leaked by Reality Winner have likewise been shown to be purely speculative. Claims that Russian bots and paid trolls assaulted our social media in the months prior to the election are poorly documented, and, in any case, rather comical. Following the election, the Russian interference narrative was echoed unceasingly by the Democratic establishment, as this was the necessary concomitant of the Trump collusion claims that they were using to slam and cripple Trump  in the hopes of eventually impeaching him. (It presumably would have been hard for Trump to collude in Russian election interference if in fact there had been no Russian interference.) Hysterical attacks on Russia accelerated to the point that some pols referred to the Russian interference as an act of war. This New McCarthyism ultimately led to our Congress placing severe new sanctions on Russia which also harm our European allies, and which these allies decry as illegal. In other words, we are punishing Russia for a crime they almost certainly did not commit, alienating key allies in the process, and amping up a Second Cold War, with all the expense and severe danger which this may entail. All because the DNC and its associates concocted an overt fraud to protect and excuse Hillary, and to use as a cudgel over Trump  a fraud that was readily lapped up and sold to the public by hand-picked Russophobes in our intelligence community, and by a MSM that cares far less about truth than about access and ratings. We need to determine who created the Guccifer 2.0 hoax, and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. The intelligence agents who concluded with high confidence that Guccifer 2.0 was a Wikileaks source need to be fired or demoted. If the FBI has known all along that Seth was a Wikileaks source, those who shielded the public from this crucial information need to be unmasked. The journalists who have been credulously spreading the Russia interfered narrative 24/7 for most of a year, without making the least effort to question the veracity of these assertions, should be recognized by the public as the willing tools of lying warmongers that they are, and their future work studiously ignored. The sanctions recently implemented on Russia should be lifted, and the politicians who played the most egregious role in hyping the Russian interference narrative and pushing the sanctions should be repudiated at the polls when they come up for re-election. (I confess, however, that I will not hold my breath waiting for any of these things to happen.) And lets do our best to find out who murdered Seth Rich, and why. The DNC and its media acolytes have been heaping hysterical abuse on anyone who entertains the possibility that Seth may have been a Wikileaks source, or who undertakes to investigate his murder. Donna Brazile and Seths brother Aaron have done their best to impede the investigative efforts of Rod Wheeler. There is reason to suspect that the DC police have backed off the investigation of the murder, accepting the very dubious view that Seths murder was just a botched robbery. And why did Democratic operatives feel it necessary to supply the Rich family with a ""crisis consultant"" after Assange mentioned Seth - when they couldn't be bothered to offer an award for apprehension of Seth's murderer? This behavior is highly suspicious  if Seth was indeed the victim of random street violence, what would the DNC have to fear from further investigation? Lets get to the bottom of this! *Originally published 8/11/2017 by veganmark at WayOfTheBern "

Bezons controls Amazon, which provides cloud storage on 198 million Republican-leaning voters for a Republican IT vendor. Is the leak of that data purely the IT vendor's fault?",22,6i8s7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6i8s7f/bezos_owns_wapo_which_is_hostile_to_president/,2017-06-20 05:36:54,"Here is an article on the leak: URL The article states that the Republican IT vendor claims sole responsibility, but it also notes that the information on 198 million potentially right-leaning voters was stored on Amazon's cloud. Amazon also landed an enormous contract with the CIA last year, so it likely has the capacity for very strong firewalls and encryption. My question for IT folks is this; is it your understanding that the Republican contractor is solely to blame? I can easily believe that a private contractor, if careless, could drop a firewall on a source of data for a client (in other words, that Amazon is not at fault). But I was surprised to read that the Republican IT contractor chose Amazon for its cloud storage, given Bezos's apparent, and the WaPo's openly-stated, opposition to President Trump's campaign and administration. Sort of seems like asking the fox to guard the hen house."

They literally are blaming Trump for not setting up a program to educate his political opponents on cybersecurity hygiene. "

I feel like I have a good grasp regarding the DNC ""hacks"", but would like to crowdsource this to see if we can get everything in order. **How it's portrayed by the MSM** Russia hacked the DNC and released DNC emails. This is confirmed by 17 intelligence communities who reviewed the evidence and came to that conclusion. **What We know** We know that the DNC said they were hacked. However, despite being a victim of a crime no single government agency has reviewed the DNC Servers, but a single private company, Crowdstrike, did. URL (maybe we should use the left's own sources so they can see how cucked they are?) In that same citation, it states that the FBI relied on Crowdstrike's report. Crowdstrike, the only entity given access to DNC servers. Also, some more sources URL URL 17 intelligence agencies agreeing on Russian hacking is FAKE News. Listen to former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper's testimony. * 3 agencies (CIA, NSA, FBI) * Not all 17 intelligence agencies * Total of two dozen or so people involved URL James Clapper goes on to talk about how these people from 3 agencies found that the Russian government hacked the DNC Servers... but wait, how can they come to this conclusion if they didn't review the servers themselves - instead relying on Crowdstrike's report? To confirm that no government agency had access to DNC servers, let's refer to former Secretary of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson's recent testimony... The DNC, he continued, did not feel it needed DHS assistance at that time. He later added, I was anxious to know whether or not our folks were in there, and the response I got was, the FBI had spoken to them, they don't want our help, they have CrowdStrike. **So What About the CrowdStrike Report?** We have Jeffrey Carr, an expert in the field in cybersecurity writing an article calling the report ""a work of fiction"" URL And here is another article from Carr who proceeds to destroy the report and the DNC's narrative... ""Problem #1: The IP address 176.31.112[.]10 used in the Bundestag breach as a Command and Control server has never been connected to the Russian intelligence services. In fact, Claudio Guarnieri, a highly regarded security researcher, whose technical analysis was referenced by Rid, stated that no evidence allows to tie the attacks to governments of any particular country. "" ""Problem #2: The Command &amp; Control server (176.31.112.10) was using an outdated version of OpenSSL vulnerable to Heartbleed attacks. Heartbleed allows attackers to exfiltrate data including private keys, usernames, passwords and other sensitive information. The existence of a known security vulnerability thats trivial to exploit opens the door to the possibility that the systems in question were used by one rogue group, and then infiltrated by a second rogue group, making the attribution process even more complicated. At the very least, the C2 server should be considered a compromised indicator."" ""Problem #3: The BfV published a newsletter in January 2016 which assumes that the GRU and FSB are responsible because of technical indicators, not because of any classified finding; to wit: Many of these attack campaigns have each other on technical similarities, such as malicious software families, and infrastructure  these are important indicators of the same authorship. It is assumed that both the Russian domestic intelligence service FSB and the military foreign intelligence service GRU run cyber operations. Professor Rids argument depended heavily on conveying hard attribution by the BfV even though the President of the BfV didnt disguise the fact that their attribution was based on an assumption and not hard evidence. When it came to attributing Fancy Bear to the GRU, Dmitry Alperovich used a type of estimative language because there was no hard proof: Extensive targeting of defense ministries and other military victims has been observed, the profile of which closely mirrors the strategic interests of the Russian government, and may indicate affiliation with    (Main Intelligence Department) or GRU, Russias premier military intelligence service. URL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, let's sum this up and feel free to add to this with more sources, please! 1. No single government agency ever reviewed the DNC servers despite the DNC claiming they were a victim of a crime. 2. Jeh Johnson and the FBI understood that the DNC was going to with Crowdstrike to review the servers 3. The Intelligence community consisted of a 'couple dozen or so' people from **3** agencies, not 17. 4. These 3 agencies used Crowdstrike's report as the basis of their evidence 5. Crowdstrike's report doesn't even stand up to the smallest bit of scrutiny. What's even better is Crowdstrike's connection to the White House and Hillary Clinton..I didn't touch on that, but there is a lot of substance there. So, the left's narrative of the DNC being hacked by Russia is nothing more than a conspiracy theory "

[Iowa woman who tried to vote for Trump twice pleads guilty to election misconduct](URL | 8:17 A.M. | *CBSNews* | While this event **did** indeed happen, the article is heavily sckewed to make the reader believe that Trump is **not** investigating both sides of the political spectrum for voter fraud, when he is.

Also, North Korea is an entirely seperate issue from the Russian ""Scandals"". The fact that the article's outlet would blatantly ignore the Senate's findings (much of which include evidence that the DNC may have staged the hackings) only furthers the notion that they are trying to distract the reader from more important and reliable sources.

Also, if the world didn't look to us, why were we part of the 'big table'? The article repeatedly cites caricatures on twitter of Trump sitting at tables while the rest of the leaders were talking, which doesn't explain anything because Trump was up and moving for the entire conference. Maybe he just needed a rest? Still, that doesn't compare to the ironic backlash that Ivanka recieved for her representation at the G20 Women's Empowerment summit. [White House Confuses Taiwan And China In Painful G20 Press Release Blunder](URL | 3:06 P.M. | *The Hill* | The article's argument is based on **two words that were omitted for typing purposes by the White House**. It is very misleading and it is clear the source is attempting to bestow a lack of confidence in the reader to the White House Press Staff. Omitting two words is not a ""blunder"". The pretext ""People's Republic"" doesn't even accurately represent China, a communist nation, so an omission of those words would be appropriate on behalf of the United States of America. **[We Cant Afford a Mentally Unfit Commander in Chief](URL done on July 5th | **3:51 P.M.** | *Washington Monthly* | The article cites a bogus survey done by people **Outside** of the USA.

I just think that's really sad how Democrats insult a woman for her representation in a **Women's Empowerment** international session. [How sad](URL The real truth is, they don't care about Women's Rights. Imagine if Trump attended 100% of that meeting, they would probably insult his facial expressions, the way he was sitting in his chair, or the fact that he ""didn't let Ivanka speak"".

Otherwise, it's all BS. We now bring you back to your regularly-scheduled red-pilling: **Why is the Fake News ""fake""**? The fake news is fake for a number and variety of different reasons: * The funding for these organisations comes from Democrat Wall Street powerhouses, which manipulate the financials and info. * The entire staff is made up of left-wingers, so even the articles not marked ""Opinion"" contain information of opinion with bias. * Most left-wing organisations immediately get high-prestige. * Most sources come from Colleges and Universities, which are mostly left-wing. * There is repeated evidence (almost every day) of news organisations editing or sckewing their info or surveys to the left-wing. #[The Wall Street Journal](URL has actually cleaned up their act within the past year.

Podesta's account was on gmail. He wouldn't have a server to turn over. It would be google who would hand over relevant data and Podesta would turn over his devices. Remember back in February when the FBI announced they were charging 4 hackers from Russia with the Yahoo breach?: URL Well it turns out those hackers were also able to get into gmail accounts: URL Notice the National Security realm of the FBI was able to find the hackers and bring charges. Comey had his own counter-intel investigation and couldn't find any evidence or nail down the hackers. Only one of the people charged has been arrested in Canada. The rest are in Russia. One was jailed by Putin for cooperating with the US CIA. URL He isn't lying when he says his government had nothing to do with it. The Yahoo hackers were working out of a FBI cybercrime office in Moscow. They were supposed to be monitoring hackers yet they helped them. From the NYT: URL ""The criminal conduct at issue, carried out and otherwise facilitated by officers from an FSB unit that serves as the FBIs point of contact in Moscow on cybercrime matters, is beyond the pale."" I believe Podesta and Colin Powell (both on gmail) were part of the Yahoo breach the extent of which wasn't fully known until December 2016. Those hackers gave the emails to 3rd parties who then gave them to Wikileaks and D.C. Leaks. The hackers were working with the US govt. Why did the CIA want Podesta's emails out there and to stop Colin Powell from being able to endorse Hillary Clinton? Patriots in the intel community wanted to stop Hillary from getting to the WH. Re-watch Trump's speech to the CIA: URL He knows what's up. They know what's up. Someone in the CIA knew went rogue. Obama panics and blames Putin. The Yahoo data breach began in August 2013 (4 months after Brennan becomes head of CIA) and wasn't revealed until September 2016 and more in December 2016. Was Obama using Russian hackers to steal our data? Then framing them when someone in the CIA went rogue? Is that why he was so mad at Putin? He thought it was Putin orchestrating it when really it was his own people who sold him out? URL The CIA had identified the hackers. Read the entire article if you have time. So much cognitive dissonance. The CIA also admits the hack could have been made to look like it came from elsewhere. How convenient. This is why Trump says we will never really know who did what. The only carefully planted evidence was against the Trump team. OFA, DNC, Bernie, etc had their own battle over data having nothing to do with Trump. Seth Rich knew about the rigging and probably gave the emails to Uretsky. Uretsky may have leaked them to get back at Hillary for getting him fired. Uretsky's twitter account looks like it could be a fake but he retweets bad info on the Dems: URL Obama's ""database"" was cultivated by the CIA and laundered through the National Security Council. He stole data from everyone via Russian hackers who were supposed to help us fight cyber security. This is why everyone was so triggered when Trump tweeted we were going to work with Putin on cyber security. We tried that already and it failed. In conclusion, Russians DID hack but to HELP Obama. It backfired because someone in the CIA stole the Podesta and Colin Powell emails to help Trump get elected. Why? Because they had seen enough and knew if Hillary won the country was going to fall. Who is the CIA hero? Maybe it was someone in the CIA maybe someone outside government with ties. Flynn? "

The pre-packaged media narrative of Donald Trump as Literally Hitler 2.0 trumps all other moral considerations that comprise the fundamental building blocks of a democratic society; including reason, logic, fairness and balance, intellectual charity and honesty, a sense of proportion and perspective, and so on. These basic values no longer register for today's democrats, living in utter denial about their party, themselves, and the psychopathy they engage in as they continuously project their own wrongdoings onto the fellow citizens they've ""othered"" upon command. Apparently, their only concern is fitting in with whatever mass-media vomit is being force-fed to them at any given time by the talking heads they mistake for brains, and the celebrities they mistake for idols. So they willingly trade away human dignity, decency, and virtue for the safety and comfort of the herd, in search of immunity from stigmatization, free virtue-signaling, and upward social mobility. As long as they play dumb and stay dumb, they calculate that this state of affairs can and will continue, so they become like ruminants, digesting and regurgitating whatever cud they're fed, ad nauseam. Ironically, such human cattle are the end-product of the very system of injustice they claim so earnestly to ""resist"" and to remedy. The sad truth is that today's so-called ""liberal"" democrats, including their vast stable of media whores and the useful idiots who lap up their every word, will simply parrot whatever they're told and generally do whatever they're told, until told otherwise, without any hint of shame or remorse, and certainly without a trace of independent thought. All this while they call their opponents ""fascist,"" ""authoritarian,"" and ""anti-whatever."" As the non-fake-liberal Glenn Greenwald succinctly put it: ""Democrats, still reeling from their unexpected and traumatic election loss, as well as a systemic collapse of their party, seemingly divorced further and further from reason with each passing day, are willing  eager  to embrace any claim, cheer any tactic, align with any villain, regardless of how unsupported, tawdry, and damaging those behaviors might be."""

The day after, a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 claims to have taken credit for the hack and announces he will be giving his documents to Wikileaks.&amp;nbsp;Guccifer 2.0 vehemently denies being Russian, a faade he keeps up throughout his activity. 1. Bolstered by Crowdstrike's report and the metadata in Guccifer 2.0's documents, media outlets immediately start screaming that Guccifer 2.0 must be Russian agents. 1. Finally, Wikileaks releases the DNC documents a month after Guccifer 2.0 did. &amp;nbsp; This post unmasks Guccifer 2.0's identity as none other than the DNC. &amp;nbsp; ## What did Guccifer 2.0 do? Guccifer 2.0 hosted a Wordpress site where the DNC documents could be publicly downloaded. June 15th was the date of the first Guccifer 2.0 leak; further leaks would continue thereafter. I focus only on the first leak, as they contain the metadata which are essential to proving it was a DNC operation.&amp;nbsp; ## What were in the leaked Guccifer documents?&amp;nbsp; Guccifer 2.0 leaked a total of 10 Office documents from the DNC in the first batch (many more would come, but none contain the same ""mistakes"" as the ones I shall detail). &amp;nbsp; All Microsoft Office documents have&amp;nbsp;_metadata_&amp;nbsp;entries which contain attributes about the document itself such as the user that created them, the user that modified them, and so on. This metadata is usually invisible to viewers but can be viewed with a raw text editor like Notepad, or on Mac OS, vim. &amp;nbsp; It would be&amp;nbsp;unusual for a leaker to modify the metadata, but Guccifer 2.0 did, claiming that it was his ""watermark."" &amp;nbsp; In Office, the metadata includes the owner of the Office application&amp;nbsp;**who**&amp;nbsp;**created the file**&amp;nbsp;and the owner of the Office application&amp;nbsp;**who modified the file**. I present a list of the document names having metadata values for original author &amp; modified author: &amp;nbsp; |**Document name**|**Original author**|**Modified author**| |:--|:--|:--| |1.doc|Warren Flood| | |2.doc|Warren Flood| | |3.doc|Warren Flood| | |4.doc|Blake|&amp;nbsp;| |5.doc|jbs836| | &amp;nbsp;  , or Felix Edmundovich in the English alphabet, refers to Felix Dzerzhinsky, an early Soviet statesman and KGB figure who died in 1926. (It's been pointed out in other comments that an actual Russian would never choose "" "" over "" "".) ## So what... Warren Flood, Blake, and jbs836 were the original authors? Short answer: No. Non-technical answer: For one thing, we can cross-reference the actual authors from the Wikileaks dump. 1.doc is in the ""verified"" Wikileaks release as the attachment which can be downloaded [from here](URL which has the original author of ""Lauren Dillon."" So, wait, who is Warren Flood et al? Each of these documents had a creation date of June 15, and were modified by "" "" a few minutes later. &amp;nbsp; In Office 2007 format specification, there is a certain stylesheet template which dictates overall formatting for the document. In three of the documents by Warren Flood, we find the identical metadata. {\s108\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0\contextualspace \rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0\f1\fs20\lang1049\langfe1049\cgrid\langnp1049\langfenp1049\sbasedon0 \snext108 \slink107 \sqformat \spriority1 \styrsid11758497 No Spacing;} The above line appears across all three of Warren Flood's documents. styrsid11758497 is an unique identifier that is session-associative. The fact that it does not appear in the other documents indicates it's associated with Warren Flood and not  . &amp;nbsp; Why is this important? Well, the \langfe1049 portion is a setting saying that Russian language should be used as the default language for the document. &amp;nbsp; Had   been setting the ""watermark,"" it would be the same across all documents. But instead, distinct watermarks were created for each document creator, suggesting inconsistent application or three different creators applying their own watermark. In other words, document creators set the document properties to use Russian language and created three distinct so-called 'watermarks' in doing so, not ' .' &amp;nbsp; Also, cross-reference to Wikileaks shows that Warren Flood did not author any of the documents. And given that the timestamps are all on June 15th, this is the sequence of events: &amp;nbsp; * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood opens a DNC document, copies it, and pastes it as a new document to his computer. * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood sets the theme language to Russian in some way (this process is different for all authors). * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood modifies the document's author to  . * The modified document is then uploaded to the Guccifer website and publicly published a short time thereafter. ## Who is Warren Flood? Warren Flood is a high-ranking technology official for Democratic operatives, having worked for Obama for America, DNC, and Joe Biden.&amp;nbsp; It's a unique name. &amp;nbsp; His name does not appear in any of the Wikileaks emails, meaning that he appears to be a third party as far as the DNC email leaks are concerned. &amp;nbsp; Other than his (professional Internet) profile, he is a virtual social media ghost, never having made any Tweets nor any evidence of real social media activity. &amp;nbsp; The pertinent point is that:&amp;nbsp;**the metadata forensic proof is irrefutable that Warren Flood,&amp;nbsp;**or someone who used a copy of Word registered to Warren Flood**, shoehorned in obvious ""Russian"" fingerprints all over the documents.** &amp;nbsp; UPDATE (5/27): The owner of g-2.space suggests it was not Warren Flood who personally did poisoning of document with Russian metadata, but a far more sinister agent of DNC using Word applications registered to him, possibly for the express purpose of creating rationale for unmasking: URL **Guccifer 2.0 is none other than a botched DNC creation to create a false flag for Russia.** ## Impact of Guccifer 2.0 being a DNC creation The ""Russian influenced the US election"" campaign all started from the DNC leak. &amp;nbsp; Allegations of Russian influence was built on a completely fabricated foundation of lies. &amp;nbsp; In hindsight, we now know that Obama administration unmasking of US campaign officials on the pretext of ""Russian interference"" started in&amp;nbsp;[June 2016](URL same date as when Guccifer 2.0 began. The implications that the unmasking all was predicated on a DNC psy-ops is staggering. ## Who cares why the DNC did it? **Because it proves that ""Russian interference"" started as a total DNC fabrication that persists to today**. The whole Russian campaign started _before_ Trump made his infamous joke about Russians getting Hillarys emails. &amp;nbsp; Illegal unmasking of Trump campaign officials over Russian interference began June 2016. Was this predicated on Russian interference with the DNC hacks? If so, this means that the leaks not only implicate DNC and plague President Trump himself, but **also implicates Obama administration officials and all the involved intelligence agencies.** &amp;nbsp; ## Why did DNC leak their own documents? Its right in [Guccifer 2.0s blog](URL Pertinent quote: ""The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to Wikileaks. They will publish them soon."" The **DNC knew they were having their documents leaked to Wikileaks**, and wanted to make sure a Russian hacker took credit for the leaks. &amp;nbsp; ## How did the DNC know Wikileaks was going to release the DNC emails? Great question. Its hard to imagine them knowing without assistance from intelligence agencies  and indeed unmasking of campaign officials started in June 2016. &amp;nbsp; This is, of course, highly illegal, and would mean that the Russian disinformation campaign wasnt just a DNC operation, it was also created from collusion with the Obama administration using highly illegal means including violations of the Fourth Amendment. &amp;nbsp; Since Guccifer 2.0 was a botched operation, that might make the continued existence of the real leaker who might draw scrutiny that much more precarious ## What about Crowdstrike report? The metadata I described above can be independently verified by a non-technical person with access to any text editor like vim (which is available on Mac OS terminal command line). It does not require special forsenic analysis to identify. There are only two explanations: staggering incompetence, or DNC collusion. &amp;nbsp; I cannot say if Crowdstrike is competent, but I can say that their [co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council](URL a think tank whose policies could be termed as anti-protectionist. &amp;nbsp; ## Who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks? In short, all circumstantial evidence points to Seth Rich. &amp;nbsp; Seth Rich was killed on July 10, after the Guccifer drops and before the Wikileaks release. Wikileaks offered a [20,000 reward for information on Seth Rich](URL death. &amp;nbsp; Craig Murray, a British national connected with Wikileaks, [claims a disgusted Democrat insider was the leaker](URL and he personally flew overseas to meet one of those connected. &amp;nbsp; ## Was Seth Rich murdered by the DNC? We are getting in speculative territory here. The circumstances of his death are suspicious  there had never been a homicide prior or after in his area. The assailants did not steal any of his valuables. Furthermore, Seth was on the [phone with his girlfriend](URL at the time of his death and is allegedly to have ended the conversation with ""I have to go,"" which is an unusually calm thing to say at a gunpoint robbery. &amp;nbsp; Conspiracy theorists assume Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC to ""set an example."" &amp;nbsp; Personally, I think that as long as Seth Rich existed, he could have spoken up as the leaker at any moment and drawn scrutiny to Guccifer 2.0 being a DNC operation. To our knowledge, the unmasking of Trump and related officials started in June 2016 using the DNC hacks as a pretext. **Seth Richs continued existence could have lead to the fall of the White House and intelligence agencies.** &amp;nbsp; Is that motive enough for a political hit? You tell me. &amp;nbsp; ## News sources say that the ""documents contain DNC metadata"" is disproven. In addition to hosting them on the official Wordpress website, DNC documents were sent directly by Guccifer 2.0 to media outlets such as The Hill (despite Guccifer 2.0 himself claiming hatred of these very same media outlets accusing him of being Russian). &amp;nbsp; What Guccifer 2.0 sent was not always the same as what was on the official Guccifer 2.0 website. My speculation is that Guccifer 2.0 revised the documents to remove the metadata, and sent those corrected documents to media outlets. He could not do the same on his Wordpress site for without drawing intense scrutiny, so the botched documents remained. &amp;nbsp; Bottom line: **it is unimpeachable that watermarked Russian metadata in Guccifers first document drop are associated with a DNC tech worker named Warren Flood who otherwise has nothing to do with the DNC emails**. Any media outlet reporting otherwise are probably either working from their own ""corrected"" copy from Guccifer or spinning hard or both. &amp;nbsp; ## Did Warren Flood himself poison the docs? (Update 5/26) The author of URL , who has done far more extensive metadata analysis, believes Warren Flood is innocent. See URL for his speculation; the documents correlate to strange foreign visitors occurring in Joe Biden's office, where Warren Flood worked in the past. Come to think of it, these foreign visitors, as well as those shady foreign IT contractors with unprecedented top secret clearance, could technically constitute the ""foreign national"" requirements for unmasking... ## What about Robbin Young? (Update 5/26) /u/Holmgeir gives an excellent explanation for why Guccifer 2.0 was motivated to talk with Robbin Young [here](URL . ## What about the RNC strategist who got voting model data from Guccifer 2.0? (Update 5/26) Consider the following puzzle pieces: &amp;nbsp; * [Democrats are so cagey about IT workers that GOP members fear blackmail](URL * [Unmasked data was shared with specified third parties](URL * [Thousands of people were unmasked in 2016](URL &amp;nbsp; Put them all together, and you see that by communicating with ""the foreign national"" Guccifer 2.0, the RNC strategist exposed himself and the entire campaign to being unmasked and having all their data, emails, polls, etc monitored. Maybe worth sacrificing primary turnout models for, no? ## Isn't it a stretch to say the IC helped out the DNC? (Update 5/28) When I originally wrote this post, I wrote it for a conservative audience who already knew the necessary context. Now that it's gained traction, people are confused over why the IC was so casually brought in; isn't that a serious allegation? &amp;nbsp; In 2016, NSA granted 1,934 requests in 2016 to unmask US persons for surveillance, compared to 654 in 2015. [Source](URL Political and Congressional targets made up some of this [massive increase in unmasking](URL Consumers of this unmasked data included Obama national security advisor [Susan Rice](URL and Obama CIA director [John Brennan](URL who is notorious for being extremely political. &amp;nbsp; On top of it all, NSA spy data was allowed to be searched by [third parties](URL that had no right to access it, including ""private entities."" ## How is your theory disproven? (Update 5/28) That's easy. Guccifer 2.0 claims to be the Wikileaks source. So, show the Warren Flood authorship or involvement in the Wikileaks dumps. &amp;nbsp; Until then, either *Guccifer 2.0 is lying about being the Wikileaks source* or *Guccifer 2.0 is an insider who doctored data using an application registered to Warren Flood.* You can't have it both ways. ## Who is Guccifer 2.0? (Update 5/28) Guccifer 2.0 was almost certainly a team effort, but we can make some inferences. Putting all assertion in the posts together, Guccifer 2.0 may have involved a very powerful technological figure who had continuing access to both sensitive DNC data and unmasked IC data, *and* is likely a foreign national. &amp;nbsp; We also now know that at least [one federal contractor](URL had access to NSA spy data. &amp;nbsp; Just to be clear, there are several possibilities. But I'd like to call attention to the most convenient person who fits the bill: **Imran Awan**. &amp;nbsp; Imran Awan, of Pakistani national origin, and four of his family members worked exclusively for the Democrats as IT, [collecting 5 million since 2009](URL He is implicated in data theft of [Congressional members](URL but attentions to raise awareness have gone so ignored by Democrats, and their defenses of them go so deep, that it was speculated Democrats were being blackmailed by them. &amp;nbsp; Awan was the IT person for [Debbie Wasserman Schultz](URL also chair of DNC as of June 2016 who resigned shortly after the Wikileaks release showed collusion to prevent Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee. ## Appendix  Technical details Microsoft Word 2007 format specification: [URL Much more detailed analysis of the Warren Flood documents -[URL (Spezzes are for formatting/proofreading) Spez: Corrected   to say Felix Edmundovich.

172,cybersecurity,The_Donald,Awan Brothers,23,6dbjzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/6dbjzd/awan_brothers/,2017-05-26 04:36:54,"The Awan Brothers 3 Awan brothers are named by Webb : Imran, Jamal and Abid. (A 4th brother and wife of one of the Awan's are also believed to be involved). Originally installed in congressional positions by Greg Meeks who is widely regarded as the most corrupt member of congress. I will preface this discussion by stating you will find some variation in the numbers cited. I believe that is because I quoted from stories as the case was developing. The Daily Caller was the primary source for most of the news on the net. I tried to be as accurate as possible with the facts quoting the sources I found. I am posting this because I want answers, it is not a definitive work. I do, however, believe the breach is every bit as consequential as the hillary email server and the CIA Wikileak. Why isnt the MSM interested in the Awan Brothers: the three IT specialists fired for rooting through House Democrats sensitive files? Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story? I know a bunch of shills will tear me up screaming, ""ya got no proof,"" but indulge me in a conspiracy theory. I think the greatest disservice the MSM had managed to perpetuate is the fallacy that other than the obvious connection of all these people there is otherwise no connection between these events. Let's assume for the moment that the items described here are patterns of political belief and criminal activity. They aren't individual acts, but on going criminal conspiracies. Let's not look at this as an isolated event. While I'm detailing the actions of the Awan brothers. I believe, but can not prove, those action may have been perpetuated in concert with other individuals at work in the under belly of the government. It's almost as if disparate groups come in contact occasionally when their objectives overlap. As I stated, I have no proof of this, but it stands to reason the flood of cyber attacks and leaks may have overlapped through the individuals linked in the different events. For example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz was an integral player in the DNC Hacks and also introduced the Awan brothers to Congress. Is there a connection? Maybe, maybe not. It is not that far fetched, this has happened before, see the Silverman group. Silverman associated with the CPUSA and knew Jarretts father, Dr. James Bowman and through three degrees of separation used by the NSA is directly connected to Valerie Jerrett. If it is good enough for the IC to open an inquiry why can't we indulge in some similar speculation.  The First anomalous fact is the Media. Why have they largely ignored the issue. Before you cyber trolls jump on me, I would like you to consider two facts. Congress deals with very sensitive and classified material all the time. The Awan brothers could never have had a secret clearance for any other group than Congress. There is no news story there?  The Second error is the ""smoking gun."" The evidence is always covered up with a coincidence, a cover story if you will. While I believe the politicos in D.C. are pampered rubes, they do have a good support staff, and some have been trained to support clandestine operations. The rest have been hammered with political optics for the entirety of their career in D.C.. They are all trained to control optics and the dissemination of the truth.  The Third fallacy is the ""bad guy."" Why does everyone think an on going criminal conspiracy can be distilled down to a single criminal committing a crime rather than a pattern of criminal behavior with one or more groups profiting off the criminal activities. It is best to think of their actions like organized crime and should be prosecuted like a RICO case. An on going criminal enterprise by an organized group or groups of conspirators. The Media Why hasn't the media made this the top news story to at least go along with the Russian hack. Let's face it, the media doesn't care about the damage to the country, they only care about their partisan agenda. If they didn't they would cover stories damaging to the DNC. With a $600,000,000 CIA contract you would think the Washington Post could afford an investigative journalist or two. Perhaps CNN will take up an interest as this rabbit hole runs deep and wide. Don't hold your breath. Snowflakes and ""journalists"" can call Trump a fascist, but there is nothing connecting an enormous breach of the United States Security Apparatus by as many as 80 Democrat members of Congress (past and present). We rail on about the Russians and Trump without specific allegations backed up with evidence, but the media avoids providing nightly updates about these 5 spies that have compromised congress. The answer is simple, the Awan Brothers are Muslim and the ""victims""/dupes are Dems. Dupes who in fact abused their position of responsibility to end up being compromised by their own ""trusted"" staff. Several of the Congressmen involved in the breach have gone so far as to blame the allegations on Islamophobia. Meeks said he was hesitant to believe the accusations against Alvi, Imran Awan and the three other staffers, saying their background as Muslim Americans, some with ties to Pakistan, could make them easy targets for false charges. This story damages the narrative that Muslims are benevolent members of the government and Dems care about the country. It really shows the depth of the progressive aims to ""fundamentally transforming the United States of America. This is where the conspiracy theory comes in. Give me a little latitude to connect the dots, and let's see where this trail goes... An Alleged Muslim Spy Ring - Is This Why Rex Tillerson Cleaned House? The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet. Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood fifth column has infiltrated U.S. Government, and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration. The media is 90% Democrat and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists? One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder  why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all? Do Carlos Slim and Jeff Bezos, one might ask, really believe they cant sell papers with such a story to tell? The Smoking Gun EXCLUSIVE: House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs Committee Members Compromised By Rogue IT Staff Fox News is told the employees made unauthorized access to the House computer system. Further, there were instances where House information was discovered in an external cloud server. The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server. That violates House rules and it puts the House at risk, a source familiar with the investigation said. It is unclear whether the access issues exposed the Houses networks to potential hackers or spying efforts by unfriendly nations or terrorist groups, at a time when Washington is on high alert for such cyber-activity. Actually the last statement has been refuted. It has been alleged that Imran Awan had achieved a privilege escalation through Social Engineering. Essentially Imran through the political clout of the Congressional leaders he worked for managed to convinced the Capitol Hill IT staff to escalate the Awans to super user privileges to work on the ""Congressional Machines"" in violation of accepted practices on the network. One device in particular was the Wasserman iPad compromised in the DNC Leak. It has been also alleged they may have had Podesta's password. Since the Dems approved the privilege escalation it is now forensically difficult to determine if the Russians leaked the emails or the ""enormously trustworthy and drunken"" Awan brothers sold access to the DNC servers. House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received Imran Awan bullied central IT to bend the rules for him so there wouldnt be a paper trail about the unusually high permissions he was requesting. And their actions were not logged, so members have no way of knowing what information they may have taken, the central IT employee said. After obtaining access to the Capitol server system, the Awan brothers could control all aspects of a congressman system. They sold and configured the hardware setting permissions and remote access to maintain the devices remotely. Essentially the keys to the kingdom. Through congressional requests they managed to completely compromise the network. They could read email, transfer files, install applications (i.e. key loggers). The latter reports that the systems and network were completely compromised. Beyond that, Imran had bypassed IT key loggers and reporting systems by gaining remote access directly to congressional computers. House Hacking Suspects Could Read Every Email Dozens Of Congressmen Sent And Received The central IT staffer said any suggestion that the brothers access didnt span the full gamut of congressional intrigue was silly because they were the ones giving out permissions. The problem is that once they bypassed internal security there was no logging of their actions. House authorities set their sights on the possibility that a remote server had been used to transfer files off of Congressional members computers. The investigation revealed that Imran had been stealing money, equipment, and over charging for services. In total for almost 10 years and almost 80 Democrat members of Congress were compromised. This is where things go hinkey. Rather than turning the case over to the FBI the case is turned over to U.S.C. Police. They are investigating the theft, not the data breach. Let's state that again... The USCP are investigation the theft of Equipment not the Loss Of Congressional Data. Congressional IT Staff Under Investigation In Alleged Procurement Scam At the request of Members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff, Malecki said in a statement. ""No Members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. It should be noted that, administratively, House staff were asked to update their security settings as a best practice. We have no further comment on the ongoing investigation at this time."" The Bad Guy Two of the brothers, Imran and Jamal, have been linked to an emerging security breach The Awan brothers managed to get access to the Dems committee computers by just asking for the passwords. In addition the Awan brothers sold the congress outrageously priced equipment and broke into members of Congress' offices to steal equipment and or data. House staffers under criminal investigation for alleged equipment theft Five House employees are under criminal investigation amid allegations that they stole equipment from more than 20 member offices and accessed House IT systems without lawmakers' knowledge. More than 20 members were victimized by the alleged procurement scam and chiefs of staff for the lawmakers were briefed on the matter Thursday. The former staffer said Jamal was always there, but Imran would only work odd hours. And who is investigating this fiasco? Where is the FBI and why have they left it to the DC police? Is it a ""limited hangout"" they hope to bury by the promoting the administration's ties to Boris and Natasha? D.C. Metro police have been brought into the investigation rather than the F.B.I at the request of the Congressional members involved with the Awan Brothers. A source in the briefing said the Sergeant-at-Arms confirmed the U.S. Capitol Police is conducting an active criminal investigation but said no arrests have been made. The source said the FBI is not involved in the investigation. ""At the request of members of Congress, the United States Capitol Police are investigating the actions of House IT support staff. No members are being investigated. No arrests have been made. Why aren't the FBI involved? I can only speculate, but it would mean that a FBI forensic team would have to comb through all of those congressional computers to determine the extent of the security compromise and data lost. The Dems just didn't seem up for the inconvenience of allowing the FBI investigation to go forward. The Awan Brothers had the keys to the kingdom. Physical security is paramount to cyber security. If a hacker has Physical access to a machine they own it. It is the simplest hack to conduct. The Anwar Bros had Debbie Wasserman Schultz's machine, along with Schultz, at least 80 other Dems also hired the Awan Brothers to provide IT support at significantly higher rates than normal IT support. Jamal, who public records suggest is only 22 years old and first began working in the House when he was 20, was paid nearly $160,000 a year, or three times the average House IT staff salary, according to InsideGov, which tracks congressional salaries. Abid was paid $161,000 and Imran $165,000. Democrats evidently paid the Awan brothers over $4 MILLION dollars. Despite the fact that these individuals, reportedly heavily in debt, would have failed security clearances they were able to receive top salary from Dems including members of the intelligence panel and members of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs were among the dozens of members who employed the suspects on a shared basis. The two committees deal with many of the nations most sensitive issues, information and documents, including those related to the war on terrorism. Where's The Evidence? Hillary's Henchmen and the Awan Brothers Hack vs. MSM and Pelosi's Russia, Russia, Russia Meme Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who was shamed for the Democratic National Committee conspiracy against Bernie Sanders, recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and Representative Jackie Speier asked for their TOP SECRET CLEARANCE. Whatever Happened with the Awan Brothers? frontpagemag | Last year, eight members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence issued a demand that their staffers be granted access to top secret classified information. The signatories to the letter were Andre Carson, Luis Guiterez, Jim Himes, Terri Sewell, Jackie Speier, Mike Quigley, Eric Swalwell and Patrick Murphy. All the signatories were Democrats. Some had a history of attempting to undermine national security. Beyond the debt, the brothers seemed to have, they had convictions for felony traffic offenses including DUI. Any one of these issues are enough to prevent or revoke a security clearance for normal folks. I guess things just work differently on Capitol Hill. The American military or college grads are denied clearances due similar issues in their record, but not these Pakistani brothers. Any one of these offenses would have caused me to fail my FBI background check at work, but congress can admit anybody. Do you see a problem here? Valerie Jarrett and Huma Abedin are perfect examples of the double standard in the government / Congress. Staffers of any background history can get clearances, but Dems seem to be able to prevent Trump's staff from getting clearance. What is going on here? URL Multiple small businesses and individuals went unpaid as a result of the 2012 bankruptcy. Abid also had an unpaid line of credit of $10,000 with the congressional credit union at the time of bankruptcy. Abids record includes numerous driving- and alcohol-related legal problems, including driving with a suspended or revoked license, court records show. He was found guilty of drunk driving a month before he started at the House, and was arrested for public intoxication a month after his first day. with possibly opposing goals. A felon normally commits the felony tens of times, maybe hundreds of times before they get caught. How many times does a Coke head commit a felony buying coke before they get caught? If they ever get caught, how many years do they get away with the crimes before they draw the attention of the authorities. The FBI, Congress, whatever never find the full scope of criminal activity. They may just get enough evidence to convict of a crime, but they never convict for all the crimes committed. What is really becoming obvious is the Democrats have irresponsibly opened our congressional security oversight to Middle Eastern Factions. These 5 are just one group that were exposed. Hillary had Huma, Obama had Vallery. A sharia practicing terrorist that believes in female circumcision leading a woman's March to equality in the 21st century. There are so many examples that one has to be purposefully obtuse to ignore the contradictions. While the nay sayers claim you can not connect the dots it is obvious that the dots were there for all to see and could have been connected. I would say that the deviation from standard security practices was intentional, but Podesta's password was password123 or some such nonsense. Who knows, our leaders may really be that incompetent. They haven't even made it to the minimum expectations to be employed in corporate America. I really don't know what to make of two very different groups with nothing but vaguely similar beliefs in Marxist ideals working together. Many of the thoughts I have on the subject are almost too extreme to believe, but the evidence is almost unavoidable. None of it makes sense unless someone is lying about their objectives.

DNC announces they've been hacked. 1. The day after, a hacker calling himself Guccifer 2.0 claims to have taken credit for the hack and announces he will be giving his documents to Wikileaks.&amp;nbsp;Guccifer 2.0 vehemently denies being Russian, a faade he keeps up throughout his activity. 1. Bolstered by Crowdstrike's report and the metadata in Guccifer 2.0's documents, media outlets immediately start screaming that Guccifer 2.0 must be Russian agents. 1. Finally, Wikileaks releases the DNC documents a month after Guccifer 2.0 did. &amp;nbsp; This post unmasks Guccifer 2.0's identity as none other than the DNC. &amp;nbsp; ## What did Guccifer 2.0 do? Guccifer 2.0 hosted a Wordpress site where the DNC documents could be publicly downloaded. June 15th was the date of the first Guccifer 2.0 leak; further leaks would continue thereafter. I focus only on the first leak, as they contain the metadata which are essential to proving it was a DNC operation.&amp;nbsp; ## What were in the leaked Guccifer documents?&amp;nbsp; Guccifer 2.0 leaked a total of 10 Office documents from the DNC in the first batch (many more would come, but none contain the same ""mistakes"" as the ones I shall detail). &amp;nbsp; All Microsoft Office documents have&amp;nbsp;_metadata_&amp;nbsp;entries which contain attributes about the document itself such as the user that created them, the user that modified them, and so on. This metadata is usually invisible to viewers but can be viewed with a raw text editor like Notepad, or on Mac OS, vim. &amp;nbsp; It would be&amp;nbsp;unusual for a leaker to modify the metadata, but Guccifer 2.0 did, claiming that it was his ""watermark."" &amp;nbsp; In Office, the metadata includes the owner of the Office application&amp;nbsp;**who**&amp;nbsp;**created the file**&amp;nbsp;and the owner of the Office application&amp;nbsp;**who modified the file**. I present a list of the document names having metadata values for original author &amp; modified author: &amp;nbsp; |**Document name**|**Original author**|**Modified author**| |:--|:--|:--| |1.doc|Warren Flood| | |2.doc|Warren Flood| | |3.doc|Warren Flood| | |4.doc|Blake|&amp;nbsp;| |5.doc|jbs836| | &amp;nbsp;  , or Felix Edmundovich in the English alphabet, refers to Felix Dzerzhinsky, an early Soviet statesman and KGB figure who died in 1926. (It's been pointed out in other comments that an actual Russian would never choose "" "" over "" "".) ## So what... Warren Flood, Blake, and jbs836 were the original authors? Short answer: No. Non-technical answer: For one thing, we can cross-reference the actual authors from the Wikileaks dump. 1.doc is in the ""verified"" Wikileaks release as the attachment which can be downloaded [from here](URL which has the original author of ""Lauren Dillon."" So, wait, who is Warren Flood et al? Each of these documents had a creation date of June 15, and were modified by "" "" a few minutes later. &amp;nbsp; In Office 2007 format specification, there is a certain stylesheet template which dictates overall formatting for the document. In three of the documents by Warren Flood, we find the identical metadata. {\s108\ql \li0\ri0\widctlpar\wrapdefault\aspalpha\aspnum\faauto\adjustright\rin0\lin0\itap0\contextualspace \rtlch\fcs1 \af1\afs20\alang1025 \ltrch\fcs0\f1\fs20\lang1049\langfe1049\cgrid\langnp1049\langfenp1049\sbasedon0 \snext108 \slink107 \sqformat \spriority1 \styrsid11758497 No Spacing;} The above line appears across all three of Warren Flood's documents. styrsid11758497 is an unique identifier that is session-associative. The fact that it does not appear in the other documents indicates it's associated with Warren Flood and not  . &amp;nbsp; Why is this important? Well, the \langfe1049 portion is a setting saying that Russian language should be used as the default language for the document. &amp;nbsp; Had   been setting the ""watermark,"" it would be the same across all documents. But instead, distinct watermarks were created for each document creator, suggesting inconsistent application or three different creators applying their own watermark. In other words, document creators set the document properties to use Russian language and created three distinct so-called 'watermarks' in doing so, not ' .' &amp;nbsp; Also, cross-reference to Wikileaks shows that Warren Flood did not author any of the documents. And given that the timestamps are all on June 15th, this is the sequence of events: &amp;nbsp; * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood opens a DNC document, copies it, and pastes it as a new document to his computer. * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood sets the theme language to Russian in some way (this process is different for all authors). * A worker using a computer registered to Warren Flood modifies the document's author to  . * The modified document is then uploaded to the Guccifer website and publicly published a short time thereafter. ## Who is Warren Flood? Warren Flood is a high-ranking technology official for Democratic operatives, having worked for Obama for America, DNC, and Joe Biden.&amp;nbsp; It's a unique name. &amp;nbsp; His name does not appear in any of the Wikileaks emails, meaning that he appears to be a third party as far as the DNC email leaks are concerned. &amp;nbsp; Other than his (professional Internet) profile, he is a virtual social media ghost, never having made any Tweets nor any evidence of real social media activity. &amp;nbsp; The pertinent point is that:&amp;nbsp;**the metadata forensic proof is irrefutable that Warren Flood,&amp;nbsp;**or someone who used a copy of Word registered to Warren Flood**, shoehorned in obvious ""Russian"" fingerprints all over the documents.** &amp;nbsp; UPDATE (5/27): The owner of g-2.space suggests it was not Warren Flood who personally did poisoning of document with Russian metadata, but a far more sinister agent of DNC using Word applications registered to him, possibly for the express purpose of creating rationale for unmasking: URL **Guccifer 2.0 is none other than a botched DNC creation to create a false flag for Russia.** ## Impact of Guccifer 2.0 being a DNC creation The ""Russian influenced the US election"" campaign all started from the DNC leak. &amp;nbsp; Allegations of Russian influence was built on a completely fabricated foundation of lies. &amp;nbsp; In hindsight, we now know that Obama administration unmasking of US campaign officials on the pretext of ""Russian interference"" started in&amp;nbsp;[June 2016](URL same date as when Guccifer 2.0 began. The implications that the unmasking all was predicated on a DNC psy-ops is staggering. ## Who cares why the DNC did it? **Because it proves that ""Russian interference"" started as a total DNC fabrication that persists to today**. The whole Russian campaign started _before_ Trump made his infamous joke about Russians getting Hillarys emails. &amp;nbsp; Illegal unmasking of Trump campaign officials over Russian interference began June 2016. Was this predicated on Russian interference with the DNC hacks? If so, this means that the leaks not only implicate DNC and plague President Trump himself, but **also implicates Obama administration officials and all the involved intelligence agencies.** &amp;nbsp; ## Why did DNC leak their own documents? Its right in [Guccifer 2.0s blog](URL Pertinent quote: ""The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails, I gave to Wikileaks. They will publish them soon."" The **DNC knew they were having their documents leaked to Wikileaks**, and wanted to make sure a Russian hacker took credit for the leaks. &amp;nbsp; ## How did the DNC know Wikileaks was going to release the DNC emails? Great question. Its hard to imagine them knowing without assistance from intelligence agencies  and indeed unmasking of campaign officials started in June 2016. &amp;nbsp; This is, of course, highly illegal, and would mean that the Russian disinformation campaign wasnt just a DNC operation, it was also created from collusion with the Obama administration using highly illegal means including violations of the Fourth Amendment. &amp;nbsp; Since Guccifer 2.0 was a botched operation, that might make the continued existence of the real leaker who might draw scrutiny that much more precarious ## What about Crowdstrike report? The metadata I described above can be independently verified by a non-technical person with access to any text editor like vim (which is available on Mac OS terminal command line). It does not require special forsenic analysis to identify. There are only two explanations: staggering incompetence, or DNC collusion. &amp;nbsp; I cannot say if Crowdstrike is competent, but I can say that their [co-founder and CTO, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a senior fellow with the Atlantic Council](URL a think tank whose policies could be termed as anti-protectionist. &amp;nbsp; ## Who leaked the DNC emails to Wikileaks? In short, all circumstantial evidence points to Seth Rich. &amp;nbsp; Seth Rich was killed on July 10, after the Guccifer drops and before the Wikileaks release. Wikileaks offered a [20,000 reward for information on Seth Rich](URL death. &amp;nbsp; Craig Murray, a British national connected with Wikileaks, [claims a disgusted Democrat insider was the leaker](URL and he personally flew overseas to meet one of those connected. &amp;nbsp; ## Was Seth Rich murdered by the DNC? We are getting in speculative territory here. The circumstances of his death are suspicious  there had never been a homicide prior or after in his area. The assailants did not steal any of his valuables. Furthermore, Seth was on the [phone with his girlfriend](URL at the time of his death and is allegedly to have ended the conversation with ""I have to go,"" which is an unusually calm thing to say at a gunpoint robbery. &amp;nbsp; Conspiracy theorists assume Seth Rich was murdered by the DNC to ""set an example."" &amp;nbsp; Personally, I think that as long as Seth Rich existed, he could have spoken up as the leaker at any moment and drawn scrutiny to Guccifer 2.0 being a DNC operation. To our knowledge, the unmasking of Trump and related officials started in June 2016 using the DNC hacks as a pretext. **Seth Richs continued existence could have lead to the fall of the White House and intelligence agencies.** &amp;nbsp; Is that motive enough for a political hit? You tell me. &amp;nbsp; ## News sources say that the ""documents contain DNC metadata"" is disproven. In addition to hosting them on the official Wordpress website, DNC documents were sent directly by Guccifer 2.0 to media outlets such as The Hill (despite Guccifer 2.0 himself claiming hatred of these very same media outlets accusing him of being Russian). &amp;nbsp; What Guccifer 2.0 sent was not always the same as what was on the official Guccifer 2.0 website. My speculation is that Guccifer 2.0 revised the documents to remove the metadata, and sent those corrected documents to media outlets. He could not do the same on his Wordpress site for without drawing intense scrutiny, so the botched documents remained. &amp;nbsp; Bottom line: **it is unimpeachable that watermarked Russian metadata in Guccifers first document drop are associated with a DNC tech worker named Warren Flood who otherwise has nothing to do with the DNC emails**. Any media outlet reporting otherwise are probably either working from their own ""corrected"" copy from Guccifer or spinning hard or both. &amp;nbsp; ## Did Warren Flood himself poison the docs? The author of URL , who has done far more extensive metadata analysis, believes Warren Flood is innocent. See URL for his speculation; the documents correlate to strange foreign visitors occurring in Joe Biden's office, where Warren Flood worked in the past. Come to think of it, these foreign visitors, as well as those shady foreign IT contractors with unprecedented top secret clearance, could technically constitute the ""foreign national"" requirements for unmasking... ## What about Robbin Young? /u/Holmgeir gives an excellent explanation for why Guccifer 2.0 was motivated to talk with Robbin Young [here](URL . ## What about the RNC strategist who got voting model data from Guccifer 2.0? Consider the following puzzle pieces: &amp;nbsp; * [Democrats are so cagey about IT workers that GOP members fear blackmail](URL * [Unmasked data was shared with specified third parties](URL * [Thousands of people were unmasked in 2016](URL &amp;nbsp; Put them all together, and you see that by communicating with ""the foreign national"" Guccifer 2.0, the RNC strategist exposed himself and the entire campaign to being unmasked and having all their data, emails, polls, etc monitored. Maybe worth sacrificing primary turnout models for, no? ## Isn't it a stretch to say the IC helped out the DNC? When I originally wrote this post, I wrote it for a conservative audience who already knew the necessary context. Now that it's gained traction, people are confused over why the IC was so casually brought in; isn't that a serious allegation? &amp;nbsp; In 2016, NSA granted 1,934 requests in 2016 to unmask US persons for surveillance, compared to 654 in 2015. [Source](URL Political and Congressional targets made up some of this [massive increase in unmasking](URL Consumers of this unmasked data included Obama national security advisor [Susan Rice](URL and Obama CIA director [John Brennan](URL who is notorious for being extremely political. &amp;nbsp; On top of it all, NSA spy data was allowed to be searched by [third parties](URL that had no right to access it, including ""private entities."" ## How is your theory disproven? That's easy. Guccifer 2.0 claims to be the Wikileaks source. So, show the Warren Flood authorship or involvement in the Wikileaks dumps. &amp;nbsp; Until then, either *Guccifer 2.0 is lying about being the Wikileaks source* or *Guccifer 2.0 is an insider who doctored data using an application registered to Warren Flood.* You can't have it both ways. ## Who is Guccifer 2.0? Guccifer 2.0 was almost certainly a team effort, but we can make some inferences. Putting all assertion in the posts together, Guccifer 2.0 may have involved a very powerful technological figure who had continuing access to both sensitive DNC data and unmasked IC data, *and* is likely a foreign national. &amp;nbsp; We also now know that at least [one federal contractor](URL had access to NSA spy data. &amp;nbsp; Just to be clear, there are several possibilities. But I'd like to call attention to the most convenient person who fits the bill: **Imran Awan**. &amp;nbsp; Imran Awan, of Pakistani national origin, and four of his family members worked exclusively for the Democrats as IT, [collecting 5 million since 2009](URL He is implicated in data theft of [Congressional members](URL but attentions to raise awareness have gone so ignored by Democrats, and their defenses of them go so deep, that it was speculated Democrats were being blackmailed by them. &amp;nbsp; Awan was the IT person for [Debbie Wasserman Schultz](URL also chair of DNC as of June 2016 who resigned shortly after the Wikileaks release showed collusion to prevent Bernie Sanders from becoming the nominee. ## Appendix  Technical details Microsoft Word 2007 format specification: [URL Much more detailed analysis of the Warren Flood documents -[URL "

The mainstream media seemed far more interested in obfuscating the details regarding the Tillerson terminations than they were in covering what could be one of the most dangerous intelligence leaks in years, of which there has been but a peep out of any major news outlet. Captain Joseph R. John (Navy-Ret.) has stated that he believes the Muslim Brotherhood fifth column has infiltrated U.S. Government, and if he is correct, the Awan brothers could very well be a part of this infiltration. The media is 90% Democrat and I would argue that in recent years the mainline Dems have gone hard left, almost Marxist. They have an almost suicidal pact with Islamists. Where does this scandal connect with Middle Eastern Islamists? One might well look at the set of circumstances laid out above and see in it a scandal that would make Watergate look like a petty break-in. One might then scratch his or her head and wonder  why on earth would the New York Times or the Washington Post, which incidentally just hired John Podesta (speaking of horrendous cybersecurity!) as a columnist, have virtually no interest in the Awans at all?

Before I get too far into this information I want to give credit to [Luke Rosiak](URL who has written a great series of pieces for the Daily Caller, and [George Webb](URL who has done a great [YouTube](URL series. Beyond the normal video usually posted George Webb asks his viewers to tweet and email representatives and media figures. If they get a barrage of mail they can't ignore the information. He has already got information read in to the congressional record and coverage from media personalities. Now before ya'll scream""Ya gots no proof,"" I will direct you to my [previous post](URL The information in that post comes from credible sources and is cited. While I will continue to cite my information there are some spots where I will be making logical leaps that as of yet I cannot prove. If you see flaws in the logic please post and I will address the issues. Louie Gohmert read a statement in to the congressional record. [Congressional Testimony about violations of cyber security and procurement scam. An abbreviated employment history of the Awan brothers](URL The only voices giving this story any attention are the keyboard warriors in reddit and videos like the ones George Webb has done. This story looks like it is bigger than the clinton server. I made some assumptions in this piece from the information available, but the MSM is doing their best to kill this story. u/911bodysnatchers322 was also picked up by investmentwatchblog.com with their piece [Who are the Awan IT Staff that hacked House Intelligence Computers? And Why Wont the Media cover this Evidence-based Story?](URL #So let's get in to the basics of the case.  The size and scope of the breach has various numbers in the reporting. It appears that the case is still expanding. This is why quoted text may have conflicting numbers. Earlier articles were still revealing the scope of the breach.  The numbers vary in the reporting but four Pakistani Brothers, Imran Awan, Abid Awan and Jamal Moiz Awan, and 2 wives get an IT job in Congress. Their has been some mention of a possible unrelated party involved as well. &gt;Additionally, it was revealed that these employees were paid more than three times the salary of a normal IT worker, grossing upwards of $5 million dollars combined during their tenure as IT professionals. While the average government IT professional earns about $55,000 per year, Imran Awan was being paid $165,130, Abid Awan grossed $164,980 per annum, and Jamal Awan $157,577 according to government records. &gt;Soon after Imran began working for members of Congress, Imrans and Abids wives  Hina Alvi and Natalia Sova  also began receiving [congressional paychecks](URL The DCNF found. Imrans employers included two members of the intelligence committee, Indiana Democrat Rep. Andre Carson and California Democrat Rep. Jackie Speier.  From 2004/2005 Imran and his brothers work their way in to Capitol Hill staffer jobs to an unspecified number of Congressmen. The reporting ranges from 30 to 80 depending on the article cited. It appears that about 30 representatives added the Awan brothers to their payroll, but they may have done associated and work for about 80 representatives. &gt;Imran Awan has a longtime relationship with some members of Congress, including working for Meeks and Becerra starting in 2004 and joining Wasserman Schultz's office in 2005. The IT staffer position expanded to include more than 30 representatives, including work under congressional members who were members of top secret level congressional committees (DHS, Foreign affairs, Select intelligence committee). &gt;Although personal office computers are not supposed to be used for Intelligence Committee business or classified material, [accessing these computers](URL is a high priority for foreign intelligence services because of the information they could glean about the committees work from unclassified emails. Their is contested information that the Awan brothers did get access to sensitive and classified information. While the emails and internal correspondence would be considered sensitive, but I have yet to confirm classified information was compromised, however a lot of circumstantial evidence prevent me from ruling out the possibility. The brothers are suspected of serious violations including accessing members computer networks without their knowledge and stealing equipment from Congress, over billing congress for work and parts, transferring data to a remote server, and bypassing normal security protocols for IT staff. Their Democrat benefactors allowed the breech of policy for the sake of convenience.  The Awans operated an external server, which is against all protocols concerning secured government information. &gt;Further, there were instances where [House information was discovered in an external cloud server](URL The contractors in question reportedly were sending and storing House-related information in that off-site server.  The Awans had special access to the White House and for Visas.  Multiple Democratic lawmakers have yet to cut ties with House staffers under criminal investigation for wide-ranging equipment and data theft. ``Imran Awan, a longtime House staffer who worked for more than two dozen Democrats since 2004, is still employed by Rep. Debbie Wasserman (As of March 5, 2017) In my first [article](URL I glossed over the kidnapping of the ""stepmother"" not understanding the significance of the event. When I read the [Fairfax County Police report](URL it just didn't grab my attention. One fact I missed was the use of electronic surveillance to control the movements and actions of the stepmother. I also failed to understand the Awan brothers were trying to gain access to funds in Pakistan. &gt;Congressional staffers allegedly held their stepmother in captivity with violent threats in a plan to use her to access money stashed away in the Middle East. The staffers are suspected of using their positions to enrich themselves.  &gt;They kept their stepmother in sort of illegal captivity from October 16, 2016 to February 2, the relative said, telling her they were in charge of her life and said she was not allowed to speak to anyone. The fact that she did not speak English made it easy for them to take advantage of her.  &gt;The brothers bugged her house with hidden listening devices and told her her movements were under constant surveillance and conversations within the house and over the telephone were being listened to. They would repeat what she had told people to prove that they were really listening.  &gt;But as soon as Shah passed away, they came into the house and whatever documents were there they stole, a couple laptops which were their fathers property, and left for Pakistan. ###And left for Pakistan... ###This article proves a number of things that should be explored. ###The first would be the use of surveillance equipment on the stepmother. Yes, I will concede that they could have bought the equipment to watch their stepmother, but I believe that is unlikely. The skills to run a surveillance operation are beyond most IT techs. It's not that they couldn't figure it out, they just wouldn't have the equipment. While the price is dropping, running an effective bugging operation is expensive and time consuming. Let's consider for they moment the brothers had the equipment for other jobs and repurposed the equipment for their surveillance of the stepmother. This brings us to the first logical leap... How many of you have used an in-line key logger? It's a simple, inexpensive device that can't be detected by antivirus software. It operates outside of the OS plugged into the USB port then the keyboard is plugged into the logger. The only real problem is obtaining access to deploy and recover the device. This brings us to the break ins. Why did the Awan brothers break in to 20+ Congressional offices when they already had full admin and remote access to the computers. It has already been proven they could access/edit/delete all the Congressmen's email, files, everything. It is even possible to remotely format a system. They could even transfer data to a remote off site server. There was no reason to break in to the offices to recover data, so what were they after? I believe it was to recover something other than data. It only stands to reason they had to recover surveillance equipment and or Spyware installed in the offices and systems. They were running a bugging operation on congress and had to retrieve the equipment before they lost access to it. #The second is why did they run? Here is the second logical leap. They began controlling the movement of their stepmother on the 16th of October, 2016. No one at least in the Democrat party even entertained the possibility hillary would not be the next president. Even the pro Trump supporters had to admit he was a long shot until 9pm on election night. Almost everybody believed hillary would win and the bodies would stay buried forever. Imran was familiar with the clintons and it has been reported Imran was quite friendly with bill clinton. He was about to dramatically expand his sphere of influence. The Awan brothers had no obvious reason for consolidating their assets and running to Pakistan. They began their consolidation of assets some time before October 16th. This implies planning and fore thought. They knew something was coming. What could have been lucrative enough or dangerous enough to have caused the need to pack up shop and get out of town Was it the health of their father that caused the need to control the family assets? They were clearly attempting to get control of the father's, Muhammad Shah, assets and power of attorney here and later in Pakistan to ""inherit"" the family assets, but that would not have been cause to run. They could have acquired the assets and remained in the United States. It has already been shown they had enough clout to get past any problems the stepmother could have caused. That would not have required a break in to 20 congressional offices and a complete exodus of the United States. In view of the events we know that was an exaggerated response to events, or something else had to change. Was it the DNC hack? The wikileaks of email systems they protected? Was it the proposed changes to the security clearance for staffers that made them run? Could it have been the new policy of FBI background checks for staffers and the request for a Top Secret/Compartmentalized information request for investigation of staffers attached to the Congressional Intelligence Committee. Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz and Rep. Jackie Speier recommended the Awan Brothers for their positions and asked for their [TOP SECRET (TS/SCI) CLEARANCE](URL This .pdf is a request for a budget addition of $125,000 to conduct background investigations for the highest level of top secret/compartmentalized information (TS/SCI) clearance for Intelligence committee staffers. This is speculation, but the Awan brothers were getting the brass ring. They had access to congressional data that would only increase with the clearance. This brings in an angle of the story I had found little published information on Nanoset Technologies, but what has been reported in r/TruthLeaks is the beginning of something solid on the Awan brothers web of business interests. ###Nanoset Technologies &gt;Nanoset Technologies were a government contractor that sells IT equipment to the government, but the Awans were officers in that company while they were staff, which is a conflict-of-interest {{ But it's also a way to get equipment with backdoors into the Congress }}  &gt;There is a well-known Bangladeshi doctor at the VA in Baltimore, MD [name redacted]. She was living with the Awans, and was doing business with the Awans--an odd mix of IT and Medicine. She became a CEO of Nanoset Technology while she was an MD at the VA, and the business listed is just a condo. How much biz did they do with the US Government? This would have been very lucrative for their business and open a whole new horizon of contacts and government pork they could bid on, why would the run? What would the investigation turn up? I have to admit I don't know the answer here, but it doesn't make sense. What I do know is we have not been provided a good reason for why they were planning their escape to Pakistan prior to October 16th, 2016. #The Security Clearance Prior to 2017 IT Staff could get access to Congressional computers systems with a simple FBI background check. Members of Congress could pencil whip this if they vouched for the staffer. [Do Members of Congress Have Security Clearances?](URL House and Senate staff members with a need to access classified information are required to obtain security clearances. The Office of Senate Security and Office of House Security, respectively, have oversight over the security clearance process for congressional staffers, and background investigations are conducted by the FBI. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media is Ignoring](URL &gt;According to the [CIAs Center for the Study of Intelligence](URL There are no written rules, agreed to by both branches, governing what intelligence will be shared with the Hill or how it will be handled. The current system is entirely the product of experience, shaped by the needs and concerns of both branches over the last 20 years.  &gt;The House reportedly only required background investigations of House IT staff in 2016. These investigations were to be applied retroactively to existing House IT staff unless a member signed a waiver attesting to their trustworthiness and judgment. ###Is the FBI investigating this case? No, it was found to be in the Jurisdiction of the D.C. Capitol Police. As had been stated the U.S. Capitol Police are investigating the break ins of the congressional offices. Despite [Paul Ryan's](URL assurances, I wont speak to the nature of their investigation, but theyre getting the kind of technical assistance they need to do that, this is under an active criminal investigation"", How is D.C.

These are people who had direct connections and access to the House, to intelligence information,... This is actually something that could directly affect the national security of the United States, and I have seen very little reporting, and apparently, the Democrats are not that interested. An argument could also be made that the Awan brothers violated [18 U.S. Code  793 - Gathering, transmitting or losing defense information](URL I'm not a lawyer, but it looks more and more like a federal case. If so, then why are D.C. Capitol Police investigating a crime that could have tremendous scope? So while [The FBI Is Building a National Watchlist That Gives Companies Real-Time Updates on Employees](URL for the rest of us, the word of a Congressional Representative who was also grandfathered a clearance just for getting in to the club can also recommend their staff for clearances. I understand elections have consequences, and our representatives need access to make informed legislative decisions, but through a funded campaign literally anyone can get a clearance. Like an enemy intelligence services wouldn't try to run for congress. At least a spy would have a better criminal record that many members of Congress. My point is the staff needs additional scrutiny and changes to staffing policy might need to be addressed. The staff doesn't need to be trusted by the representative, they need to be trusted by the country. In the corporate world, if the staff covers up crimes committed by the CEO they go to jail, but in Washington it seems to be a job requirement. ###Could a Foreign Intelligence Service be Involved? If so, Which One? Is it so hard to believe the very capable ISI could have sent in operatives to infiltrate the Congressional Intelligence committee. After breaking in to 20 congressional offices and leaving the United States under suspicious circumstances, is it absurd to consider a foreign intelligence agency might be attempting to compromise the House Intelligence Committee. We're building a circumstantial case but there is no meat on it. Where is the connection to the ISI, the Muslim Brotherhood, the Iranians? Where is the connection to any extremists? ###The following are informed guessing. I haven't found direct evidence to support this speculation, but have seen [circumstantial evidence](URL that points strongly towards ties to a larger group. I'm including this section primarily to elicit responses from you, the reader. I'm looking for direction and leads for the next article. Help me out and tell me what you think. [Another Major Democratic Email Scandal the News Media Is Ignoring](URL &gt;Were these IT staffers part of a plot by foreign actors to penetrate the House of Representatives and its computers? There has been speculation by some conservative journalists and experts that they may have had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. A former CIA officer told me she worries that the three Awad brothers, who reportedly are Pakistani immigrants, may have ties to the Pakistani intelligence service, ISI. While the political and faction associations are very fluid and complicated in the Middle East, it can be boiled down to [Shia and Sunni](URL interests in a very Broad sense. Iran and Syria are Shia while Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Pakistan are Sunni and they are fighting for control of the new Caliphate. [This is very broad and in its application difficult](URL but essentially true. This Why it is important to identify the players. Could the Awan brothers have been working for the ISI or Iran? This would also provide some insight to the motivation of the theft of data. Were the Awan brothers supplying information to Iranians during the nuclear talks? That would really define their motives, but we are left with more questions than answers. [Syria's Other Foreign Fighters: Iran's Afghan and Pakistani Mercenaries](URL &gt;A major reason for the disparity is that most accounts of the Afghan and Pakistani troops fighting under the Hezbollah flag in Syria mistakenly tend to minimize their ideological motivations. However, the Shia foreign fighter phenomenon could have serious ramifications for South Asia, because it serves as a pretense under which Tehran trains and indoctrinates militant Shia populations.  Enter Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. While this is not an overt connection, but much like political corruption, individuals committing these types of crimes attempt to be careful. While many ultimately fail, they think through their moves and are harder to catch. Most complicated crimes, organized crime, financial crimes, computer crimes, are not discovered through direct evidence, but are uncovered through a [pattern of behavior](URL Remember they got Al Capone for tax evasion not boot legging or murder. &gt;Update: New concerns that this may have been an attempt by a foreign Jihadist organization to penetrate the House computer system arose this week in reports by The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal that the Awan brothers owed money to Dr. Ali al-Attar, an Iraqi political figure who allegedly has connections to Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed terrorist group. ###Who Is Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D The first thing that comes up is he was [suspended](URL Proxy Highlight) from practicing medicine - Maryland Board of Physicians charged Ali A. Al-Attar, M.D., a physician licensed to practice medicine in the State of Maryland. Dr . Al-Attar's failure to cooperate with the Board investigation was said to be deliberate by the board. Currently Dr. Ali al-Attar is wanted for tax evasion and defrauding [the medicare system](URL After losing his medical license in November of 2010 Al-Attar got to know the Awan brothers well enough to provide them an unsecured loan for $100,000. I'm sensing a relationship there. &gt;[Philip Giraldi](URL a former Central Intelligence Agency officer, wrote that Dr. Ali Al-Attar was observed in Beirut, Lebanon conversing with a Hezbollah official in 2012shortly after the loan was made. While Al-Attar was born in Iraq his parents were Iranian. At various times during the Bush administration, beginning in 2002, Al-Attar met with then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz along with a cadre of other Iraqi dissidents opposed to [Saddam Hussein](URL to discuss the war, Al-Attar has also been accused of helping provoke the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Between 2002 and 2012 Al-Attar became disaffected with American actions in Iraq and began to formulate plans with Hezbollah. This would be reasonable considering his Iranian heritage. How does this bring Al-Attar and the Awan brothers together. This is another fact I glossed over not understanding the true significance of the brothers car dealership Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. [How Radical Islam Penetrated The U.S. House of Representatives](URL &gt;And it is very interesting how the car dealerships finances were strangely interwoven with those of the U.S. House of Representatives. A car-dealing associate who was owed money by the brothers, Rao Abbas, also a Muslim, was placed on the congressional payroll. &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. Imran actually got Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy to place Rao Abbasi on his payroll. It is likely that Rao simply ran the dealership and got paid for being a part of the Awan crew. This seems like fraud to me. Isn't the FBI supposed to ask politicians about the misappropriation of funds? We'll come back to Rao in a moment. &gt;Imram later acted as [owner since CIA](URL was considered family business by the Awans, Abids one-time business partner, Nasir Khattak, said in court documents. The car dealerships finances consisted of byzantine transfers in which staff and cars were often swapped between it and a dealership next door, Khattak said. Lets look again at the car dealership, CIA (Cars International A). The records show a [confusing tangle of sales](URL and trades, but despite the 5 million the brothers took in from their work as congressional staffers, the brothers were constantly in debt. Imran brought in about 150 grand a year between himself and the 2 wives also brought in 6 figure salaries. Now we have Hezbollah-Connected Dr. Al-Attar putting cash in to the dealership after fleeing the country. At about the same time he is meeting with a Hezbollah leader, and Hezbollah gets busted for laundering drug money with used cars and consumer goods from China. The documentation for the business was in shambles and Imran maintained control of the dealers license. In essence, Imran was able to front for Hezbollah in their auto trading. Also while heavily in debt Imran was able to mass a portfolio of real estate properties. &gt;In addition to his other jobs, [Imran is a real estate agent](URL and Khattak is also a realtor who obtained the cash from Al-Attar and passed it through bank accounts used for real estate deals in Fairfax County, Va. &gt;Having lost my and Abids collective investment of $500k due to Awans mismanagement, [CIA] was further in debt $400k to other creditors, Khattak said in a lawsuit. While it is obvious Imran had some fairly sloppy business practices and was predatory to his partners he also was well suited to launder funds for Hezbollah. Imran had obtained the licenses necessary to support what had by this time become a model for moving money throughout the world. Several arrests have been made showing Hezbollah buys used American cars, ships them to Africa for sale or trade for drugs. At the same time Chinese consumer goods are being shipped to South America to trade for drugs in South America. Money is made from the transport and sale of drugs in to Europe from South America and Africa. The profits are then used to buy more vehicles in North America and consumer goods in China. The money is then laundered by banks like the Lebanese Canadian Bank with some of the money being siphoned off to pay for further terrorist activities. Beyond supporting their terrorist activities they also expand their allies and support in Africa, Central, and South America creating an international presence. It may be a coincidence that Imrans businesses model gots ideally in to the current standard fir money laundering by Hezbollah, but it is an amazing coincidence if it was accidental. ###[Hezbollah laundered money with used-car sales, U.S. says](URL &gt;NEW YORK (Bloomberg) -- Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Lebanese exchange houses helped launder more than $480 million for the Hezbollah terrorist group in a scheme that involved buying and selling used cars, the U.S. said in a civil complaint today. &gt;Federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in Manhattan claiming the defendants took money from Lebanon to buy used cars in the U.S. and sell them in West Africa. Here is where I begin to speculate. Imran, at this point, has infiltrated or highest levels of security and at the very least has the ability to run the most compromising surveillance operation of the Democrat party, the Congress, the United States government and intelligence initiatives in history. The story of the break-ins makes the hillary server small potatoes. hillary may have opened foggy bottom to the world while she was sec state, but the Awan brothers gave congress to the Iranians, the Pakistanis, or given his predatory business practices, both of them. Then while Imran is compromising Congress he also builds a business that integrates perfectly in to Hezbollah's business model. What if Al-Attar was a fictional partner. The Keiser Sosei as it were for the business. Insane right? There is no way it's possible the business partner who hasn't been seen in the United States since 2010 didn't even exist right. The money trail is there. There are documents, loans, paperwork. Are you sure? [EXCLUSIVE: House Dem IT Guys In Security Probe Secretly Took $100K In Iraqi Money](URL &gt;Abid claimed the Iraqi doctor may never have existed. If as suspected, all of this is a charade, particularly if it is learned the mysterious Dr. Al-Attar doesnt exist or didnt sign the documents, then the whole matter rises to a higher level, he said in court documents. ###I want you to remember as quoted above... &gt;Abbas is listed as the IT professional for former Democratic Representative Patrick Murphy, a then-member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Subcommittee on Department of Defense, Intelligence and Overhead Architecture and (irony alert) Subcommittee on the NSA and Cybersecurity. &gt;By 2009, the family was simultaneously managing a full-time car dealership in Virginia, with Abid running day-to-day operations after contributing $250,000 in startup cash. It was called Cars International A, LLC, referred to as CIA in court documents. &gt;Imran boasted unusual clout among House Democrats, and was even pictured conversing with former President Bill Clinton. After Rao Abbas, who was owed money by the dealership, threatened to sue amid allegations of deception and theft, Abbas appeared on the congressional payroll and received $250,000 in taxpayer payments. ###And Debbie Wasserman Schultz refuses to fire Imran Awan. What's going on here? Imran is still on Debbie Wasserman Schultz's payroll as a [consultant](URL Wasn't Imran at IT consultant? His access to the House of Representatives and more importantly the House computer systems has been revoked. What exactly is Imran consulting on? I'm sorry I don't have answers for this one, but it definitely makes no sense. This anomaly is so strange it requires more investigation. #Where are we at so far? We have 4 brothers and 2 wives start doing work for congress. Imran gets a job with Rep Gregory Meeks. The next year he also getting Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jackie Speers to put him on their payroll. From there he manages to work in his brothers and Rao Abbasi on to the congressional payroll for an, as of yet, unspecified number of Congressmen (Somewhere above 30) Imran is pulling down somewhere around $150,000 and the others are getting between $100,000 and $150,000 apiece. Three times the normal salary for other staffers. How ya feelin' about your tax dollars now? Most likely, the brothers ran a social engineering hack to bypass security protocols and compromised congressional data security. What does that mean? They asked for passwords and access to computer systems and networks, and their congressional clients handed them the access. Additionally they most likely ran a surveillance operation and compromised a number Congressional Representatives. The brothers also established the frame work for Hezbollah to launder money for various items including narcotics to fund world wide operations. Either they did support Hezbollah or stumbled on the perfect operation. Incidentally the operation is perfect for support for Iranian intelligence to follow the progress of the Iranian deal. Yes, I know Imran arrived in 2005, but these operations progress and evolve as opportunities present themselves. No one knew how [Valerie Jarrett](URL obama's senior advisor, was born in Iran and maintained ties to Iran and CPUSA. The presumed next administration, hillary, had [Huma Abidin](URL She has ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, a Sunni group. Remember Iran, Shia, and the Saudis, Sunni, the Muslim Brotherhood are fighting for control of the Middle East. Now ask yourself why the Awan brothers were booking it to Iran before October 16th, 2016. This is supposition, but the pieces really look like they could fit. Especially if we have not entirely understood the nuances of the operation. This looks very similar to Russian operations exposed in the [Venona papers](URL and books like [Black Listed by History](URL by M. Stanton Evans. A great read if your in to true Capitol Hill intrigue. McCarthy wasn't the man you think he was. I bring this up because these operations are much like the Cold War Era KGB Ops. Funny how the Iranians cozy up to the Russians and an intelligence operation that had their fingerprints all over it resembles something the GRU or FSB would roll out.

Many of them were in several sources, however, a lot of the conclusions in this piece are suppositions, but they do fit together nicely. Each piece is supported and sets the foundation for the next piece. That is really what makes it work. I didn't know the answer when I started this piece.

IISS also said that CrowdStrike erroneously used IISS data as proof of the intrusion. IISS disavowed any connection to the CrowdStrike report.

A government watchdog agency is investigating allegations that Department of Homeland Security officials improperly attempted to breach the Georgia secretary of states internal elections network last year. In a Jan. 17 letter to Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, DHS Inspector General John Roth said his office was probing a series of ten alleged scanning events of the Georgia Secretary of States network that may have originated from DHS-affiliated IP addresses. DHS IG spokeswoman Erica Paulson confirmed the office has launched an investigation. So when I found this story this morning about DHS employees being locked out of the computer system, I felt it could be related to the DHS hacking incident. At the time the State of Georgia reported this incident to DHS Director Jeh Johnson he made an excuse that an employee had made an error and cause the problem. We know that sounds fishy.

According to a Dec. 8 letter from Kemp to then-Secretary Jeh Johnson, the states third-party cybersecurity provider detected a large unblocked scan event on the morning of Nov. 15, several days after the election.

A lot of it deserves more context, which I gave on my Wordpress, but will be less here because of room. I archived everything on the Wordpress too in case they delete anything. So let's start, don't want to waste room. Elon Musk being lied to about what Neil Armstrong and Eugene Cernan said on 60 minutes. [Video](URL Proof that the 60 minute reporter lied: [here](URL Here is 60 minutes apologizing: [here](URL ____ [Here](URL Is a video of 60 minutes pushing for soundbites. ____ [Here](URL is a video of Tucker Carlson having a guy named ""Dom Tullipso on his show"". The guy claimed to be an anti-trump protester, that paid people to protest against Trump. Turned out the guy was trolling and it was all a hoax. His name isn't even real. The Washington Times, TownHall, Inforwars, Truthfeed, and Gateway Pundit on this guys story, before realizing it was a hoax. Some of them did updates, but The Washington Times just changed their whole story (have the archive before and after on my wordpress), and some didn't update at all. ______ CNN Chris Cuomo said it was illegal to possess the Wikileaks documents [here](URL This is a complete lie. The First Amendment offers the same protection to the media as to the rest of us, including possessing illegal documents, as long as you werent involved in the original illegal hack. [here](URL is the proof of that. ______ CNN covers unfolding crime stories happening in two different cities from the same parking lot. Basically they are just pretending to be in two different cities. [here](URL is the video for that. ________ NBC Caught Lying About Chevrolet Trucks Exploding: [here](URL ____________ Brian Williams From NBC Lies Multiple Times About Being Shot Down In Iraq: [here](URL ________ MSNBC lies about Fox news, and RNC, having their Christmas party at Trump hotels: [here](URL ________ NBC Today Show Correspondent Pretends To Row A Canoe In Deep Water During A Storm, But Its Only 6 Inches Deep: [here](URL _________ Fox News lies about unanimous vote split for Obama : [here](URL _____________ MSNBC crops video to incite racial tension over AR-15 at Obama rally: [Here](URL ________ Media caught editing what an African American kid said to make it seem like he wanted to use guns when he grew up: [here](URL ____ NBC edited the Zimmerman 911 tape, to make it seem like he was being racist in the 911 call: [here](URL _____ CNN altering Donald Trumps tweets from Twitter: [here](URL ________ [here](URL is a picture of what Trump said, vs how the media took it. Tons of media outlets actually. ___ [Here](URL is an article showing that the media lied about why Iranians were protesting. ______ [Here](URL is video of CNN editing out Sylville Smith's call for violence. ____ [here](URL is John Broder from NYT lying about Telsa. [Here](URL is Telsa proving he is lying, with graphs and everything. _____ CNN calls Assange from Wikileaks a pedophile without any evidence backing the claims: [here](URL I have a lot more [here](URL ( &lt;&lt; here is the wordpress if you click that) and by a lot more, sadly I mean tons and tons more. You can just go to the top link ""Media lies"" and it will show ""videos"", ""pictures"", and ""articles"". Click any of them and go to February and then it will show you everything. I wanted to organize it so it's easier to read, and you don't have a never ending scrolling page. If you have any type of video, picture, or article of the media lying or showing extreme bias please link them below and I will review and add it to the site. I'm sorry btw for the Wordpress not having an actual domain, I'll get it eventually. If you see anything on the site that is wrong, please tell me, I worked hard on it, and want it to be perfect! I will continue to update as much as I can too. Anytime I find anything, and plan on doing my own research in the next couple of days on stories I know that are complete lies, but need to get all the sources proving it. Also, any ads on the Wordpress are not mine. They are Wordpress ads. If you want to get rid of them use Ublock or Adblock of course. Enjoy. "

Not so much is know about her relation to Civil Society which parallels Open Society and shares many of the same sponsors. But there IS a relationship, and Civil Society wanted Clinton elected too. URL In 2011, the Omidyar Group, a Civil Society sponsor, created Democracy Fund (DF) and Democracy Fund Voice (DFV). URL The web site states ""Democracy Fund DOES NOT (their emphasis) accept unsolicited proposals. We proactively seek new grants based on strategic priorities and typically identify new grantee partners from within our network of allies and contacts. We work closely with grantee partners to help them achieve their goals. URL While DF created the ""nut and bolts,"" DFV ""greased the machine"" through ""bipartisan"" initiatives that included ad hoc conferences with Congressional Members. In 2011, DF began funding Pews Election Initiatives program to develop a voter registration database, the Electronic Registration Information Center (ERIC.) URL Was this choice related to Tamera Luzzatto, a Pew Senior VP and former COS to Sen, Clinton and David Rockefeller? URL and URL ERIC was released in 2012. In June of 2012, Hillary Clinton had a one-hour closed-press/off-the-record meeting with the Pew Foundation Board of Directors. URL In comparison to other voter registration systems, ERIC incorporates a wider range of data, including SSA, DMV and Human Services. ERIC includes not only registered voters but also those who are eligible to vote but not registered - a cornucopia of demographic data. ERIC also has access to the Social Security Death Index which leads one to ask why some of the earliest ERIC states had the highest incidence of deceased ""voters."" In 2013, based on requests from various organizations (all funded by DF,) Obama signed an executive order creating the Presidential Commission on Election Administration (PCEA.) Most of the PCEA members were connected to Pew or and/or to entities receiving grants from DF. URL (DF funded) On advice from the ""stacked"" PCEA, Obama appointed three EAC commissioners, all tied to DF grantees. URL The EAC Standards Board (SB) was reactivated in 2015, and within a month Project 1622's common-data-format for the electronic generation of blank ballots was approved. (Project 1622 was a private work group that commenced in 2009.) Intentional or not, the EAC SB deactivation allowed Project 1622 to be developed without oversight, and the re-activation coincided with Project 1622's completion - essentially eliminating competition from other technology developers. URL Meanwhile, DF funded Civic Designs' development of a Remote Ballot Marking System (RBMS.) URL Ohio (a recent ERIC join) indicated they were ""testing"" Random Ballot Marking Systems (RBMS) in the general election. URL /66C4E49C7F2DBF95F210154B8463E04343B149CF That proves RBMS was operable - probably in at least the 21 ERIC states. On September 27, 2016 the NCSL ( DF grantee) released Electronic Transmission of Ballots States. URL Clearly, access to voter databases, the ability to create blank electronic ballots for any precinct and remotely mark them could be dangerous in the wrong hands. In late 2015, Pew amplified its ERIC marketing, particularly in closed primary states. David Becker, enjoined the PCEA, NCSL and other DF grantees, to market ERIC. Incumbents who promoted ERIC received contributions from out-of-state individuals, seemingly unrelated Pew employees, and Emily's List. In late 2015, Pew began offering grants to states who joined ERIC and transferred all their voter information by May 31, 2016. Why? Pew also gave states funding to cover mailing costs of registration postcards to eligible voters. (Were cards mailed to all eligible voters, or were they filtered by demographics?) States were joining ERIC as late as July of 2016. After this flurry of activity, Pew surprisingly announced in August that they were ""winding down"" their election programs due to ""funding cuts."" Within a month, Becker and Amy Cohen (Director, Pew's Voting Information Project, a partnership with Google) formed ""Election Innovations"" which appears related to ITIF, an Omidyar organization. Becker testified at the Science Committee Hearing on Cybersecurity in Elections in September. URL DF's influence also extended to Vote By Mail (VBM.) Tammy Patrick, VBM National Coordinator, had ties to Pew, the PCEA, Bipartisan Policy Institute (a DFgrantee,) and Project1622. Prior to the general election, Patrick sent a letter to USPS, explaining she did not want USPS to be burdened by the influx of ballots and would provide her own staff to handle the operation. Interestingly, the USPS link for election mail resources leads to Election Center (a DF grantee) URL and URL The Director of Election Center, Tim Mattice, is a Project1622 and TGDC member. Despite an entire SYSTEM built to stop him, Trump triumphed. That says something about Trump. It says something about his supporters. And it says something about the motives of a group that went to great lengths to get Clinton elected. Were they looking at four years or for-ever? My money's on the latter. ELECTORAL REFORM 2017!"

Ted Lieu of California called for an immediate congressional investigation. &gt; ""I am deeply disturbed by the allegation that the CIA lost its arsenal of hacking tools. The ramifications could be devastating,"" he said in a statement. """"We need to know if the CIA lost control of its hacking tools, who may have those tools, and how do we now protect the privacy of Americans."" &gt; ""The potential privacy concerns are mind-boggling,"" he said. &gt; Wikileaks said it published the documents to show the potentially hazardous ramifications of the CIA's covert hacking program -- and the massive theft of those tools. &gt; ""There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber 'weapons,'"" said WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange in a statement. &gt; Wikileaks, an outfit that believes in transparency, backed up the claims by publishing a massive trove of what it says are secret CIA documents. It calls the collection ""Year Zero,"" and it consists of 8,761 documents and files. &gt; The CIA, citing standing policy, declined to say whether the published documents are genuine. &gt; ""We do not comment on the authenticity or content of purported intelligence documents,"" said CIA spokeswoman Heather Fritz Horniak. &gt; ###Shocking claims &gt; Wikileaks portrays the CIA as a powerful hacking organization that has managed to infiltrate common personal devices -- with the power to spy on nearly everybody's personal lives. &gt; **CIA frames other hackers:** The CIA rules say that its hackers must use cyberweapons in a way that can't get traced back to the ""CIA, U.S. government, or its witting partner companies,"" according to Wikileaks. &gt; After a person, company or government gets hacked, cybersecurity experts worldwide are typically hired to conduct reviews. These reviews of tools and techniques usually allow someone to identify the attacker. &gt; Wikileaks said there's an entire department within the CIA whose job it is to ""misdirect attribution by leaving behind the 'fingerprints'"" of others, such as hackers in Russia. &gt; Cybersecurity experts have repeatedly [warned against the tendency to quickly blame a nation for a particular hack](URL This revelation could lend further credence to those, like President Trump, who doubt whether [Russia did indeed hack the Democrats](URL in an attempt to sway the recent American election. &gt; **Phones, TVs spy on you:** A team within the CIA developed spy software that infects Samsung smart TVs -- placing televisions on a ""fake-off"" mode that still listens to conversations and sends them back to American spies, Wikileaks claimed. The program, called ""Weeping Angel,"" was created with the help of the British spying agency MI5, it said. &gt; Wikileaks reports that another team within the CIA built hacking tools that can remotely control iPhones, iPads and Android devices -- secretly taking video from the camera, listening with the microphone, and tracking your location. &gt; In the past, consumers have been warned that [Samsung TVs were eavesdropping on private conversations](URL -- with the microphones implanted into the TV. &gt; CNN has also reported how [the NSA can ""turn on"" your phone remotely](URL But it was not previously known that the CIA has a similar capability. &gt; Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung -- whose products were mentioned by Wikileaks -- did not immediately provide comment to CNN. &gt; People who are careful about their privacy have resorted to encrypted apps to place phone calls and send text messages. The most common are Signal and WhatsApp. &gt; Wikileaks pointed out that if a phone is infected by the CIA, spies could potentially still monitor communications. Cybersecurity experts have long noted that an infected device should be considered ""compromised."" &gt; It's currently impossible for the average person to know if their phone, computer, or TV has been hacked by the CIA. &gt; **Potential car hacking:** Wikileaks also claims that the CIA in October 2014 was exploring the possibility of infecting the internet-connected systems of modern cars. In the past, [CNN has documented how car hacking is a real possibility](URL Cybersecurity experts have long suspected the U.S. government has developed this capability. &gt; **Wikileaks says U.S. consulate in Germany is a secret American hacking base:** Several U.S. State Department employees who work out of the consulate in Frankfurt, Germany are actually undercover CIA hackers who spy on Africa, Europe, and the Middle East, according to Wikileaks. &gt; ###Proving the documents are real &gt; Wikileaks has a long history of publishing authentic documents that have been stolen or leaked from government agencies, corporations and powerful individuals. However, this latest batch has not been authenticated by independent experts. CNN is reviewing the material. &gt; In its statement on Tuesday, Wikileaks said it withheld immediately publishing technical details about the malware allegedly used by CIA to prevent it from dispersing online. However, if and when those technical details are made public, computer experts could use them to track CIA hacking activity. &gt; For example, cybersecurity researchers can pull together new information on alleged CIA hacking techniques and compare it with existing evidence of past cyberattacks. It's an effort that could potentially prove whether the CIA hacked a specific person, company or government. &gt; *CNN's Ryan Browne contributed to this story.* &gt; *^CNNMoney ^\(New ^York\) ^First ^published ^March ^7, ^2017: ^2:26 ^PM ^ET*"

Edgar Hoover's FBI - The FISA court secretly grants warrants for wiretaps, telephone record traces and physical searches to the Justice Department. - Both judges had insisted that no information obtained this way be used to gain warrants from their court, according to government sources, and both had been assured by administration officials it would never happen. - **Both presiding judges agreed not to disclose the secret program to the 10 other FISA judges, who routinely handled some of the government's most highly classified secrets.** - **The two heads of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court were the only judges in the country briefed by the administration on Bush's program.** The president's secret order allows the National Security Agency to monitor telephone calls and e-mails between people in the United States and contacts overseas. # They convinced the judges to swear to secrecy, then THEY LIED TO THE JUDGES - Twice in the past four years (2002-2006), a top **Justice Department lawyer warned the presiding judge of a secret surveillance court that information overheard in President Bush's eavesdropping program may have been improperly used to obtain wiretap warrants** in the court, according to two sources with knowledge of those events. - **Between 1979 and 2004, it approved 18,748 warrants and rejected five.** - So early in 2002, they decided that any case in which the government listened to someone's calls without a warrant, and later developed information to seek a FISA warrant for that same suspect, was to be carefully ""tagged"" as having involved some NSA information. - Shortly after the warrantless eavesdropping program began, then-NSA Director Michael V. Hayden and Ashcroft made clear in private meetings that the president wanted to detect possible terrorist activity before another attack. They also made clear that, in such a broad hunt for suspicious patterns and activities, the government could never meet the FISA court's probable-cause requirement, government officials said. # Townsend is a liar. # SECRET COURT SAYS FBI MISLED JUDGES IN 75 CASES | [NEW YORK TIMES](URL | AUG 23, 2002 - The nation's secret intelligence court has identified more than 75 cases in which it says it was misled by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in documents in which the bureau attempted to justify its need for wiretaps and other electronic surveillance, according to the first of the court's rulings to be released publicly. - In its opinion, the court rejected a secret request made by the Justice Department this year to allow broader cooperation and evidence-sharing between counterintelligence investigators and criminal prosecutors. - FBI. and the Justice Department tried to defy the will of Congress by allowing intelligence material to be shared freely with criminal investigators. - The standards of evidence required for electronic surveillance are much lower in many intelligence investigations than in criminal investigations, the authors of the law wanted to prevent the dissemination of intelligence information to criminal investigators or prosecutors. - In a number of cases the FBI and the Justice Department had made ''erroneous statements'' in eavesdropping applications about ''the separation of the overlapping intelligence and criminal investigators and the **unauthorized sharing of FISA information with FBI criminal investigators and assistant U.S. attorneys.**'' - The court said that the FBI and the Justice Department were violating the law by allowing information gathered from intelligence eavesdrops to be used freely in bringing criminal charges, without court review, and that criminal investigators were improperly directing the use of counterintelligence wiretaps. - In one case, it said, the error appeared in a statement **issued by the office of Louis J. Freeh, then the FBI director, in which the bureau said that target of an intelligence eavesdropping request ''was not under criminal investigation.''** - In March of 2001, the court said, ''the government reported similar misstatements in another series of FISA applications in which there was **supposed to be a 'wall' between separate intelligence and criminal squads in FBI field offices to screen FISA intercepts**, when in fact **all of the FBI agents were on the same squad and all of the screening was done by the one supervisor overseeing both investigations.** &amp;nbsp; # Bush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts | [NEW YORK TIMES](URL | DEC 16, 2005 - Months after the Sept. 11 attacks, President Bush secretly authorized the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on Americans and others inside the United States to search for evidence of terrorist activity without the court-approved warrants ordinarily required for domestic spying, according to government officials. - The previously undisclosed decision to permit some eavesdropping inside the country without court approval was a major shift in American intelligence-gathering practices, particularly for the National Security Agency, whose mission is to spy on communications abroad. - Nearly a dozen current and former officials, who were granted anonymity because of the classified nature of the program, discussed it with reporters for The New York Times because of their concerns about the operation's legality and oversight. - **Administration officials are confident that existing safeguards are sufficient to protect the privacy and civil liberties of Americans.** - **The White House asked The New York Times not to publish this article, arguing that it could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would-be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny.** - President Bush significantly eased limits on American intelligence and law enforcement agencies and the military. - The NSA breaks codes and maintains listening posts around the world to eavesdrop on foreign governments, diplomats and trade negotiators as well as drug lords and terrorists. - Traditionally, the FBI, not the NSA, seeks such warrants and conducts most domestic eavesdropping. Until the new program began, the N.S.A. typically limited its domestic surveillance to foreign embassies and missions in Washington, New York and other cities, and obtained court orders to do so. - **Since 2002, the agency has been conducting some warrantless eavesdropping on people in the United States.** &amp;nbsp; # An Outsider's Quick Rise To Bush Terror Adviser  Frances Townsend | [WASHINGTON POST](URL | AUG 27, 2005 - She rushed through American University in three years. - She became a key adviser to Janet Reno. - Early work on mob cases led Rudolph W.

At the time, the Coast Guard was not part of the intelligence community and thus was not allowed to share sensitive information. - She helped the Coast Guard get added to intelligence legislation and transformed the agency's priority from South American drug-smuggling to the vulnerability of America's ports. - In Spring of 2003, Richard Clarke and General John A Gordon (Bushs Homeland Security Chief) lobbied for Townsend, and as a result she was hired on to the **National Security Council.** &amp;nbsp; - **Frances Townsend runs President Bush's far-flung campaign against terrorism.** - **""She obviously has the confidence of the president, and that has a huge impact on her ability to influence the process,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff.** &amp;nbsp; - **She is the coordinator, the facilitator, the bridge, as FBI Director Robert S.

Clarke.** # Townsend has overseen an intelligence reorganization and is now directing the first White House review of its anti-terrorism campaign since the aftermath of Sept. 11, a process intended to broaden the struggle into a new strategy against violent extremism. - Until a few months prior to 9/11, **she had run the Justice Department's Office of Intelligence Policy and Review that decided which cases merited **supersecret intelligence wiretaps**, work that took her inside al Qaeda cases, such as the **1998 embassy bombings in Africa.** - **Her office would be a focus of controversy after Sept. 11. As the gatekeeper for intelligence wiretap requests**, Townsend's office fought efforts to invoke the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in matters that could result in criminal cases, fearing that prosecutors would use such surveillance to circumvent the more difficult threshold for obtaining a criminal wiretap. **In practical terms, the result was what commission reports called ""The Wall,"" fencing off investigators from potentially useful information about suspects on American soil.** - In an example cited by a bipartisan congressional commission, Townsend refused to endorse a secret intelligence wiretap on Los Alamos National Laboratories scientist Wen Ho Lee because the FBI's interest in the case was ""way too criminal."" &amp;nbsp; # FBI Announces Restructuring | [FBI](URL | JUL 26, 2006 - Director Robert S.

The Democratic National Committees lousy IT security allowed someone to access their emails which were then leaked. Clintons campaign manager John Podesta fell for an age-old phishing scam that was as believable as getting millions of dollars from a Nigerian prince. Using the spotty media understanding of cybersecurity, they can claim that the DNC and Hillarys campaign were hacked, but the election decisively was not. And the press knows it. In order to hack an election, a nefarious group would have to infiltrate the voting systems of 50 states, plus DC and territories. All of these systems are unique, with completely different architecture, ballot formats, tabulation processes, etc., etc. This did not happen. In fact, some hackers tried breaking into a few different states systems weeks before the election, were quickly identified, and prevented from doing so. Likewise, someone attempted to gain illegal access to the Republican National Committee, but since they had a competent IT staff, this too was thwarted. But even without delving into the technical details, its obvious that the election wasnt hacked. If, say, Russia wanted to elect Trump, they would have given him the popular vote victory along with his electoral victory. They also wouldnt have left him to squeak out meager wins across the upper midwest and rust belt. The media is intentionally lying to the public because they want a better excuse for Election Day than the reality. They would rather focus on hacking, the popular vote, FBI Director James Comey, or the minuscule alt-right, instead of accepting that American voters slightly preferred Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton, at least in the states where it counted. People wanted change over the ineptness, cronyism, and stagnation of the Obama era. They didnt trust the utterly untrustable Clinton and liked her even less. The harsh reality is this: Hillary Clinton is the worst presidential nominee in American history. And if the media is actually concerned about fake news, they will drop the election hacking lie and just admit that their candidate was a disaster."

First, I do believe that the Russians and many hacking groups in general may have compromised the DNC. From many indications it seems that the DNC employees were not especially careful with their security practices. And they may have even been compromised in the way described, my critique was not on the possibility but on the lack of details provided by the ""report"". Some areas that the report did not cover but many journalist are just ""filling in"" with their assumptions includes: 1. That the spear phishing attack was done with the intention of affecting the election. 2. That the information attained by the spear phishing attack was given to Wikileaks or any one else. Hence, there was nothing in the report to indicate that the attack was anything more then hacks of opportunity or that the information was provided to Wikileaks with the intention of disrupting the elections."

The Joint Analysis Report from the FBI contains an appendix that lists hundreds of IP addresses that were supposedly used by Russian civilian and military intelligence services. While some of those IP addresses are from Russia, the majority are from all over the world, which means that the hackers constantly faked their location. McAfee argues that the report is a fallacy, explaining that hackers can fake their location, their language, and any markers that could lead back to them. Any hacker who had the skills to hack into the DNC would also be able to hide their tracks, he said If I was the Chinese and I wanted to make it look like the Russians did it, I would use Russian language within the code, I would use Russian techniques of breaking into the organization, McAfee said, adding that, in the end, there simply is no way to assign a source for any attack. However, McAfee does see a problem with the National Security Agency (NSA) being able to listen in on every conversation and read every text message and email of every American. Rather than focusing on disrupting the bad guys in foreign countries, McAfee thinks that all of that effort has been placed on a country that is afraid of its own citizens. He claims that the only way he has been able to fully block the NSA from infecting his phone with spyware is by using a flip-phone too old to be hacked. He even goes as far as to call the iPhone the ultimate spy device. As for the future, McAfees biggest fear is that the role of the NSA will change under a President Donald Trump. Donald Trump wants the DOJ to head a national task force of law enforcement agencies to create our cybersecurity, he says. McAfee predicts that if President-elect Trump follows through with that intention, the FBI will end up heading the NSA, as they are the lead technologists within the DOJ. McAfee thinks that idea is a recipe for disaster, warning we dont need one more attacker, that attacker being our own government."

Not necessarily a bad thing, but would be nice to see a deal that benefits both sides not just Exxon/Rosneft as sanctions lifted in Russia would be HUGE for Exxon and Rosneft/Putin/Igor Sechin (Dep Prime Minister who's also chairmen for Rosneft). &gt; In return for granting unprecedented access to Russia's hydrocarbon reserves, Rosneft will receive equity stakes in at least six ExxonMobil projects including tight oil in Texas and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson signed the deal in Sochi. "

Soros trying to steal the election and start war!",92,58utas,https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/58utas/centipedes_muh_russians_narrative_is_false_get/,2016-10-23 06:40:26,"I want to warn you that this is long so to start off let me give you the TLDR; **When Soros and the DNC learned that they had been hacked, they immediately needed to devise a plan that not only discredited the leaks, but framed a narrative that would support their candidate Hillary Clinton. They used the Guccifer 2.0 account and their corrupt media to place blame on the Russians (and Trump). Below I'm going to connect the dots for you and reveal why Soros is manipulating our election.** Now for the details of how they created a narrative to squash Trump and escalate war with Russia. * If you watch this video, you get an inside peak to the Russian mindset. URL After watching that video you should be asking yourself, ""what does the Russian government have to gain with such a high risk move?"" * Wikileaks has been around for a while, and the hacks have been occuring for sometime * Donald Trump is not a Russian Plant and there would be no way of knowing he would win the Republican Nominee. He also received no direct help from Wikileaks or other hacking groups during the primaries * 16 Other Republican Candidates were a part of the primary, most like Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina were very Anti-Russia * The Russians have no way of knowing if Trump is pro-Russian. All they have is his word, since he has no track record to run on for policy decisions. * The Russians didn't know that Hillary Clinton would employ Brownshirt Tactics and rig the DNC to win the Democratic Nominee. If they did know, they would have no idea that Jame's O'Keefe would blow the lid off it. Wikileaks started leaking information in June. Well before there was enough forward facing credible evidence to support the corruption claims. O'Keefe Videos URL URL **Now Let's Talk Hackers** Wikileaks has a perfect track record and has targeted the Clintons as early as 2010. They and other actors knowingly took advantage of the lack of technical security within some key servers. You're starting to see those leaks now. We also know that Wikileaks and Assange never reveal their sources. In the passed the U.S. government has had whistleblowers. Some examples are Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden. Another possibility could be **Seth Rich**. URL There's also been other high profile hackers in the passed like the original Guccifer and Anonymous. These hackers work independently from any one government. Hackers are notoriously hard to trace and can leave plenty of miscues on their trail. There's no way of knowing who was responsible for leaking this information. Unless of course someone comes forward to claim responsibility for the hacks. Enter **Guccifer 2.0** If you're not familiar with Guccifer 2.0, they are shoddy, unreliable, and produced nothing of any real worth. Their leaks consist of mostly forgeries, publicly known information or previous hacks. Guccifer 2.0 showed up on the scene claiming to be responsible for providing Wikileaks with the hacked DNC files within a week of the drop. No one has any previous knowledge of this person, but they claim to have hacked the Clinton Foundation, DNC, and other systems. If you read this article or as I would say, propaganda, a few things stand out. URL Making those emails public, say cybersecurity experts and US intelligence officials, is what shifted the hack from another Russian cyber-espionage operation to a game changer in the long-simmering USRussia cyberwar. Using the well-established WikiLeaks platform, as well as newly invented figureheads, ensured that the leaked emails got maximum exposure. Within 24 hours of the CrowdStrike report, a Twitter account under the name @Guccifer_2 was established and began tweeting about the hack on the DNC. One of thefirst tweets claimed responsibility for hacking the DNCs servers, and in subsequent private messages with journalists, including BuzzFeed News, the account claimed that it was run by a lone Romanian hacker, and that he alone had been responsible for hacking into the DNC servers and, later, the Clinton Foundation, as well as senior members of Clintons staff. The account offered to send BuzzFeed News emails from the hacks and appeared to make the same offer to several US publications, including Gawker and theSmoking Gun. Julian Assange, founder of the online leaking platform WikiLeaks Steffi Loos / AFP / Getty Images Within the week, WikiLeaks had published more than 19,000 DNC emails. Though WikiLeaks would not reveal the source, Guccifer 2.0 gleefully messaged journalists that he had been the source of the leak. Few bought the story  a language analysis on the Guccifer 2.0 account showed it made mistakes typical of Russian speakers, and when asked questions in Romanian by reporters in an online chat, Guccifer 2.0 appeared to not be able to answer. Meanwhile, metadata in the docs, such as Russian-language settings and software versions popular in Russia, ledcybersecurity experts to believe that not only were the emails leaked by Russia, but that Guccifer 2.0 was an account created by the Russian state to try and deflect attention. Why would a hacker working with Wikileaks who never reveal their sources ""gleefully"" contact the media and tell them they were responsible. They would simultaneously leave plenty of evidence behind they were Russian, despite the first Guccifer being Romanian. They would also leave behind forgeries, misinformation, to distract from the real leaks, yet be quoted as the source for Wikileaks in news articles. A few more key phrases from that article. Wikieleaks is described as a ""well established platform."" Guccifer 2.0 is described as a ""Newly Created Figurehead."" Who just happens to be conveniently Russian. This works perfectly for discrediting the leaks, matching Hillary's No-Fly Zone rhetoric, helps continue to push a Trump-Putin narrative and distracts from the real leaks and future leaks. Other redflag like articles pertaining to Guccifer 2.0: * URL * URL **Enter the Media** URL Here you have DNC Interim Chain Donna Brazile immediately trying to tie the leak to the GOP and presidential Nominee Donald Trump. ""Theres one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and thats Donald Trump,"" she said in a statement Tuesday night, adding that Trump has ""embraced"" Russian President Vladimir Putin and ""publicly encouraged further Russian espionage to help his campaign."" Trump claims his remarks were meant in jest and that he has no knowledge of who hacked the DNC. Brazile also urged people to use ""extreme caution"" when accessing the documents, cautioning that they may contain malicious espionage software. She said the DNC legal team is reviewing the documents to confirm their authenticity, and warned that ""it is common for Russian hackers to forge documents."" In one swift interview Donna Brazile who is proven to be corrupt by giving debate questions to HRC is telling you not to look at the emails because you'll get spyware. Just like CNN told you it's illegal to look at them and you can only learn through the media. Just in case you do look at them, be aware that some are forgeries (Only Guccifer 2.0's, which they always push forward when other reputable leaks happen). Whenever there is a REAL leak, they always conflate it with fake ones and false flag accounts like Guccifer 2.0 (who they tie to Russia). URL Notice the last part of that article. The reporters also noticed that this time around, Guccifer typed in broken English and mainly used emojis. In the past, Guccifer typed in near perfect English. URL I want you to focus on one character in that article. **Deray McKesson** URL The manufactured outrage of BLM due to the fake Guccifer 2.0 leaks comes from a guy who lives in a house owned by wealthy donors to none other than George Soros' Open Society Institute. McKesson has also visited with Obama around July 13. Just over a month before the fake leaks. This brings us back to other leaks. Like DCLeaks which were confirmed to be real by Colin Powell. **DCleaks shows Soros trying to destabilize Russia** Read these articles. This is important. URL URL **If you haven't seen the Ex-KGB defector explain how to subvert a nation. I suggest you red-pill yourself right here.** URL This got me thinking. I think that Russia was never intended to be painted into a big bad enemy this election cycle. I think the issues were going to be mostly social bullshit, but Trump changed the narrative there. He blew the lead off a lot of big problems, and then you had a series of attacks in Europe and the U.S. combined with the explosion of the great migration out of the Middle East. This is a huge problem for the Democrats now, especially since we know how they were created. Which is also why Barrack Obama is trying to squash ISIS asap, to erase that stain on the last 8 years. The Democrats can't focus on the problems they created, so they try to deflect and distract. Read this wikieleaks Podesta email. URL Let's not forget the ""Great reset"" Clinton had with Russia. That ultimately left to this quote. Last week, he dismissed criticism of the vote by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as part of US efforts to weaken Russia, and on Thursday he upped the ante by accusing US special forces of being involved in the killing of deposed Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi. ""Who did this?"" Putin said. ""Drones, including American ones. They attacked his column. Then - through the special forces, who should not have been there - they brought in the so-called opposition and fighters, and killed him without court or investigation."" A spokesman for the US military said the claim was ""ludicrous."" In a related aside, Mr Putin said John McCain, the US senator, was losing his mind, probably because of the torture he suffered as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. Putin was responding to remarks McCain made in October, when the former US presidential candidate said the killing of Col. Gaddafi should make ""dictators"" like Putin ""nervous."" Signalling that President Barack Obama's much publicized attempt to ""reset"" relations with Russia was now barely alive, Mr Putin added: ""Sometimes it seems to me that America does not need allies, it needs vassals. People are tired of the dictates of one country."" Russia has apparently been threatened by the Obama/Clinton administration for quite some time, and surely doesn't want a full blown war. They do see the destruction and wake that we've left in the region though. I don't doubt they pursue their own interests where they can. It seems super dangerous for them to get involved knowing the chance Hillary could win. She already made anti-Russian decisions as Secretary of State and had used anti-Russian rhetoric during the primaries. That's a big, big gamble and escalates tensions further. That is unless they believe because of the strain on our Alliances and terrible leadership of the passed 8 years we can not contest the Russian interests anymore in the ME and they don't fear retribution (no one wants war). Another, much more realistic option is they feel like the U.S. is screwing things up and poses as a very strong threat towards Russia and can't let Hillary become President at any cost (further destabilizes the world with her bad decisions and creates more hostility towards Russian interests and ultimately their stability which would result in War). In my mind its scenario two, but Russia would never take a risk this big to try to manipulate the election and is unfortunately at the mercy of the U.S. **This is why it is up to us Patriots. There is a global ploy to subvert our glorious Nation. Do not let Soros steal this election. Do not let them escalate war with Russia. They are criminals trying to manipulate you and bully their way to power. All of this is connected and a well concerted effort to remove your freedoms.** I believe the Clinton Foundation and other more serious leaks are coming. Stay Nimble, look for discrepancies and false flags. ALWAYS question the narrative, and get out and vote!"

There is a very real risk that the system was broken into, possibly by Republican operatives (or China or some other country or organization). If this has happened and if there is anything that might appear problematic in those emails, whether or not it actually is, the relevant emails might be released to the press shortly before the election. Even if the system was not broken into, there is the threat that opponents might release forged emails that are difficult to impossible to distinguish from real ones. &gt; In addition, there are questions that any computer security expert will ask, such as was the system backed up regularly. If so, then it might be possible at least to respond to forged emails. Of course the claim that the server has been wiped clean (was that also done with any backups that were created?) suggests that there may not be adequate backups. &gt; Incidentally, depending on how the deletions on the server were done, it might be possible for the email to be recovered by a forensics expert. &gt; **What should be done**. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to prevent the risks described above. &gt; Given that, it's important to know how real those risks might be. Therefore, I recommend that a forensics investigator be hired to examine the server and any backups and logs that might still exist to see if there may have been a break-in. &gt; Jeremy Epstein is a prominent computer security expert who has recommended a company called Mandiant. (Neither Jeremy nor I have any involvment with Mandiant of any kind, including financial). &gt; According to Jeremy, they are frequently brought in after major corporate breakins. They are verydiscrete and, in his view, competent. I can put anyone who is interested in touch with Jeremy, whoives in Virginia. &gt; In my opinion it is critical that a highly qualified forensics expert examine the system as soon aspossible. It is important to know if there may be a problem or if an attack may have occurred, so that there can be a well thought out response prepared beforehand. &gt; Finally, if nothing serious is uncovered by a forensics examination, that does not prove that nothing happened. Regrettably, the absence of proof of a break-in is not proof of the absence of a break-in. THIS EMAIL WAS SENT 2015-04-15 DURING THE BENGAHZI SHITSTORM! ZOMG!!! ZOMG: &gt;The companies are Fidelis Cybersecurity and Mandiant. They base their analysis on five malware samples used in the hacking attack. Fidelis executive Michael Buratowski says, Based on our comparative analysis, we agree with CrowdStrike and believe that the Cozy Bear and Fancy Beargroups were involved in successful intrusions at the DNC [Democratic National Committee] . [] The malware samples matched the description, form and function that was described in the CrowdStrike blog post. In addition, they were similar and at times identical to malware that other [research firms] have associated to these actor sets. URL Mandiant is one of the firms blaming RUSSIA! Coincidence?

Let me address three issues. First, we are tired of your long history of deposing leaders that you don't like in Iraq, Libya and elsewhere. Your interference during elections in Egypt and Latin America is also irritating. Moreover, we are sick of your selling weapons to extremist governments throughout the Middle East. And we are especially fed up with your legendary hubris... Never mind that last paragraph. My colleagues inform me that it wasn't you who did that stuff. Moving on to my second point, we are concerned that you are getting a little too aggressive with all the violations of cybersecurity around the world. The hacking of American systems, for the purpose of spying on our citizens, is reprehensible. And your spying on European allies is equally irritating. Excuse me. I am informed that there seems to be some ""complexity"" about exactly which nation's agencies were doing the hacking of American systems. Let me get back to you on that. The third point, however, I think is worth emphasizing. We would appreciate it if you'd stop ""dicking"" our bimbos. (Those were your words, I believe, not mine.) For one thing, they didn't ask to be dicked. For another, they don't actually like the way you are dicking them. If you could go ahead and stop it, that would be great. Sincerely, DD "

Yet in the emails excerpts of her Morgan Stanley speech, she lauded a presidential commission that proposed changes that would slash Social Security benefits, according to experts. The email shows Clinton specifically telling Morgan Stanley that the Simpson-Bowles commission put forth the right framework for dealing with fiscal challenges. She also said the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. As the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in 2011, that commission proposed a plan to cut benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients, weaken the link between a recipients benefits and past earnings (which could undermine public support for the program), and, despite the claims of the co-chairs, fail to protect most low-income workers from benefit cuts. ---------- Information from an email about a speech on Isis - not a paid speech **THROWING SHADE AT ARABS** Email Discussion about including disparaging comments about Arabs in Clinton speech on ISIS: ""We can throw some more shade at the Arabs, though.

""We now have a John Anzalone memorial paragraph in the speech."" (john anzalone is a Clinton's pollster, I think this is supposed to be a joke) URL -------- Information from an email about Israel - not a paid speech **ISRAEL** This email is from a Clinton surrogate who spoke with Netanyahu. We discussed possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians, like more Palestinian investment in Zone C, and/or an agreement to limit settlement expansion to the established blocs that under the Clinton parameters would be in Israel after any negotiation. Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, other than the guy in jail. (Added Marwan Barghouti) Israel Arabs are a real problem. The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population. But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and certainly the military and intelligence community, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a huge problem and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA.

Yet in the emails excerpts of her Morgan Stanley speech, she lauded a presidential commission that proposed changes that would slash Social Security benefits, according to experts. The email shows Clinton specifically telling Morgan Stanley that the Simpson-Bowles commission put forth the right framework for dealing with fiscal challenges. She also said the Simpson-Bowles framework and the big elements of it were right. As the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported in 2011, that commission proposed a plan to cut benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients, weaken the link between a recipients benefits and past earnings (which could undermine public support for the program), and, despite the claims of the co-chairs, fail to protect most low-income workers from benefit cuts. --------------- Edit: added information from an email about a speech on Isis - not a paid speech **THROWING SHADE AT ARABS** Email Discussion about including disparaging comments about Arabs in Clinton speech on ISIS: ""We can throw some more shade at the Arabs, though.

We discussed possible economic initiatives to help the Palestinians, like more Palestinian investment in Zone C, and/or an agreement to limit settlement expansion to the established blocs that under the Clinton parameters would be in Israel after any negotiation. Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, other than the guy in jail. (Added Marwan Barghouti) Israel Arabs are a real problem. The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population. But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and certainly the military and intelligence community, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a huge problem and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA.

Abu Mazan continues to talk about retiring, as he has done for years, but seems more serious now. There is no obvious successor if he leaves, other than the guy in jail. (Added Marwan Barghouti) Israel Arabs are a real problem. The government had to dismantle the northern branch of the Islamic Association because they were radicalizing the Israeli Arabs, who are 20% of the population. But the Prime Minister and the Defense Minster, and certainly the military and intelligence community, want to keep the PA. There is still intelligence sharing on radicals, but when Israel asks them to arrest the radicals they identify, they refuse, and ask the Israelis to do it, and then protest the arrests. But this is all part of a scenario of cooperation. However, if the PA takes Israel to the International Criminal Court, this would be a huge problem and a potential game changer in terms of their relationship with the PA. URL "

My shelf originally broke when they tried to blame Benghazi on a YouTube video. I just didn't want to admit it to myself. I knew it didn't pass the smell test, but I was of the ""this is how the sausage is made"" mindset and let it slide. The reason I finally decided to come forward is because the other day I was watching Fox, I think, and one of the shills was mocking the ""silent Trump vote"" and how it's a bucket Trump's campaign likes to frequently dip into, but it is unsubstantiated. And why is that? In the last two weeks, I have seen Democrats label Trump's supporters as racists, bigots, sexists, deplorable, Flat-Earthers with an 8th grade education, Islamaphobic, homophobic, so on and so forth. (Not to mention, all while splintering her support into categories themselves: LGBTQ, feminists, BLM-ers, etc.but that's a different topic all together.) We've also seen, not one, but TWO GOP HQs attacked (whether you want to call the second vandalism or not, I'm not here to argue semantics.) Why is it you think that people don't want to step forward? I'm totally gobsmacked that people would rather elect a criminal than someone they don't agree with on social issues. We have everything (via Wikileaks and Project Veritas) we always ever suspected about Hillary and people are too stubborn to even look and go, ""Wait a minute..."" Even journalists can't seem to report on the story without framing it in the context of Donald Trump. I'm also galled that everyone is saying Trump talking about voter fraud is some kind of ""strategy."" Since when is telling the truth a strategy? That, to me, seems like his main goal. Before I conclude this rant, I've been pondering the psychology of Wikileaks deniers. I think that, for a lot of people, they don't want to know the truth because it will question their entire worldview and make them wonder what else they've been lied to/been complacent about. For as much change as people say they are for, I don't think a lot of people could handle it. "

First, Obama gives away the internet to ICANN, a non-government entity stationed in LA, not controlled by the government, under a guise to have ""one open internet for all."" This was the first step of the plan, making it so the government is no longer ""able"" to control the internet. (If they kept control of the internet, they'd have backup systems in place to make sure it didn't go out in the event of the power grid being shut down, just like most government infrastructure won't be-- I'm sure they have a backup in place) 2. Second, Obama signed an [executive order](URL that allows government control of the power grid in the event of a solar flare or other ""disturbances."" It gives power to the Secretary of Defense ""(a) The Secretary of Defense shall ensure the timely provision of operational space weather observations, analyses, forecasts, and other products to support the mission of the Department of Defense and coalition partners, including the provision of alerts and warnings for space weather phenomena **that may affect weapons systems, military operations, or the defense of the United States.** "" ""(d) The Secretary of Energy shall facilitate the protection and restoration of the reliability of the electrical power grid during a presidentially declared grid security emergency associated with a geomagnetic disturbance pursuant to [**16 U.S.C. 824o-1**.](URL which includes ""(8) The term **'cybersecurity incident'** means a malicious act or suspicious event that disrupts, or was an attempt to disrupt, the operation of those programmable electronic devices and communication networks including hardware, software and data that are essential to the reliable operation of the bulk power system."" 3. Obama is trying to get into a war with Russia, along with the rest of the establishment. They might even stage a cybersecurity attack on or near election day in order to have... (e) The Secretary of Homeland Security shall: (i) ensure the timely redistribution of space weather alerts and warnings that support national preparedness, continuity of government, and continuity of operations; and **(ii) coordinate response and recovery from the effects of space weather events on critical infrastructure and the broader community.** *That is why Obama is trying to turn the voting systems into a ""critical infrastructure,"" and might even try to pass it as just the classification while allowing the Republicans to make exceptions that don't include an executive order like this.* In the event of a war with Russia, or a staged attach, or solar flare, they might try to take over all critical infrastructure including the power grid, which would **shut down the internet,** as ICANN headquarters is not in their control, and **their headquarters is in Los Angeles.** This could shut down the internet for all of those in ICANN, or they could use it as an excuse to shut it down. From there, no one would know about if the election is stolen. Once Hillary is declared the winner, Obama might even sign an executive order declaring her the sole winner or preventing any recounts in attempts to cover up all voter fraud. TL;DR: ICANN HQ in Los Angeles is on the power grid, and in the event of a fake EMP, or fake solar flare could cause the loss of communication across the country, allowing the department of homeland security to take control of the power grid, shutting off the internet, and allowing them to also take over the election if they successfully re-classify it as a critical infrastructure.

They point out that transferring control of domain names to a body like the UNs International Telecommunication Union (ITU) could leave autocratic nations like Russia, China, and even Iran in charge of the worlds most important free medium. &gt;U.S. control of domain names has guaranteed freedom of speech and commerce across the Internet, against the strenuous efforts of countries like China and Iran to suppress Internet traffic and content. In addition, victims of international terror have found potential relief in U.S. courts by suing to seize the domain names of countries like Iran in lieu of direct compensation. Without U.S. control, those victims would have no possible recourse. &gt;The Republican-controlled House passed legislation in 2014 to defund the ICANN transfer, and in 2015 to provide Congress with a 30-day period to review it when it happens. Earlier this year, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) introduced the Protecting Internet Freedom Act to prevent the transfer without Congressional approval. &gt;But while the bills have been debated, the administration has moved ahead, the Washington Examiner reports, with transfer scheduled Oct. 1. From the [Wall Street Journal report](URL a commentator posted a link to the PDF of the [""The Future of Internet Governance: Should the United States Relinquish Its Authority over ICANN?"" by Lennard G. Kruger (Specialist in Science and Technology Policy)](URL It is quite disturbing, to say the least. Here is Mr Kruger's concluding observation: &gt;The future of how ICANN and the DNS will be governed is highly relevant to the broader question of how the Internet should be governed. While it is true that ICANNs jurisdiction is limited to the technical underpinnings of the Internet (unique Internet identifiers such as domain names and addresses), **it is also true that ICANN policy decisions (such new gTLDs) can affect other areas of Internet policy such as intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, and Internet freedom.** As the Internet expands and becomes more pervasive throughout the world in all aspects of modern society, the question of how it should be governed becomes more pressing, with national governments recognizing an increasing stake in ICANN policy decisions, especially in cases where Internet DNS policy intersects with national laws and interests. ICANN is viewed by many as a ground-breaking example of multistakeholder governance. While ICANN does not control the Internet, how it is ultimately governed may set an important precedent in future policy debates both domestically and internationally over how the Internet might be governed, and what role governments and intergovernmental organizations should play goes through.

This is what the whistleblower organization reported: WikiLeaks releases 19,252 emails and 8,034 attachments from the top of the US Democratic National Committee -- part one of our new Hillary Leaks series. The leaks come from the accounts of seven key figures in the DNC: Communications Director Luis Miranda (10770 emails), National Finance Director Jordon Kaplan (3797 emails), Finance Chief of Staff Scott Comer (3095 emails), Finanace Director of Data &amp; Strategic Initiatives Daniel Parrish (1472 emails), Finance Director Allen Zachary (1611 emails), Senior Advisor Andrew Wright (938 emails) and Northern California Finance Director Robert (Erik) Stowe (751 emails). The emails cover the period from January last year until 25 May this year.d Subsequently, the Romanian hacker known as Guccifer 2.0 (who has denied he works with the Russian government), who has already released hundreds of hacked DNC emails previously, told The Hill he leaked the documents to Wikileaks. An initial read of the thousands of emails in the data dump reveals top officials at the Democratic National Committee privately plotting to undermine Bernie Sanderss presidential campaign, confirming a long-running allegation by the Sanders campaign who has claimed that the DNC and Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz had tipped the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton during the partys presidential primary. They also reveal instances of media collusion as well as various questionable instances of fundraising. In an email from early May, DNC CFO Brad Marshall wrote about a plot to question Sanderss religion. While not naming the Vermont senator directly, it talks about a man of Jewish heritage Marshall believes to be an atheist. It makes reference to voters in Kentucky and West Virginia, two states that were holding upcoming primary elections. It might may no difference, but for KY and WVA can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist, the email says. AMEN, DNC Chief Executive Officer Amy K. Dacey replied. Marshall did not respond to a request for comment. But he did tell The Intercept, which first noticed the email, I do not recall this. I can say it would not have been Sanders. It would probably be about a surrogate."" In an email that concerned Sanders out-polling Clinton in Rhode Island, where the state reportedly only had a fraction of voting stations open, one staffer took a contemptuous tone of Sanders supporters, speaking about them more as a nuisance than an arm of the party. If she outperforms this polling, the Bernie camp will go nuts and allege misconduct, the staffer writes, Theyll probably complain regardless, actually. Another email shows similar 'us and them' language being directed at Sanders supporters. We have the Sanders folks admitting that they lost fair and square, not because we 'rigged' anything, the email said. Clinton likely to win the state convention with a slim margin and we'll send a release with final delegate numbers. An email titled 'Bernie narrative' sent by DNC National Press Secretary Mark Paustenbach to Miranda indicates that top officials in the party were trying to find an angle to disparage the Vermont senator in the media. Wondering if there's a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never ever had his act together, that his campaign was a mess, Paustenbach wrote in the May 21 message. Specifically, [Debbie Wasserman Schultz] had to call Bernie directly in order to get the campaign to do things because they'd either ignored or forgotten to something critical. It's not a DNC conspiracy, it's because they never had their act together, Paustenbach suggested. Wasserman Schultz seemed to have already counted Sanders out of the race in a May 21 email, when there were still nine primaries to go. This is a silly story, the chairwoman said. He isn't going to be president. In another email, Paustenbach informed her that Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said the candidate should continue to the convention, Wasserman Shultz said: He is an ASS, referring to Weaver. The chairwoman made her opinion clear about Sanders in an message concerning the candidate alleging that the party hadnt been fair to him. Spoken like someone who has never been a member of the Democratic Party and has no understanding of what we do, she said. Collusion with Clinton and the media A communication from late May laid out the pros and cons of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz accepting an invitation to CBSs 'Face the Nation', and indicated that the DNC was plotting its moves based on what would be amenable to Hillary Clintons presidential campaign. Clinton campaign is a mess, theyre afraid of their own shadow and didnt like that we engaged, DNC communications director Luis Miranda wrote. But theyll be unhappy regardless, so better to get out there and do some strong pivots and land good punches on Trump. They cant tell us NOT to do TV right now, we shouldnt pull ourselves out until they actually do. Its clear that Bernie messed up and that were on the right side of history, Miranda wrote in another bullet point, referring to the Nevada convention. Let's take this offline, Wasserman Schultz said in response. I basically agree with you."" Wasserman Schultz and Miranda brainstormed ideas to attack Sanders position on the Israel/Palestine conflict with her communications team in one thread, with Wasserman Schultz saying that ""the Israel stuff is disturbing in reference to Sanders platform committee appointees attempts to include language denouncing the occupation of Palestinian territory in the Democratic platform. The chairwoman says that the idea HFA, or Hillary For America, originally proposed the idea of using Israel/Palestine as an ideal issue to marginalize Sanders on, suggesting that the DNC were exchanging communications about anti-Sanders strategies with the Clinton campaign. The DNC also made a secret agreement with Kenneth Vogel, an influential report for Politico. An email from late April with the subject line ""per agreement... any thoughts appreciated"" shows that Vogel sent an advanced copy of a story about Hillary Clintons fundraising to the DNC even before his editor even saw it. The published version of the story did not appear to have any significant edits from and was not favorable to the Clinton campaign, but the sending of a full, advanced copy to the subject of a story is considered to be a violation of journalistic ethics. A source with familiar with the interaction between Politico and the DNC told RT America that the message was sent to officials to ensure accuracy in the story, and that it would have been difficult to ask for piecemeal clarifications due to its complexity. The agreement, in fact, referred to the DNC promising not to pass the story to a more favorable news outlet who might publish before Politco. Another email released in the Friday leak indicates that the DNC was in close contact with news websites on articles related to the Democratic Party. A Real Clear Politics article said that Sanders supporters were causing a lack of unity at the Nevada Democratic Convention. This headline needs to be changed, Wasserman Schultz wrote to Miranda. We need to push back... Patrice, what happened, DNC had nothing to do with this, right? Miranda replied, referring to DNC Director of Party Affairs Patrice Taylor. Taylor responded saying that the article should be changed the event was run by the state party and the disorder sounds like internal issues amount [sic] Sanders supporters. Walter, please connect with Stewart and get him to push back, Miranda wrote. The last email on the thread says: Done. Article has been updated. Further evidence of the DNC's extensive ""content control"" over mass media was revealed when Wasserman Schultz sent an email to NBC anchor Chuck Todd with the subject line ""Chuck, this must stop,"" and set up a time for the two to talk about MSNBCs Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski calling on Wasserman Schultz to step down. In another email chain, Miranda said Brzezinski was willing to talk with Wasserman Schultz. ""She's already served as a judge and jury without even bothering to talk to me. Not sure why I should trust having a conversation with her would make any difference. Or that she even matters, to be frank,"" Wasserman Schultz wrote back after a brief exchange. In response to a New York Times story about Sanders's defiance in the wake May's unruly Democratic state convention in Nevada, Wasserman Schultz wrote: ""Every time they get caught doing something wrong, they use the tactic of blaming me. Not working this time."" To be sure, there has been a long trail of instances that confirmed Wasserman Schultz's clear and repeated bias, as noted most recently in ""DNC Head Threatened To Kick Michigan Mayor Out Of Debate For Cheering Bernie Sanders"", however this is the first time primary sourced evidence has justified such allegations. There seems to be clear bias in the aggregate as well. Searches of the database shows an apparent bias by DNC officials against Sanders just by how closely either campaign was monitored. A search of Sanders supporters yields 306 messages, while a search of Clinton supporters shows only 65 results. A search of his campaign yields 780 messages, while her campaign only brings up a paltry 120 results. Questionable Fundraising According to the Daily Beast, the DNC blocked Roy Black from hosting a potential Barack Obama fundraising event. Black is the lawyer of billionaire and level-three sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after reports on Epsteins trial from The Daily Beast and other outlets. The email states the DNC would still allow Black to donate and attend future events. In an email thread from May 12th of this year, titled Host for POTUS in Miami, DNC finance assistant Karina Marquez originally asked the committees vetting team to vet the following folks for POTUS please. The list of six possible hosts for the event included Black and his wife Lea, who is a star on Real Housewives of Miami. We were also asked to vet the following for POTUS hosting. The only issue is Roy Black, DNC Deputy Compliance Officer Kevin Snowden wrote back. New issues have come up since his last vet in February 2016. In a third email, DNC deputy finance director Laura Lopez clarified: Roy Black has been submitted to potentially attend meetings with (Jim) Messinathere isnt an event code yet. He and his wife co-hosted a fundraiser for POTUS in 2007, all the stories are new since then. Messina is the CEO of the Messina Group political strategy firm and led President Obamas reelection campaign in 2012. All the stories refer to, in part, a 2011 Daily Beast investigation called Behind Pedophile Jeffrey Epsteins Sweetheart Deal which was cited in a follow-up story in the New York Daily News, and other articles that are later embedded into the email thread. To close off the chain, White House political advisor Bobby Schmuck responded that he agreed with DNC compliance director Alan Reed. No hosting, fine to attend, he wrote. President Obama attended a Miami fundraiser at the home of Robert Rubenstein, one of the five other names listed in the vetting email, on the weekend of June 3rd, and Black was allowed to attend. Blacks client Epstein was convicted of soliciting sex from an underage girl in 2008 and paid out settlements to scores of alleged victims who said he serially molested them."" President Bill Clinton was said to have flown on Epsteins private jet, dubbed the Lolita Express, up to 26 times, sometimes eschewing Secret Service protection. There were further revelations. An internal email from DNC spokesman Eric Walker mocked a Buzzfeed news report analyzing the DNC and the Republican National Committees potentially weak cybersecurity. Another email shows DNC staffers fake craigslist job posting made for women who wish to apply to jobs at one of Trumps organizations. The fake position, titled a Honey Bunny, requires the prospective applicant to, among other tasks, refrain from gaining weight, be open to public humiliation and be alright with groping or kissing by her boss. Another email between DNC national finance director Jordan Kaplan and DNCs Northern California finance director Erik Stowe has Kaplan coarsely describing a conference call with President Barack Obama on National Small Business Week as related to small business sh*t. With the leaks coming just days before the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia it may reignite controversy over the DNC's handling of Sanders as well as media ""objectivity"" and Democrat fundraising, three of the most sensitive issue plaguing the Democratic party, and could potentially lead to an exodus of disappointed Bernie supporters into Trump's camp.

You may be voting for the next president who will have to steer us through a financial meltdown, and its all because we never truly learned from our mistakes. The financial crisis of 2008 happened because the banks were too big, they were too opaque and they were engaging in risky business practices. Where are we now? Many of the banks are much bigger, theyre still opaque and theyre still engaging in risky business practices. This is a recipe for (another) disaster. According to Noam Chomsky and other political and economic experts interviewed for this article, we may be heading to another major bank bailout. We dont actually know a lot of what goes on in banking, Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at Stanford University, told Salon. We dont have good monitoring of it. Admati said a lot of what banks do is deeply buried in vast financial records, so its extremely difficult to follow what industries banks are involved in and what theyre doing. She said the banks benefit from this opaqueness, because it means they can get away with risky business practices while no one knows whats going on. The banks are also very interconnected, in various ways. Through contracts and their investments, these enormous and volatile corporations are closely working together and exposing themselves to danger together, which means when one big bank falls, they all start to tumble. Thats why there may be a bailout, because the system is so connected, fragile and opaque, Admati said. Noam Chomsky, political philosopher and linguist, has said on several occasions that there will likely be another bank bailout in the not-too-distant future, because we havent reined the banks in or prevented them from growing. When we asked Chomsky the main reason another bailout may occur, he said that in brief, too big to fail, the implicit government insurance policy, which, according to the [International Monetary Fund], provides most of the profit of the big banks by various means. As Chomsky has explained before, the banks can take massive risks for massive profits because they know the government will bail them out if things go terribly wrong. Instead of ending the world of banks that are too big to fail and preventing banks from operating in ways that could again sink the economy, we have guaranteed them that the taxpayers are ready and waiting when they make another catastrophic mistake. One of the major risks banks take is not having enough equity to be considered stable. If there is a financial crisis, a bank with a lot of equity has a buffer that can help prevent it from failing, but many banks currently operate with less than 10 percent equity. The numbers are pathetic, Admati said. She said theyve improved slightly since the financial crash, but their equity numbers are still dangerously low. Through various mergers and expansions, these banks have become so large that its hard to fathom how large they truly are. All student debt in this country, which is considered a huge problem, is approximately $3 trillion, Admati said. That is a fraction of JPMorgan Chase. That is like half of the accounting numbers of JP Morgan Chase. She said these banks have their hands in nearly every part of the economy, and theyre not going to get smaller any time soon unless something is done. Richard Wolff, a professor of economics emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, also believes we are facing another major bailout if things dont change soon. He said the growth of student and auto loan debts relative to mass capacity to carry such debts could be the cause. Admati proposed a more sinister future event that could crash the economy, and it makes you think of the USA Network show Mr. Robot.

She pointed to the cyberheist that happened earlier this year, where the Federal Reserve Bank of New York lost $81 million to hackers. Imagine that on a bigger scale, she said. Both Wolff and Admati pointed out that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which came after the 2008 financial crisis and was meant to prevent another one from happening, hasnt adequately changed how banks operate. Wolff said Dodd-Frank, as its been used, hasnt prevented big banks from getting bigger and has failed to address the huge problem of active collusion between major bank lenders and politicians. He said bankers and politicians are still cutting dangerous loan deals for mutual benefit. ADVERTISEMENT Dodd-Frank tries to do a lot of things, Admati said. It gives all kinds of authorities to regulators, the same regulators who failed before, it gives them more slightly different authorities to prevent [another bailout], supposedly, or to deal with it. However, Admati said, it has not been used in a way that would prevent another bailout. Beyond the issues that have already been mentioned, banks still have not submitted acceptable living wills that are supposed to explain how the biggest banks plan to stay afloat in the face of a future financial crisis. The credit rating agencies that gave bad investments good ratings before 2008 are still in need of major reform. Plus, much of the rules Dodd-Frank was supposed to create still havent been finalized years later. Im not happy, because I think they can do much better, Admati said of the politicians who swore they would prevent another crash. Things can be done. As Bernie Sanders explained, politicians can use Dodd-Frank to break up the big banks. The credit rating agencies can be reined in. We can finalize the Dodd-Frank rules and enforce them. We can demand the banks be more transparent and carry more equity. And if we do not do these things, we will likely be pulling out our wallets when the banks skip out on the bill again. Remember, its the banks that get bailed out when the economy crashes, not the people."

So that means that we're bad at cybersecurity. Okay. Buzzfeed: These Experts Think The DNC And RNC Are Both Horrible At Cybersecurity&lt;URL Both the Democratic and Republican National Committees have handed out hundreds of thumb drives to reporters ahead of their national conventions, in a move cybersecurity experts call ""borderline stupidity."" posted on May 5, 2016, at 4:47 p.m. SAN FRANCISCO - Keeping America safe from the armies of hackers at the shores, has come up a lot in the 2016 election cycle but if the Republican and Democratic National Conventions are anything to go by, whichever party wins the race for president has not studied up on their cybersecurity basics. Reporters who registered for the Republican and Democratic National Conventions were given tote bags by convention organizers filled with instructions and logistical information. Buried inside the totes were thumb drives, also known as USB flash drives, with information on the upcoming events. ""Who does that anymore? It's just asking to get infected with any variety of malware,"" said Ajay Arora, CEO of VERA&lt;URL a cybersecurity firm. ""Those thumb drives are the number one way to infect a computer... It is borderline stupidity to give them out to people, or for people to even think of using them."" Thumb drives are known within the cybersecurity world for their fundamental security weaknesses, because when someone plugs a thumb drive into their computers they are opening up their system to anything on that drive - from the best hotels to stay in during the Republican National Convention to a virus that silently uploads itself onto the hard drive. Neither the Republican or Democratic National Committees replied to a BuzzFeed News inquiry about the thumb drives. Jason Haddix, director of technical operations at Bugcrowd&lt;URL a security-testing startup, said that in the past he would help private companies test their internal security by dropping random USB sticks around their building and parking lot. ""We would drop them off or even hand them out as freebies to see who would fall for it and use the thumb drives. We had them install a program where we could show the company exactly which employee was using it and how we easily we could track their computers,"" Haddix said. It's the kind of trick hackers might use if they were trying to infect a company's internal system, and it shows how easy it is to move malware from a thumb drive onto a computer. Arora said it's been at least five years since he's seen a thumb drive handed out at a conference in the U.S., though he admits he normally attends cybersecurity events where ""no one is dumb enough to do this anymore."" ""These politicians are saying they want to decide what to encrypt, and what to regulate and give back doors to, are these same people who are turning around and saying here, take this piece of hardware which is proven to be the worst thing security wise, and put it into your computer,"" said Arora.
